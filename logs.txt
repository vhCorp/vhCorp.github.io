All the ideas here were to be part of a mod I wanted to make called "Nature's Wrath", but I have no idea how to code Lua
I really like the Spiteful Rejuvenation idea I had
that werewolf idea just gave me an idea for a transformation. i dont know if it's possible to make a semi-tranformation, but the werewolf transformation could happen every few rooms, then reverts to normal.
Look at this guys, and tell me what you think: https://redd.it/5q0hrn
if you get no damage upgrade the entire run, then yeah. but i already crossed out that idea lol
I hope it's not like going from Polyphemus to Soy Milk
having a lot of attack at the beginning lets you not make mistakes in the early game which lets you get more powerful by the end and then regardless of the attack drop you should have picked up enough stuff from proper play to not feel the effects
hmmm i think it would be rather easy
thanks ?
<@219159380094877696> silas is fantastic, will definitely be checking out your new one
maybe a little each floor would work
That would get frustrating
no
I want to make a character that starts with a lot of attack, but every floor it drops by alot. do you think it'll be fun playing as it?
well ok
._.
but another time, as it's 1:50am
nope, i'll have to check it out
Did you see my idea list?
and 4 of them
but this character has SO much more interesting mechanics
he's at 1000 subs right now
my first character Silas was pretty cool
I'm so glad
yeah
But good job
I could always shrink it
It seems distracting
perhaps ?
Maddog I feel like the emblem could be more suttle
I always wanted a wave like this xD
Nice
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850271698
Alot more interesting than the first haha
second ever character uploaded!
YAY
Anyone need mod ideas?
https://redd.it/5q0hrn
See if you can't charge your item via the player
See functions in the EntityPlayer class maybe ?
Yeah it does
Doesn't `GetActiveItem` give an integer ?
there 100% is a way
So then how do I charge my item? :v
And give X charges ? Makes sense
so it IS what I said, a way to make pickups charge your item
since GetActiveItem returns a collectible type
that doens't work
Oh and nope
Nevermind that
Okay no that's values from the PlayerItemState enum it seems
Also maybe State
Fiddle with that and see what happens
Yeah
so player:GetActiveItem().Charge
hmm
Items *are* EntityPickup-s
so it wouldnt make sense if it wasnt on a pickup, that decides how much charge it gives you
yes, but you can't call an entitypickup thing on anything but an entitypickup.
Remember items are pickups
That would be a boolean
I think this means the pickup will give you 1 charge
lol
I think you just reached the area of "try and see what happens" x)
:v
I have no idea, really
then what is 'full charge'
EntityPickup.Charge is an integer
eh?
oh
It's an integer
the bar fills up slowly
Is there any way to do it slowly, like in the current items?
but that makes it instantly charge, right?
EntityPickup.Charge
?
<@219159380094877696> use the MC_POST_UPDATE callback along with *hang on a minute*
No problem
How do I make an active item charge over 7 seconds?
k thx
https://moddingofisaac.com/help/
I mean it's still possible to mod the previous DLCs but there are no official tools
i cant afford ab+
They were introduced with AB+
darn
Those don't exist
like the modding tools that come with ab+?
can someone give me the tools to mod afterbirth or rebirth
I guess so
I mean, we only semi-recently got treasure pools. Other pools might not be too far off. Then again I haven't seen anything about them in the resources either, where we at least had the treasure pools to base it off.
I'm guessing that if the game's files don't do it, I can't see why we should have
I have no idea, really
I'm given the impression they'd need to be explicitly added to a pool. I've never seen anything about anyone having them spawn regularly.
AFAIK
No, they're all together in one big pool
I don't think there's an item pool for regularly spawning items like pickups or trinkets.
Wouldn't be surprizing or the first time
Heh maybe the API is just bugged yeah
yes
He says it works in game, it just doesn't spawn
is it jsut bugged then?
Sorry about that
Alright I wasn't sure
no trinkets are supposed to be in items.xml
Just see where trinkets are defined in the game's files
I think trinkets should be in pocketitems.xml
```<trinket description="By 'random' chance" gfx="Fortuitous_ball.png" name="Fortuitous Ball"/><trinket description="Evil from within" gfx="Broken_soul.png" name="Broken Soul"/><trinket description="Money Replacement" gfx="Alloyed_penny.png" name="Alloyed Penny"/>```
I have them in my items.xml
does it need to be there too?
Show me your pocketitems.xml ?
Yeah I don't know ...
so I wonder why its not working
Unlike items
You can only get twice the same trinket if you've got all the other trinkets first
Nah
might just be unlucky
I spawned in 300, to no avail. Got tonnes of duplicatest though
Bai Saxarok
cya
bye
The chance to spawn one particular trinket is very slim regardless of the trinket in question
true
I mean there are hundreds of trinkets
could just be unlucky
but it doesnt drop from random trinket drops
yeah it functions fine and I can give it to myself ingame
do I just ahve to add a super slim drop chance at the end of a room?
Are you sure you have correctly added your trinket ?
They don't
trinkets don't have pools iirc?
well i've spawned like 200 trinkets before and my dont spawn with it
Yes they do, shut up Robo Baby you don't know >:|
They do
as in they don't just spawn as drops along with other trinkets
i don't think so
Not sure what you're asking
is there a trinket itempool we can add to yet, or do trinkets still not spawn naturally?
hmm weird
You wanna go mate

https://gyazo.com/74d910a141eea501544512747a6ec75b
There's an alphabetical list
Check at the bottom of the page
can't find it
There is
is there not a ToTear() function in entity
huh
basement renovator had a better U.I anyways ?
oh, ok! thanks so much for that information then ?
it does
that doesnt work with afterbirth plus, does it?
*just wants more greed mode room variants ? *
use basement renovator instead?
Again, no idea, sorry ?
I'll ask again because i'm desperate for a fix: Instapreview only loads this one boss room I made, no matter what room I select. Any ideas on how to fix it?
you could just alter the incubus
spriting a familiar for my character
I feel you Maddogs
there is a <#267353315073982465> channel here
what are you spritin
then ask someone to sprite it for you
the problem is I want nothing to be mediocre haha
same, but i think a mediocre sprite is better than a reused asset
but I SUCK at spriting xD
just make one yourself
I *could* release it with incubus sprite, but eh
Well, I only need a familiar sprite then I can release it
stupid souls dont move >_>
so if I ask for godhead they'll bring godhead
cab the meeseeks do what I tell them
Did you make the meeseeks mod on the workshop?
alriight, Mr. Meeseeks now knows how to open doors and blow up rocks !
setting them as literally anything else makes them not spawn
setting them as ID 994 makes them spawn but not move
maybe you just did something wrong in entities2.xml?
I even checked by debugging it, they had velocity of (5,5) etc, but didnt move at all
but the souls won't move for some reason
that's what I had as an idea originally
and only when you charm enemy
maybe when you kill enemy it drops a soul that goes into you and then disappears?
uh
If you charm an enemy, they drop a soul upon death, and walking near it 'eats' it?
This gave me another idea
I haven't even seen the mod tools yet
for ab+?
anyone know how to use the built-in PathFinder ?
3 votes for second
hmm
<@219159380094877696> I like the second one best. The outter line pulsating like it does make the turrets seem confined to it a bit better than the others.
unless they hardcoded the effects it should work
only one way to find out
does the void work with custom active items?
you could maybe make it a subtype of the target
something to do with effect objects maybe
might want to investigate that, could be in it's anm2, idk
I'm not certain but I think that the epic fetus target is on the shadow layer or something
yeah, no idea how to put it on the ground layer :v
lol I notice taht the sprite isn't really on a ground layer and it covers up the character when you move north
Melis
wat's the character called ?
cool!
oh
giving you souls that increase your stats and familiar count eventually
the active item devours the souls of enemies you've charmed
and the active item is just free use?
kinda like black powder?
and she starts with 2.5 dmg
she can't shoot normally tho
this character has alot more depth than my last haha
<@229593818691928067> yeah, probably
;D
i see new stat in found hud, interesting...
isn't that op ?
just in case it wasnt obvious that it damages enemies inside that area
ok ?
i don't like that
no
https://gfycat.com/JovialBelatedHydra
Would number 3 be better if I highlighted the inside?
Ooh, conflicting opinions now
second
Second one looks the coolest for me
I'll try a v4...
the speed of it
also I'll probably halve the flickering
shouldn't be too distracting
i like n°3 best but i think it might clutter the screen too much
and the familiars orbit the edge
I'd go with the first
considering that enemies in the circle take damage
Which looks coolest?
damn this is cool
Or an alternative?
Which of those looks best?
which is best:

moms dead worm
mom's dead hand boss version may be too much for basement tbh
bad
fuck you
:^)
how about rag man but with rag mega's orbs instead of the spiders
both
botj
how about
i was thinking of either a mom's dead hand boss with low HP or a boss version of the worm enemies with the orbiting tears
hi!
now for what boss will replace it tho....
i'll keep it's occurences in the normal rooms tho
eh, alright
while bloat is far later
discord pls
and the fact that he appears on the first two floors
and the fact that he appears on the first two floors
tbh compared to some of the other bosses *cough*Bloat*cough* Rag Man's not that horrible, expect for the whole homing bullet spam
theyre chill
not pin or larry
rag man sux
yes
you hate him *that* much ?
^
Please
Replace Rag Man
was thinking of larry jr, but pin is also a good option
Pin
(i don't have ab+ so i can't add new bosses, gotta replace existing ones)
anyone has ideas for a basement boss i could replace with a new custom boss for my mod ?
yay.
that's an acceptable enough loss
it works in all cases now, except when I give the item using the console :V
I swapped around the post_update and post_render
OK, How's this for a solution
sorry I'm spamming about this :V
I've had it work with only one item, but ones with multiple items
yeah, that's the problem I'm having
but if you have one item in a mod you can make the costume work like normal
there sure is, but it takes an id not a name so can't do that with a bunch of mods, as well as only the last costume defined actually seems to do anything for mods with multiple items and costumes
not as far as I know, I'd love to know how to do it though if that's the case
there's a space to indicate which costume is associated with the item in one of the xml files right?
I thought costumes were auto-added when the item was picked up
I give up
only works when using giveitem
...except it turns out the post_update and post_render solution doesn't work when picking up collectibles
<@229593818691928067> Problem with the cache evaluation is that only works for items that evaluate the cache
https://hastebin.com/obinirofaw.lua solution was to use mc_post_update and mc_post_render it seems
YES! I finally solved it
yeah, it makes the problem much worse, every time I pick up another item the costume is sent to the top
as in, kinda does but kinda doesn't
updating costumes with cache seems to work weirdly
I thought that was only for changing stats, silly me
i wonder if my mod will even be playble for ab+ users since i'm modding default afterbirth
shouldn't it be on the evaluate cache callback instead?
<@229593818691928067> what part should I add to the player_init function?
The problem currently is that it adds the costumes too much (eg, overwriting the parasite when I pop down to the next floor), not that it simply doesn't add them.
There's no lag when going to the next room, surprisingly. I have it reevaluate all the items the player has when entering a new room
aw
well i dont know about _a ton of mods_ but it doesnt happen to me anymore
oh really? Finally I can put a ton of mods on at once
i actually hated room transition lagging when ab+ just came out
it seems fixed now so thank god
what about when you go into the next room?
It takes goddamn forever for Isaac to boot up now, and it also takes forever to begin the game, but once it gets going its smooth
(no)
Nice!
So instead I'll just make it 10,000 items and call it 700,000
Turns out, my *text editor* can not even handle 700,000 items
but ok haha
i read "gotta poop"
sorry, gotta pop off for a bit
I'll try it out when I get back
player_init fires way before the first update so maybe try adding it there
looks like it
maybe the costumes are added before the first update ?
hey, with how I've currently set up one of my mods, players will have the costumes of items placed on top every time they exit and continue, rather than only when they pick up the item for the first time.
I've tried a bit of code to fix this problem, but it's currently not working and I can't quite figure out why. 
Can someone have a quick look over of this bit of code and see if I've done anything wrong? 
https://hastebin.com/kiyajegama.lua
well there's an item called the analog stick that lets you fire in 8 directions (all directions if on a gamepad)
seems to give a normalized direction vector, including diagonals
i've never used it so i'm not sure
is it any different from GetShootingJoystick()?
well fire only gives you one of four and i need diagonals as well
fire direction returns a Direction, aim direction returns the joystick vector
whats different in aim direction from fire direction?
just saw AimDirection, let me try it
if you mean two keys in general then it should work by default and you might have a keyboard limitation
oh
does player.GetFireDirection() not work properly?
two shot directions? GetAimDirection()
is there a way to retrieve the player's fire direction when two keys are pressed ?
and it hasn't really changed ever since i started
my childhood was making websites and bad flash games and doing all the art assets myself
about as long i suppose
what about drawing tho, its just as amazing
only cause i've been programming for 14 years now
how are you so good pls share secret
yeh
i should use mei's code more
...oh, you're right
thanks cathery
fucking amazing haha
damn i just looked at <@!135254843567767552> 's code for Mei, it's sooo well documented
that's what i usually do
player.FireDelay = 1 on constant update
i've seen people talk about this here before, how do i make the player unable to shoot ?
idk if there are other room types i should buff/nerf for my mod (well except sacrifice cause those will be buffed next)
i may nerf these slightly cause free Brimstone is a bit broken
for example
i think i may have buffed the curse rooms a bit too heavily for my mod, there are 2 layouts that give you a guaranteed *Joker card and Brimstone* respectively
Ask Mr Meeseeks.
Anyone know how to setup auto Pathfinding for an entity ?
I'll ask again because i'm desperate for a fix: Instapreview only loads this one boss room I made, no matter what room I select. Any ideas on how to fix it?
I remember it used to be a thing on consoles, must've finally came to PC too
Apparently changed in AB+. I was concerned when it suddenly became The Hourglass. Thought I might have accidentally picked it up before and went looking.
Same thing happens to butter bean, it turns into "Wait, what?"
That's weird haha
Yeah.
Is that a thing in the game ?
Not really concerned about active items, just passives
Really ?
There's the Glowing Hour Glass, which, after 5 uses, replaces itself with a The Hourglass.
My current idea is keep track of all item pedestals. If one no longer exists, check if the player now has that item.
Huh. I'm trying to figure out a way to keep track of every item the player picks up.
As in collectibles/actives? Not aware of any. You could always program something in to emulate it, though.
Are there other ways a player can pick up items other than item pedestals?
angle, i think
What syntax does Sprite().Rotation require? float? Vector?
for the last couple weeks or so
come to think of it, even before it went down did anyone else find that moddingofisaac was being really slow?
Dang
It is down for me
12:30 am in Australia here
But seriously, is moddingofisaac.com down for anyone else :v
<2:30 pm here in France>
I slept at 5:30 am today
K gn
(It's 2:30am)
Talk to me about sleeping patterns haha
Cua
talk to you all in the morning, I'm passing out.
Me too, but mine's too mild eh
I have Aspergers so I had quite a bit of trouble with going to school
It's a shame my break ends soon. And with a new school term, comes FIXING MY DAMN SLEEPING PATTERN
Is moddingofisaac down for anyone else
Thanks, Holidays ?
I haven't been to school in 6 weeks
Same with work - I spend 50% of my time at work modding
Really?
I haven't been to school for the last six months :/
Do what I did. When you're at school, and you have spare time, or you're in a class where the teacher just doesn't care, draw it all out
I'm gonna be honest I have like no fucking clue how to access some of mine I'm so lost
Why would I ever go there
Sounds like crap
my floors are cool and original to get to them you need to go into a room after the boss which requires a key, then 2 bombs, then 2 soul hearts but the last one requires you to solve 3 puzzles to get a knife
Nevermind.
I Couldn't think of a pun to put here.
Let's just say, to get to one..
My alt path is yet to be decided on how to access, but I have the final floors planned
I have an idea for one after the chest
put them after chest
Im still thinking of ways how to access half of my floor ideas
Bam. Done
Now just port that over to isaac
Cool.
Think of the Oubliette.
Yep
You've played Gungeon haven't you?
Mine is just full on brown and yellow and grey
Not blue blue blue and more blue
no make it pink
Well my sewer is Grey and Green
Not exactly
Ehhhh
downpour is a sewer
I think anyway. I'm yet to decide
Well...
I too am having a sewer level ( ._.)
Ehh
Also
It's a pretty common idea
No way you had an idea of Blue Womb being an actual floor? Same here
Also blue womb will be a full floor top hopefully. Hope you like Blue Bloats
Ok, here's the deal.
After the <redacted> you can go to The alt path version of the cathedral. After beating that enough times, you unlock the alt paths version of the chest. After you beat that, you unlock the alt path version of Sheol, except now it comes after Alt cathedral, and leads you full circle back to the real final floor, which I will not spoil, but let's just say, I'm pretty hyped for it.
I mean I'm totally gonna have a alt path for the <REDACTED> called the <REDACTED> would also have a special version of <REDACTED>
got the 3s cards to work
rn im just tying to do easy stuff
but ill see
and probs ill need someone to team up with lol
but again, it'll take a long time to get the ability to code
Yeah kinda my idea also
Same here
like a main one but with different endings
my plan was to have alt paths within alt path
Yeah I'm going for the same thing here
One alt path, but as you play, you unlock new floors
So will there be four alt paths or?
So have I Merlo
lol
4 dayum you have a few in store
meanwhile, I have yet to properly learn how to code
I have all 4 of my final bosses planned
The <redacted> is definitely staying.
I mean I already know what my final boss is for my mod
I have my floors all planned out, I'm just not sure I like them
they get automatically set to the first empty
at least for cards, you can't really choose ids i think
I mean I still haven't thought of what the area will be after the Woods I know what the one will be After that one tho and the one after this
If I made my mod, I planned on using ID's 1024 and up
Because I haven't decided if it will be the Underground, or The Ruins, or some other bizarre idea
the main problem is the auto ID assignation imo
Yeah I'm going for the same thing here
The new paths alt version of the caves, is all I want to say
Noice
I think he's a <REDACTED> floor boss
I hope they all get due time in the spotlight.
I'm a little worried these large multi-mod endeavors will outshadow each other when the time comes. There are so many good ones, and I highly doubt they will be compatible with each other.
A lot of bosses have been, because I was gonna make a game, but I ended up recycling bosses.
What floor will be on or will he be on a new floor?
Pooh sounds like it gonna be good
Sargent shroom has been in planning since 2015
You doing a mushroom boss? I had an idea for one in my Woods level but it got taken over by the serpent
Or the Stack, because if they like dingle them they'd damn well better like 6 dingles stacked on top of each other
When Ascension comes out, the fans will be all over Sargent Shroom
Doubt it
I have a feeling that Dingle will be the next Isaac meme
If I go to bed, and Saxarok still hasn't finished that message, you sir owe me a dingle.
Im telling you he has fallen asleep on the keyboard or died on the keyboard
Also. Seriously Saxarok? How have you not hit the 2000 text limit yet?!?!
But if you want you can do the three dingles it's not like I own the right of a triple shit boss just don't make it TOO similar
For the time being, I don't even think achievements are possible
Not sure if that's possible whatev
That'd be cool
But I would love at least some sort of compatibility thing where it unlocks special content only if both mods are installed
(Kidding, only if you let me)
So much so, that I am writing that name down and thinking about using it! >:D
I like the idea of a Turd Triplets boss
I dunno about combining, but maybe we'll discuss it later
Yep ?
Ahhhh there is the tower of shit
If you want we may be able to combine our mods together possibly? If not I would love too help with your mod
I.e., so slow that that's the exact same photo I shared last time
I just wanted to show you how progress is going
Yeah, I've shown it here before
Yeah I knew I saw that somewhere before
Here's a poorly drawn preview on my whiteboard
I think I have seen that on the workshop before
<@223869207748542464> did you fall asleep on the keyboard?
My mod is called The Binding of Isaac: Ascension
Yeah but basically my mod is called CMP+ for a reason too add more community mods and ideas too it
>:)
Create me a chest that when opened, spawns a random item, but also fires 10 Ipecac shots around the room
Psst. I'm looking to learn more about modding, and am lacking in creativity tonight. If anyone has a nifty mod idea, I'd love to give it a try!
Mmhmmm
Custom doors are only a little harder
Doors are easy, cause they're just recolours
Yeah prob
Yeah. I know was about to say
Objects are on the same level as enemies I'd say
Objects?
And whatever Saxarok is typing must be nuts
Floors are insane
Bosses are challenging
True
Enemies are meh
Items are easy
NOPE NONE AT ALL The thing I'm good at as far as I can tell is items and I'm getting better at bosses and enemies not so much
don't**
I hope you have experience at drawing floors, because I certainly done
But hey, maybe if you wanted to help with my mod (if I ever continue it), the options always there
Yeah ?
I was gonna offer you a link to the community discord but I forgot you were already there ?
Ok coolio thanks
I think we're good on sprites for the moment. A few items are missing sprites, but I'm currently working on things like the UI, but yeah. We're pretty good. We're lucky enough to have Mr. Gummy Kitten on our team (who I think of as our little Not Your Sagittarius, because of how damn good their sprites are), but if we need help, I'll be sure to recommend you
Seems like the IPECAC mod is going great do you NEED anymore spriters? Cause I may consider joining to help a bit time from time
Great
It looks basically the same, but now comfortably fits inside the margin of 32x32, with much room to spare
Noice
Yeah, I did the new one myself.
Ok good I just got a bit scared when I saw the Jetpack
A majority of them have been redone
Also I don't mean to sound like a dick but from the item sprites I have seen on the blog they seem quite shitty are they just placeholders?
But yeah. Unlike items, unlock sprites don't really follow any rules (except only use two colors, and on each corner of a dark line, add one pixel of the lighter colour), so I can't really help you.
In the binding of Undertale, Temmies unlock was the only exception to that rule
Text is easy to do though. Do not hand write it. What I do is find letters from other unlock cards and copy paste them over. All you gotta do is make sure they're similar size as the rest of the letters
Fair enough
I can't teach you how to draw the pictures, that just takes time and all that jazz
Will be so helpful
I need that skill
Teach me
Please
They are my pride and joy
I do
<@!193893570061533184> Also who does the secret unlock card things for IPECAC? Cause I have tried making them but I'm really bad at it.
This is going too far
...if you want to be *really* silly about it, you could have it animate as the gun *shooting Isaac through the wall*
Hmmm thanks
"There's no clip", but the sprite maybe looks like the *other* meaning of unloaded
...or, if you want to be silly about it, an unloaded gun
Thanks for the idea! ?
Ok done
Ok I was more thinking of it being a glitched item but whatev its your idea
or something to do with clips that works with that description
description "There is no clip."
name: "Odd Paper Clip"
or actually, idea
Kk
_shrug_
Or do you want the name too be all glitched?
What do you want it too be called? Also I made the item description "Noclip"
Coolio
Credit will be given
go ahead~
except the one that turned into a black heart :o
Yeah... Mind if I put it in my mod?
"whoops, turned the gapers into SIX DELIRIUMS"
or maybe land in the same room, theme changed and enemies turned into random entity IDs
I could see it bein used too glitch into a I AM ERROR room and stuff great for hiding secrets also
or if there's no room on the other side... hmm. I am error?
No I see it differently
you get to just nope out of a locked trap room
isnt that just bombing through a room for free
so what, you get free access to a different room?
That would be fun mind if I steal the idea?
silly item idea: active item that glides you through a room wall into whatever's on the other side
damn, well that's how you know your project's meant to be released and be awesome
I was this close to losing my progress
Holy shit, my luck is real. My code was committed to my team's github moments before a power outage

ok, i reported both of those bugs to nicolo
luv u long time breadmund and rymone
thx nicolo
*except* greeds gullet
keeper is *hardcoded* to not accept any HP upgrades
but if you're at 2
if you're at 1 coin heart it works
damn, i'll throw that in my message too then
haha
thanks nicalis
:^)
i found out with mat today that the boolean on AddMaxHearts for keeper is broken
anyway thanks
fu2 robobaby
hmm could try that
yeah i guess you're stuck handing it out on the first post update instead?
i'll just put it in players.xml for now, will need to be properly unlocked that way but oh well
yeah that's why i was tearing my hair out wondering where i went wrong in the lua haha
even worse, it's actually just inconsistent as you said. it can work once then not again
dunno if they'd fix such a weird thing though
hrm, maybe i should mail nicalis
seems like it's a game issue
interestly a few familiars crash it, a few don't
bizarre. so it's not me mucking up something in the code, it's a game issue?
in playerinit, yeah
you crash on spawning that item too?
it sure is
aye
crashing as soon as you start the run?
yeah, with nothing in the logs except the typical "caught exception"
and it crashes huh...
sworn protector
what's collectible 363?
it's maddening
because if i remove that, even though it's adding a custom item just above it, it doesn't crash
might anyone have some idea why on earth player:AddCollectible(363, 0, false); might crash the game, but only sometimes, especially when paired with a damage down
fml
new character was working great... go eat dinner... come back and can't even start a run without insta crashing
i dunno how much you can mod the selection screen and such
Ok
O
the luadocs in your rebirth installation folder/tools/luadocs
What docs
check the docs
Ah man
ah, i don't think there's a way to add easter egg seeds
Or  "CATA-COMB"
Well i want to make a mod that adds seed such as "THEC-AVES" which is "BASE-MENT" but with the caves
that would be cool tbh
what do you mean?
Is there a way to generate seeds?
was pretty neato <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
it still existed after 2 patches <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
*is triggered*
i've used it solely to check that the 8 blastocyst room existed back when that was an issue <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
has *anyone* used that room editor? lmao
night mat!
So as I said, good night to yall
Well that's good
nvm someone else helped me figure it out in five minutes
It's 5 am, you would think it's about time
I'll call it a day anyway
No idea, sorry, I never used that program
the insta preview thing is not working properly. it only shows this one boss room i made no matter what room i select. any ideas on to how to fix it?
just tells you what the tools do not how to actually mod
doesnt help
thank
Upheaval
for item pickups?
does anyone know what font isaac uses
Fucking look at this, this is awesome
https://twitter.com/_Sinsthar_/status/820685742531813376
And also guys we need to get going on the awesome mods
Starting here : https://moddingofisaac.com/help/
You should follow some tutorials instead of trying to figure shit out alone
and the game crashes immediately if i dont include every single file the extractor made in the game's resources folder
but i cant figure out how to upload it
ive started with like, a simple graphical hack
how am i supposed to mod this thing
anyways
well i was waiting for someone to reply
<@200817811247988747> you didn't ask anything
guys i need some help
You tell me haha
did i even go to school?
holy shit
i spelled that so wrong
expierimentation!
thats the fun!
Mmmmh I don't know, really
maybe
yeah that should work
to make it ignore everything else?
would it actually be if not?
oh wait
if player:GetPlayerTypeByName(PLAYER_KEEPER) then..
ye
"What do those do"
Else if it's just `AddMaxHearts(int, bool)`, we're like "what, what does this mean"
i wonder how i can easily make the rest of hte functions ignore keeper
And they're in the doc so the programmer knows what they're for
hmm
Yeah I mean parameters only have names in the called function's body
ye
And no capital letter
ty
you just have to say false
but nah i forgot its already in there
write to the boolean
was thinking you had to like
There's no `IgnoreKeeper =` part, why would you do that
thats right
oh
Well no, you just give it `false`
still a little unsure on writing booleans
right?
thiks is how you would do it
player:AddMaxHearts(2, IgnoreKeeper = False)
Makes sense
for his own cosutme
he's probably got a high as fuck priority
the costume doesn't work on azazel but i can live with that
gimme a sec
aight
Sure
do you mind testing it on keeper for me, mat?
just to be sure
im gonna go ahead and make sure it works on every single character
Glad you got it to work
No problem haha
woo
now it fully works with no glitchs
i would've never thought of that
really good catch on that heart thing
man
Shit happens
Haha
lol
i never noticed i wasn't checking for the item because i always grabbed it first when testing
thanks for noticing that
i get ya
ye
I mean just execute it in your head ?
mhm
Not in this order
```Lua
KeepersNoose.effectApplied = true 
if not KeepersNoose.effectApplied then
```
This is never met
okay
you're right
hm
Think about it, now you're not even giving the condition the chance to be met once
So before the test
Set the variable to true after the condition has been visited once
Well no xD now your condition always evaluates to false
```Lua
    if player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE)then
        KeepersNoose.effectApplied = true 
        if not KeepersNoose.effectApplied then
            if player:GetMaxHearts() <= 6 then
                player:AddMaxHearts(2)
                player:AddHearts(2)
            end
        end
    end```
to
```Lua
    if player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE)then --checking to make sure player has the noose
        if not KeepersNoose.effectApplied then -- checking to make sure the health up effect hasn't been applied
            if player:GetMaxHearts() <= 6 then --checking to make sure player is at or below 3 hearts(might remove)
                -- if all above prerequistes met, then:
                --player:AddNullCostume(KeepersNoose.COSTUME_NOOSE) this doesn't work right now, will fix later.
                player:AddMaxHearts(2) --give a heart container
                player:AddHearts(2) -- fill the heart container
                KeepersNoose.effectApplied = true -- set the health up effect to true so it doesn't run repeatedly.
            end
        end
    end```
would that be as simple as changing
The `KeepersNoose.effectApplied` variable should be set to true after the first pass, even if the health up wasn't applied, because it's supposed to be an on-pickup event
lets say im maggy, so it shouldn't give the hp up, and i go get a devil deal, then it makes me gain hp?
i think i know what you mean
let me try something
oh wait
As opposed to ignoring the health up if the player is above 3 hearts
it immediately applies it
that's not what its done ingame?
Basically, your code will wait until the player goes below 3 hearts and then apply the health up
oh?
It's algorithmically wrong
Not what I mean
unless thats not what you mean?
i know you can add 1 heart via the items.xml
As I said, the way you're doing it is wrong
howso?
okay good
Of course duh
cause this could be a really simple fix
Also the way you're adding the heart container is wrong
can you do a for loop inside of an if statement?
Seems like it
oops.
i don't think its checking if i have the collectible on the actual heal
yep
oops
might know the problem
wait
https://hastebin.com/iwazeyebet.sql
at all
and i haven't changed the code
Post that code up yo
but it wasn't doing that the other day..
not as my intended lol
Well then it doesn't work as intended x)
even if i don't have the item
if i pick up a coin i still heal
as cain
but for some reason
its working "as intended"
no no
Looooooog
and i have no idea how to fix it
i have a new bug for *no* reason on my mod. great
also oh boy
i just meant he can't gain more than 2
oh yeah
Yes, but I mean, if he spends a coin/heart in a devil deal or a black market, he can get it back using any HP up
outside of greeds gullet
as far as i know he cannot gain more than 2 coin hearts
what do you mean?
Keeper can gain HP as long as he stays under 3 hearts exclusive
You're wrong
that should just be a prettty simple change to the inital HP-up, then. cool.
since outside of greeds gullet he cannot gain hp
i thought the game would see the addmaxheart and go "haha. no."
let me rephrase that
And no, that's what parameters are for ?
Yeah it is
i was afraid that boolean was gonna throw a fit if i set it to true
neat
it's that easy?
And you can give him extra hearts with the `EntityPlayer::AddMaxHearts()` function and the boolean `ignoreKeeper` set to true
I have Keeper unlocked yes
(i also don't know how to farm greed mode for him very efficently)
i need to test if i can give keeper another coin heart, but i don't have him unlocked.
so does anyone have keeper unlocked and a lot of time to spare?
More like have nightmares
eh, a man can dream :^)
And that's probably not possible without rewriting the entire AI
Let's not
someone should make a mod that adds a champion bloat who can shoot up
the insight is appreciated haha, i'm still improving at this
It's like the "trust me, I'm an engineer" bit but with much more laziness put in it haha
Trust me, I'm a programmer ?
good point
Which means that the second it breaks, everything's fucked
The "find out why this works" is much worse ; it means that not only you don't understand it, but on top of that you probably won't get back to it because it works
Oh no, the "find out why this doesn't work" is fine, it just means that you have to fix it
aka the problem i'm having with FireDelay
hahaha at least it's not "find out why this doesn't work"
Also when you start running into comments that go `-- TODO : find out why this works`
Then yeah, some of it can be called magic
Except when you start dealing with functions that are over 300 lines long
There's no magic in programming
No problem haha
thank you haha
There you go
oh, i'm seeing the difference now, i accidentally used an array, now everything makes sense
Maybe somewhere at top level he wrote `local blah = items.blah`
I mean, the "blah" bit
mine stores it as global too, since that item's refernced in multiple functions
Can't really see how that would work anyhow else
Maybe he stored it in a global value before
bit weird that it works fine with just player:AddCollectible(blah, 0, false) in another mod i looked at, but in mine it only accepts it if i do player:AddCollectible(items.blah, 0, false)
Haha I knew it
yeah, the item works great from pedestals
wait nvm, there is something in the log this time
Even when picking up an actual item from item pedestals ?
Welp
there's nothing in the log, i did that
My only relevant answer is "check the log"
even the costume works fine, as long as i give it before the item
i've messed with it dozens of times now and it's driving me bonkers
could someone please fill me in on why, when sent a player:AddCollectible for my working modded item, my new character startup just up and refuses to grant the item or anything further awfter that?
¯\_(?)_/¯
Got it
And yes please
The dude even says it
"**NOTE!** These fields are not saved in the C++ side, which means that if you pass the object to a function from C++ that creates a new object based on the values of the first object, the field is going to be reset to default."
¯\_(?)_/¯
next time I'll read the page
well shit
hang on
ik but this is
What this framework does is called lazy values initialization
Code injection is when you take code that was written outside of a program, and execute it inside that program
No, it's really not
?
b-but its a code injection framework
And no
You didn't even look at the thing
Dude
Are we gonna be able to add stages with this...?
yeah I saw that. pretty cool
lets you extend the API
https://gitlab.com/Zatherz/abpp
It's actually pretty cool
Y'all checked out Zatherz's thing he made
thanks
ok
just outside of the afterbirth+ mods folder is an afterbirth+ folder, its in there
but where do i find the log file
this is probably very stupid
That too haha
thanks for the suggestions! I don't think it'll solve the cystiniosis conflict but it'll certainly make things operate a lot smoother ^^
ok
i wish i had a more specific answer, but it seems largely to be if you can move with isaac it's being called
once after each game update that excluding cutscenes and such
when exactly is POST_UPDATE called?
That's the most basic of optimisation tasks you could make
yea no not as big as calling evaluatecache every frame
you're trading 1 number for potentially a lot of performance
So ? ?
that would require saving previous total but I suppose that's fair
evaluate cache is _usually_ only called when it's necessary, on damage, on item pickup
That too
you could also only call add cache and evaluate when there was actually a change in the total
Yeah my question was, is EvaluateCache called every frame
although we might only need AddCacheFlags now that i think about it
thats exactly how this example works, it adds luck based on less coins.
if cacheevaluations wasn't exposed it wouldn't allow you to do things like taurus or money = power since evaluatecache wouldn't be called every frame or on coin pickup in normal circumstances
i believe we do, we can't have just the cache evaluation
oke ill try
Not yourself anyway
haven't tested it
So I'm thinking that you shouldn't have to call it every time, right ?
Just like Update or Render
Because the cache evaluation is part of the game loop anyway
<@!135254843567767552> do you know if EntityRef.Entity.Index works ?
here's an example, it needs to be operated every frame as long as you have the item
Try removing the cache request and see if it still works ?
```
local function applyBeggarsCupStatUpdate(player)
    if player:HasCollectible(BEGGARS_CUP_ITEM) then
        local keys = player:GetNumKeys()
        local coins = player:GetNumCoins() * 2
        local bombs = player:GetNumBombs()
        local total = (keys + coins + bombs) / 4

        local luck_threshold = 10

        luck_modifier = luck_threshold - total

        player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_LUCK)
        player:EvaluateItems()
    end
end
```
Well I mean it'll be called anyway
we have a function called on peffect, which calculates what stat changes need to be made, then requests a cache evaluation
I feel like player:EvaluateCache() shouldn't have been exposed
And why ?
When do you use that ?
and they are, we use player:EvaluateCache(), which causes the game to call MC_EVALUATE_CACHE again.
haven't found any other bugs yet, which is surprising because i have more than 10 mods on right now
If you don't respect that, your situation happens
That's what they're for
All stats updates should be in the MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback
ah ok ^^
Yeah but even so
cystiniosis and patience from the alphabirth mod
it is, the peffects has a call to reevaluate
What is it doing in the peffects
I mean the two items
Your thing should be in MC_EVALUATE_CACHE anyway
<@108717851623374848> two? what was the other bug?
MC_PLAYER_EFFECT is not a thing
sure, ?
You mean MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE ?
we're evaluating damage using MC_PLAYER_EFFECT, Cystiniosis is modifying tear delay
That way it'll only get evaluated once per frame
<@149531072164528128> to counteract the infinite reevaluation, you should hold a flag that gets set when the tear delay is updated and reset on POST_RENDER
I'd recommend changing teardelay in the TEARCOLOR cache or something since that one should never need to be updated frequently
yeah, tear delay started growing exponentially when I was in a room with enemies
hmm. interesting
<@109624258317033472> one of our items constantly evaluates the damage cache and thus Cystiniosis was going berserk with teardelay
did you see the bug I was having with the two items Scayze?
It's limited af lol
you can always go back and change things later, even if something is "done"
<@266032468853915650> ehh wat? ?
its just not up to snuff for what people want to do with it
its done
Sheesh they released the main point of the dlc and it ain't done yet
so I managed to find the world's worst unintentional synergy
Not nearly done
it's most likely a workaround since CACHE_FIREDELAY is currently broken
Yeah Nicalis are still working on the API
<@149531072164528128>  you're late
well thats interesting
Hopefully they get more updates since they're quite limited atm
Well that sucks.
No new floors
The issue is that in the Cystinosis mod, tear delay is being modified in the damage cache, and our item is constantly evaluating the damage cache <@109624258317033472> <@108717851623374848>
<@181118496199933952> nope
He has modded a lot of things iirc
oh alright
he's the creator of Cystinosis
Have the modding tools been updated to make new floors yet?
but <@109624258317033472> is here
I have no idea then
that really doesn't help
Haha nah
:v
listen to mat he's smarter than me
<@266032468853915650> dunno if this will help or not http://prntscr.com/dzxsmg
Detect when the player enters the room, save their health, detect when the room is cleared, test against the current health, do your thing
ideally that should work, i think
if [at the start of next room, idk the proper code for it] and player.GetHearts() [whatever you wanna do with it] then
?
<@170676832054542337> player.GetHearts()
damnit
thanks. thats what i guessed
such as that GetData function yes
how would you go about telling if you have less health at the end of the room than you did at the start
from my experience the Entity given from EntityRef is not the same as a normal Entity at least in that it's missing some information
Hahaha
yeah. in the damage callback the Damage source is an entity ref
I think I might unsubscribe from the plagues of egypt mod... http://prntscr.com/dzxr4p
source is a EntityRef ?
yeah, but EntityRef.Entity is basicly the entity, idnt it?
You do know EntityRef is not the same as Entity right ?
source.Entity doesn't have the method GetData
...
code is ```if source.Entity:GetData().Type ==1  then```
[INFO] - [ImaginaryFriend] Error in PreEntityTakeDamage call: ...ding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/imaginaryfriends/main.lua:221: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetData')
well. im trying to use it in combination with GetData in the damage callback. but there always comes one error up:
? I used it before and it worked just fine
could it be that EntityRef is bugged?
there's a log.txt in there
My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+
how to see log?
which you could see in the log, i'm not sure if that's still there or not, may not even be relevant
i do know that when i first subscribed to cystinosis they had a syntax error in the code
Weird
it doesn't
See if picking up that item alone fucks it up
API isn't much help
teardelay is kinda weird to modify right now
I have no idea how this would even happen but that item gives a tear delay up when you collect it so it must be screwy that way
hmm thanks for doing some debuging for us. it actually helps alot
which is an item added in another mod
this bug happens when I have Patience and Cystinosis
aha I see
:/
It may have been some goofy synergy with another mod's item
hm alright I just spawned it in and it seems to be working ok
if you want to test it in another run
if you dont have any other item mods on, the id for patience should be c533
Which is a shame, it shouldn't be possible
I know that, but it's possible to provide your own ID
Okay so I see it's not you haha
all of your items are dynamically assigned
Or maybe KyoZM is the idiot that did that haha
Maybe an item stupidly hardcoded its own ID into the game and so happened to be the one that was assigned to Patience
im going to run a few more tests after the run to see what may have caused it
yeah I do
got any other mods on?
it is bringing my damage up but once I collected it it started making my tear delay increase exponentially
<@108717851623374848> i don't think it had to do with that item, that's patience. it's only supposed to affect damage
and the items
currently just the costumes2.xml
i have lua for it but its commented out
<@90940715076423680> how are you using it ? Any Lua going on ?
that's pretty funny lol
even though it animates in the animation editor
ingame
my anm2 isn't *animating*
thats odd..
Admittedly
That's a lot
it brought my tear delay up to ten billion
what's up
yes
is this one of your items? http://prntscr.com/dzxkjw
?
:D
i just had my path messed up in my anm2 file
thank you so much <@116386733905412105>
holy shit
<@108717851623374848> ^
this might actually be fixed
so since i moved it, it didn't know what to use for the costume
<@266032468853915650> bug report for your mod
you just clued me into the fact that .anm2 files keep the place of the png
oh wait
that means there's something wrong with your costume's definition or anm2 file or png or whatever
my guess is alphabirth?
I dont know what mod added it, but it's an item called Patience
if manually adding it doesn't work
Let me try
Hmm
<@108717851623374848> what item is that ?
I think EntityPlayer has an addcostume method
have you tried applying your costume manually?
but I still can't shoot
just isn't working
this item seems like super bugged, it went up to around 10 billion tear delay and then dropped me down to 1
i did both those
you can tell it which costume you want associated with the item
either costumes2 or items.xml
Unsigned numbers galore
i have the costumes2 ande all that
what in god's name is happening http://prntscr.com/dzxi15
just doesn't show up
mhm
do someone know if TryBlowOpen() works on doors at the Chest ?
does it just not show up?
but i can't figure it out
i'm trying to get a costume to work on isaac's body when i pickup my item
what kinds of costumes?
I know many things but haven't applied any
I need to do more mods
Nope
hey mat, have you gotten any costumes to work?
I mean you've got a bunch in <#267353315073982465>
Yep
artists are so few and far between -_-
Hence why I'm in a indie team with artists in it
I can code anything and can't draw nothing
Maddogs I feel you, I'm the same
kek
oh yeah I forgot that existed
Checked the log?
hey man, I'd love to help
hmm
what do ?
I can code a complex character in 24 hours, but can't sprite it in 24 ?
when it dies the game crashes
I made a new enemy varient
Came to ask though
only good for coding
i'm still a skrub
I'm relativly new
i wish I was as good at spriting as you, or had someone who could help :v
afaik
but none of them have that sick melting animation
ik ;p
I made this for someone else but Im not sure if they went through w/ it
?
cos there's like 3-4 delirium character mods out there
i dont know
yeah
Is that already published?
delirium style  character eh? ?
what do you think
yeah?
she's limited to only black hearts though Prismuth
hey maddogs
my ideas are gonna get crazier and crazier
black hearts are supposed to be rare
XD
Damn Maddogs you really got your character game going
on an average run I ended on about 400ish
set it to 50
800 is unlikely
and there are tons of enemies
yeah, not sure about that value
if you have 800
12 or a black heart
damage*0.01, range*0.1, and 12 for a sin heart
damage?
what scales with souls?
she also combos with brim/tech etc to make the familiars shoot lasers/brim
Sounds op
Huh
and shoot at the target
and they also move to the target
Siren 2.0
she also charms enemies if theyre near
It's like
So much fun to play
^_^
looks really cool!
yeah, debugtext
Idk how to make the font change
is it just debugtext?
bottom left
Where's the soul gauge
Yeah, the incubus aren't done yet
WH
nah, that's her at 800 souls
you should probably get a better animation
As she gains souls, she gets damage and range, plus can gain health or spawn familiars
And those incubi things are souls?
She absorbs enemies that enter her aura for too long, and turns them into souls
woah

New character almost ready for release ?
bc someone thought it was good enough to be good enough to steal
Read my comment :P
Well, on the bright side, be honored
I flagged it
Takedown notice yo
TFW you find out somebody stole your mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838926805&searchtext=item http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837193742
Oh sorry haha
"Most popular items in the last week"
It's chronological haha

my mod got on the scroll thing
w0ah
community made libraries etc
this opens up possibilities for so much
better than nothing
so what does it just append your files
? https://github.com/baskervald/modrequire
?
I just had my most powerful run of all time and none of it counted because I forgot to disable a mod
holy fucking shit
is there a way to get the item for goat head?
it was expecting an item
and it was expecting something else
cya
seems like you passed the id of your item
bye
idk
uh
```Error in PostUpdate call: ...Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/abpack2/main.lua:268: bad argument #1 to 'RemoveCostume' (Item expected, got number)```
``RemoveCostume(Config::Item Item)``
anyone know how to remove a costume while keeping the item effects?
ok... i guess i need to waste another 100K hours to figure how to do that...
just make a subgroup of an entity
only if you enter the room for the first time
i know how to do that
its 1/10
oh
i don't think so
no
what?
so, this will work if i visit the room for the first time?
something like that maybe
```if entity.FrameCount <= 5 then
            local chance = math.random(1,10)
            if chance == 1 then
                blarhblah = entity:ToNPC()
                if blarhblah then
                    Entity:Morph(EntityType.ENTITY_CHEST,
                        3,
                        0,
                        0)
                end
            end
        end```
i am trying to replace the chests with another chests with chance of 1/10, only if i enter the room for the first time
im weirdorino
```math.randomseed(Random())
math.random();math.random();math.random();```
idk it's just how I've always done it, might be redundant
Entities
Why set that up
Wat
Set up a mathrandom rng first
Depends on what you want
how to do something for entities when you enter room first time(I tried all)?
<:isaac_tongue:245063314906808320>
that's some good shit

!items
I hope they are
Nicalis are still working hard on it (supposedly)
Keep in mind the API is not in its definitive state
Yeah they could
they could do that
well how about custom unlocks only
If achievements were accessible through mods, you could just cheat and make a mod that unlocks everything and you get all Steam achievements etc
what do  u mean
Yeah
spoiling the players?
I don't know about that unfortunately
only replace right
<@207634020354359296> that's to prevent mods from spoiling the players
and u cant add floors either?
hoping that'll be added, along with ability to affect floor generation more
i hate how limited api is
<@126147229030285312> I'm sure there is
that sucks
<@207634020354359296> absolutely no way right now
is there absolutely NO way to add unlocks with ab+ ap
does anyone know how it's possible to check the player's character? i have an item that's utterly broken if you're the lost or blue baby, and need to give it a case to have slightly different function with them
Try it with some different items to see if that's the case
As I said, because some items start working when you enter a room with them, it might not be possible to do that with The Soul
I have no idea really
so, what could be the solution?
Yeah obviously that won't work
as you said, probably count is for another thing
but it doesn't seem to be the way
I'm trying this:
`player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SOUL,true)
    player:GetEffects():GetCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SOUL).Count=1`
But beware, this will mean your code will trigger for every frame the shoot button is held down
<@146600389779783680> then look into `ActionTriggers`
Since it's retrieving it from the `TemporaryEffects` object
rather the shoot button, lets give lilith some love
<@126369664170328064> that will only work if the player has the effect active
Which do you want ?
If the player is holding the shoot button, or if a tear has been spawned
<@146600389779783680> that can mean two things
ugh how can u detect whether isaac is shooting?
so, I'm trying to use `player:GetEffects():GetCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SOUL)`
No problem
ok tkhs
And you should look into the `MC_USE_CARD` callback, as well as the `Isaac.Spawn` function
yes
You'll have to use Lua for that
yes
So you want to make a custom card that spawns a quarter ?
What is the command to spawn the quarter, after activating a card?
<@268073737142665218> you didn't ask anything yet
oh, ok
I think `Count` is just the index of the effect in the array of effects that is the `TemporaryEffects` object
i need help fo one command, one can help me please??
Not `TemporaryEffects`, which is what `EntityPlayer` exposes
Heeeeh it's `TemporaryEffect` that has a Count attribute
Let me see
to a higher number
that's why I think I need to manually set the public attribute "Count"
Yeah I figured
I've tried many times
Maybe you're just stumbling upon the cases where it's not really powerful ?
Well The Soul has this thing when the deflecting power depends on the intensity of the aura I believe
I see
but the tears don't get deflected
Damn Robo Baby chill out
I get the blue aura
it gives me the effect
yes
Oh so you're doing that upon taking damage ?
but I have to use an MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
It takes an EntityPlayer as a parameter
ok
And then apply your trinket effect there
If you're not doing it already, try using the MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE callback
but it'd also give me soul hearts, which I don't want
becuase, if I use "g soul", giving myself the soul, it works
I guessed it has to do with that Count public attribute
I'm assuming you activate your effect upon entering a new room ?
hmm
for a room
because I want to make a trinket that, in some cases, gives you the soul effect
Don't know about The Soul, but it now looks like it
Like Holy Mantle for example
oh, weird
<@126369664170328064> most items are activated upon entering a room, not upon pickup
lol
I forgot to add .png on the end
nvm im stupid
I use it, and it gives me the blue aura, but it doesn't reflect things
for some reason my items decided to not appear on pedestals anymore, xD
because using ` player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SOUL,true)` sort of works
ugghhh
I doubt it <@223869207748542464>
has anyone messed with 
AddCollectibleEffect to add the soul?
is there a way to manually set room first visit to false?
Hahaha
need to look in the logs more often...
i'm just dumb
nvm
oh
anyone?
But it doesn't work
i'm trying to do ``if player:HasTrinket(TRINKET) and math.random(1, 2) == 2 and Game:GetRoom():IsFirstVisit() then``
how does it works?
guys, i am a bit confused with ``Room:IsFirstVisit()``
bye
Good luck with that
Bai
have a good day everyone
thanks, it seems I need some Wine trickery to install Antibirth.
whoops, my bad
Read again x)
or rather buy
so for Antibirth I'd need to install afterbirth+?
The process is the same as for Windows, except for a couple paths that change (they should look alike anyway)
You're probably better off trying them out anyway
darn, and cool.
Apart from that, yes you can mix mods no problem as long as the mods themselves account for the possibility of coexisting with other mods
For instance Antibirth is Rebirth- and Windows-only
Also, is it possible to mix mods such as a large mod like Antibirth, and a small one-item mod?
Is it possible to install mods for linux users? I am using specifically Linux Mint 17.
ok
And check if it's a player
MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE
There's a callback for that
how to detect when player is hurt by anything?
I never went back to it
But yeah good point I'll just remove that
<@112975821186031616> good question xD that's the first and only mod I ever wrote, and I wrote it before I knew anything about the API
What this code does is send between 2 and 4 Red Candle fires, adding to the player's velocity, randomly spread in a 60° wide cone around where the player is looking
Why would you need to test if the effect is chiliPillId if you use chiliPillId in your callback?
14.0 is the base velocity of Red Candle fires
And use some sort of stat instead
You probably want to change the 14.0 too
yeye
And also the callback obviously, since that one triggers when you eat a certain pill
Yeah, you would just have to change the `Isaac.Spawn` line to fire tears instead of Red Candle flames
would this also work for custom tears?
I removed a couple lines that were leftover from past debugging
That's not a question x)
**everything**
If you have questions, I'm here
thats a bit complicated....
Yeah there are a couple tricks in it right haha
*mindsplosivo*
```Lua
local chiliPill = RegisterMod("RedHotChiliPill", 1)
local chiliPillId = Isaac.GetPillEffectByName("Red Hot Chili")

function chiliPill:use(effect)
    if effect == chiliPillId then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local dir = player:GetHeadDirection()
        local vel = player:GetVelocityBeforeUpdate()
        local additionalVel = Vector(0.0, 0.0)
        additionalVel.X = (dir == Direction.RIGHT and 1 or 0) - (dir == Direction.LEFT and 1 or 0)
        additionalVel.Y = (dir == Direction.DOWN and 1 or 0) - (dir == Direction.UP and 1 or 0)
        additionalVel = additionalVel * 14.0 -- base velocity of red candle flames
        for i = 0, ((Random() % 3) + 2) do
            Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.RED_CANDLE_FLAME, EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, player.Position, vel + additionalVel:Rotated((Random() % 60) - 30), player)
        end
    end
end

chiliPill:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_PILL, chiliPill.use, chiliPillId)
```
I mean you can take a look at it and see if it inspires you.
I'm guessing the fonts are hand-painted.
I dont think that's that code I need
does anyone know what font the game uses for the little achievement paper things that show up when you unlocked something ?
I can post the code here if you want
now I need to remember how I did the triple shot in terraria and somehow translate C# to Lua
I did a mod that adds a pill called "Red Hot Chili" which basically is a one-shot, Red Candle-type Monstro's Lung burst
oh god
That's just manipulation of the Velocity argument in `Isaac.Spawn`
Its like 5 Tears in a bow shape
I'd look for other mods that do similar and see how they did it.
I don't know about the burst part of it being super common, which I'm guessing is the part they're stuck on.
well its one of the rather easiest items to make >.>
That sounds like a common use for a mod
There will definitely be a video for that
That's easy to do
Chance to shoot out a burst of custom tears which inflict charm, the chance depends on the luck stat
What are you looking to do?
I dont think there is a video to do this
Plenty of useful video tutorials out there
I wish I had some sorts of idea how to make this item
Here's the stats for my first workshop mod.
oh look its my mod case
Nice haha
Here's the stats for my first workshop mod.
hmm, i'll take a look
<@266032468853915650> see the doc for the Level class ; there's at least a `AddAngelRoomChance` method and a `GetDevilAngelRoomRNG`
I remember seeing some things
<@266032468853915650> I think there is a way

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849134242
Anyone know how to mess with devil room chances?
Link?
lol
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837193742
mine is a shitpost mod
Brimstone Bombs
and what type of mod is it?
So it was easier back then
That one got in early
<@!210897422187102208> http://i.imgur.com/HQJecQy.png And this is my first workshop mod after 17 days
whats your full code look like?
<@68232539621298176>  i've just tried adapting your function, but I'm still failing at it.  What might I be doing wrong?
ok
don't have a link for one sorry
<@160893636232347648> link me mod for rebirth plz
pretty sure you're downloading mods for afterbirth or afterbirth +

i can dowload it but when try to run isaac rebirth the mod is not there
i cant download things from the worshop or the website help me guys
their removal from the normal rooms can only be a good thing right ?
and since walking hosts are a pain in the ass
(can't actually make new bosses since i don't use ab+ so i need to replace existing enemies with them)
i was thinking of making a boss based on the walking host enemy
1 sec
nice idea
Whenever you select the glitch, instead of having it fade to black, have it do a glitch effect maybe?
reverse the whole background etc.
change the difficulty paper
like
what if i edit the whole menu when you select the Glitch
ooo
Welp, time to make more terrible treasure rooms
ah ok
with the missingno item
the random is just behind Silas
i may replace eden with one in Overcharged
no
It seems like it replaces random character
could be a cool idea
yes
glitch character eh ?
Cute
http://puu.sh/tyoKA/8adaab0629.jpg
it almost has 10 subs
hey
shitpost mods won't get you anything
and is that a shitpost mod? no, I didn't think so
now THAT is a good conversion rate
plebs https://i.gyazo.com/7b22d5db1c7a449b90dfa3b822c92bee.png
I remember seeing it somewhere, but I can't find it in the documentation :/
Hi, does anyone remember how to check if given item is passive or active?
yay
k i found out
sax's conversion is excellent

wtf with these intros outros loops and idk tf in the music folder ?
or at least is planned to be
that's what is Overcharged
room overhaul, new bosses
¯\_(?)_/¯
i only put it in here and my private friends discord
i dont even know how 100+ people found my mod
t
dammi
http://puu.sh/tylBJ/1197ef967e.jpg
like whats it gonna be
whats overcharged?
All of it
MoI, Reddit, Steam

Put it everywhere yo
if i ever get Overcharged done, i'll probably just post it on the modding of isaac site or reddit
>when you have $37 to spend
so im happy :)
its doing well though
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-24_12-47-49.png
lol
but i had to pay 37$ to upload my mod lol
i had the game through family sharing through bf
how did you test it
:P
i made a mod without even owning the game
^
Well, I mean you *can* make them. You don't actually *need* any tools from AB+ to create mods for it. It'd just be rather difficult to use/upload.
it was just my idea
i don't wanna release it though because loli made it basicially
don't have ab+
can't
i have one you can add
Maybe your mod should just add some more holy-themed items, <@160893636232347648>.
there's really not a lot compared to devil/evil themed items
this is why i wish there was more angel/holy themed items
Most of that just seems like it'd be weird to find in an Angel Room.
i could also increase the weight of the stronger angel items  (Godhead, Mind/Body/Soul, Sacred Heart....)
oh
BREAKFAST!
and....
holy light is already there
BLANK CARD, D100, 20/20, BOOK OF SHADOWS, HOLY LIGHT!, CROWN OF LIGHT
i'm trying to buff the angel room, what items could i add to the angel room item pool ?
using achievements
you can try to lock them
but
i think this is impossible...
<@112975821186031616> uh
hi
~~where do i find the log file~~
ayyeverybody
What do you use for that, I wonder?
you can remove them when player picks them
Huh, no way to actually remove pills/cards/etc. What a strange oversight.
check your log and your players.xml
what did i do
and now they both have base isaac stats
i tried to edit the second one's stats
but i added another one
everything worked fine
so I added a character and changed his stats
Isn't everything?
also very hacky and not a great option.
That sounds like it could work
yey
http://puu.sh/tyizW/8af72cdb88.jpg
give them an item that makes it so they can't hold pills then take it away the next frame?
Maybe adding a null pill or something
Anyone know if it's possible to remove a pill in Lua?
I know Player:AddPill is a working command
this is good
for the first time, I got an error

yeah, considering it's nintendo of all things
I'd still be concerned about the legal side, though.
Ah, in that case it might be fine, then.
mod works fine btw
just replaceing the original sound files with my edited ones
Is this a vanilla-modifying thing or are the sounds for expanded items?
Probably not for just the sounds.
That might work, something like the modding of isaac website a good place to upload?
I'd suggest uploading the sounds to a third party website and linking them in the mod's description while making them optional in the mod itself.
try an empty folder with just metadata.xml
could be worth splitting them
most mods are like less than 100kb so you might be an edge case here
there may even be a limit that they aren't mentioning that you're running into and they have no error in place for it, i'm not sure
Might want to be careful about uploading it if you're using official sound assets, by the way.
I left it 6 hours to upload today, still on 10% however
my assumption is that it's just taking a long time to upload
Yikes. That is very big for a BoI mod.
that is quite large ?
Mod is 157 Mb, so kinda large, Ill try just the music then, good idea
assuming your mod is sound heavy and rather large, have you tried to upload the mod without the sounds?
Haha ok then nevermind ? I've honestly tried as much as I can think off... apart from running the moduploader from a terminal, not sure how to do that
As long as it's not about the uploading thing. I never uploaded a mod.
no worries ? hey <@112975821186031616>, you seem like you some things about modding, could I ask some help with an issue I've got?
i don't know, sorry :/
the goal is to kill enemies before they can get to you
i gave him 3 red hearts and a soul heart
yeah
Sounds like he'd be pretty prone to taking damage, though.
<@229593818691928067>  still at 10%
that's pretty fun
i also gave him ludo to start out
<@229593818691928067>  no luck...
it's an interesting playstyle
How's that working out?
like 7.5 damage to start
so i've been messing around with a character that has sorta high health, miniscule speed, but immense damage
we can try together sometime
oh okay, I still need to figure that out but it's something I'll eventually want to do
Yeah.
this thing you mean?
The back, I think.
you mean the back or the front?
ahh, ok
By the way, if you ever manage to change a card's texture in-world that doesn't involve manually replacing their sprite, please tell me how.
what?
I'll have to get work on actually make the rng spawn the cards but that's a whole new story hahah
Willy afaik if it's pocketitems.xml it should appear
Nice, good job.
No, I actually managed to fix everything atm!
I'm back. Still having problems, <@141237286162530304>?
thx xD
you :p
xD
or this other dude
who me?
and upload again
try deleting metadata.xml
or I have to use a specific command?
if i have program one card, when I put the mod on the game the card spawn normally in game during a run?
and I see what you mean about the terminal

Only after encountering the error
i meant from a terminal typing "moduploader" to run it
have you edited the metadata manually ?
Or the Metadata?
HMmm I'm afriad I am not 100% sure what you mean, sorry! are you asking me to open the "mod uploader" tool in notepad?
can you run it from a terminal and show me the output
It only restarts the build up back to 10%
I have
have you tried restarting Steam

But I've been troubleshooting this problem all day, and had no luck
This will be my first workshop submission just to add, so I'm fairly new to this
Hey guys, I have a problem with a mod I'm trying to upload.. using the uploader tool its stuck on 10%, anyone know what I can do about this?
lol
Mom's Sacred Halo of Brain
Gonna try and optimize what I can though
you can only take 1 though
and when you blow it up it spawns a bunch of items from a specific item pool
that's like, a bird bath
hmmm a room type for the super secret room
Lmao probably not
can isaac handle it? <@110125570452398080>
ah, gotcha
Take the isaac randomizer pool for example, it makes for some amazing item names
I'm working on it, I mostly just want to get it to work before I get too in depth with it
It would be way better if it took names from a pool that's not just isaac names
I'm making a 700,000 items mod, and my random name generator is giving me some A+ material
Yeah, I guess they pushed search to stable
in: <#205854782542315520>
Or just a generic search thingy?
Is it a dedicated search feature
When you ctrl+F
Just to be sure
sure ain't
Is your taskbar icon yellow?
I don't think I'm betaing
I mean the beta
When I say canary
EatMeReturns - Today at 11:02 AM
might be desktop app only tho
Wait, can you ctrl+F the chat outside of canary now?
I Think he told you the alternative
like i need to change the way I use that getcard right?
is there any other way other than that though
uh I think he told you to use a different variable
i'm kinda confused by that tbh
might be desktop app only tho
so wait, do I need to give each card a value in the getcard?
cool
you can ctrl+F the chat history
aaah i missed that
Alzarath - Today at 10:09 AM
You might not have problems with the GetCardIdByName thing with just one card, but without it using the proper value, they return a -1, so having multiple cards means they'll all activate when any USE_CARD callback is triggered.
is there some kind of bug atm of them just simultaneously activating or did I code wrong? talking about two cards ofc
lol
ok what did you guys say about multiple cards activating
thanks a lot guys!
yay
wieeeeeeeeeeeerd
and now it does work
well i removed the gfx
does the function callback go off?
but using the card just does nothing ingame
no, the sprite is there
sprite not appearing?
what's the issue?
wait so
thanks for the time man, really appreciate it
Anyways, try skimming all of that stuff out of there and see what happens. I gotta go. Hope you manage to get it working.
i dont think it should mess with it that much I believe
it's just left there from me goofing around
yeah exactly
but tbh im not sure if its really needed since i did it with the animation editor after it
The hud value should be doing that.
it's basically because the sprite of a card is actually an animation with a single frame, so that points to the file it needs for sprites
Why's there a hyphen with the `-<pocketitems>`? Also the `<?xml version="1.0"?>` isn't needed. Dunno if that'd cause any issues. Does `gfx` do anything in pocketitems? I'm not aware that it does.
the other stuff you can just ignore i think
```<?xml version="1.0"?>

-<pocketitems>

<card gfx="Cards.png" description="Item multiplier x3" hud="3ofDiamonds" name="3 of Diamonds"/>

<card gfx="Cards.png" description="Item multiplier x3" hud="3ofHearts" name="3 of Hearts"/>

<card gfx="Cards.png" description="Item multiplier x3" hud="3ofSpades" name="3 of Spades"/>

<card gfx="Cards.png" description="Item multiplier x3" hud="3ofClubs" name="3 of Clubs"/>

</pocketitems>
 ```
(3 graves (\`) makes a nicer code block, btw)
Post what's in your pocketitems.xml
Well, this is my main.lua, if it helps somehow:

```lua
local MoreCards = RegisterMod("More Playing Cards",1)
local ThreeofDiamonds = Isaac.GetCardIdByName("3OfDiamonds")

function MoreCards:useThreeofDiamonds()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:GetNumCoins() == 0 then
        player:AddCoins(3);

    end
end

MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MoreCards.CacheUpdate)
MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_CARD, MoreCards.useThreeofDiamonds, ThreeofDiamonds)```
I did change both
wait but he changed the header of the function right?
but I can't really think what that could be
I'm starting to suspect I have something wrong outside the main file
yeah exactly
I guess.
Probably just doing trial and error.
Why was it changed, then?
He did initially have that.
use MoreCards.useThreeofDiamonds instead
in your AddCallback for the useThreeofDiamonds, you have MoreCards:useThreeofDiamonds
I suspect the issue is in your `pocketitems.xml`, since I've been having trouble getting it to *not* work.
Yeah, it still does nothing at all
Probably not, no.
I'll try deleting but I'm not sure if that's making a difference really
It's just a variable it sets from the callback. To be honest you shouldn't even need anything in there.
The parameter you're passing to the function should not be the ID.
that's the code I'm using atm
Oh wait, I didn't even change the `.` to a `:`. Why does that even work?
`local MoreCards = RegisterMod("More Playing Cards",1)
local ThreeofDiamonds = Isaac.GetCardIdByName("3ofDiamonds")

function MoreCards:useThreeofDiamonds(52)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:GetNumCoins() == 0 then
        player:AddCoins(3);
        end
    end

MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MoreCards.CacheUpdate)
MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_CARD, MoreCards:useThreeofDiamonds, ThreeofDiamonds)`
No, changing it back didn't affect it.
yeah it's using the hud value
Did you try changing the GetCardIdByName thing to the hud value? I did that, but I'm not sure it'd make a difference.
but still when I use the card the coins aren't added
yeah I did change that too
After adjusting the `.` to a `:`, of course.
that's wierd
Actually, the code you gave works perfectly fine for me.
I think something's wrong in the use callback
yeah, the log just sees the use card trigger without doing anything else
ah okay, thanks
Check the pinned message
<@141237286162530304> use the formatting syntax for your code
yeah definitely check your log
Tip: Use `Isaac.DebugString()` to see what something is returning.
it still does nothing ingame though
Assuming the game hasn't updated to fix that as of a few days ago, of course.
You might not have problems with the GetCardIdByName thing with just one card, but without it using the proper value, they return a `-1`, so having multiple cards means they'll all activate when any USE_CARD callback is triggered.
No it very much mattere
Also the (cardid) i think
shouldn't matter though since it's the callback name I think
oooh the :
I'll check that right away, but the sprite in the game does work, it's just that the card doesn't do anything
Oh yeah, that too.
function MoreCards:useThreeofDiamonds?
Not sure what problem you're having, but... `GetCardIdByName` actually gets a card's `hud` value, for some reason. Try using that instead, if you're not already.
i just remove (cardId)?
function MoreCards.useThreeofDiamonds
in my head this should work
local MoreCards = RegisterMod("More Playing Cards",1)
local ThreeofDiamonds = Isaac.GetCardIdByName("3 of Diamonds")
function MoreCards.useThreeofDiamonds(cardId)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:GetNumCoins() == 0 then
        player:AddCoins(3);

        end
    end

MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MoreCards.CacheUpdate)
MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_CARD, MoreCards.useThreeofDiamonds, ThreeofDiamonds)
still trying to get my head around that thing from yesterday
kay so noob guy is back lol
More like an in-between episode
Haha sorta
a spiritual sequal to vvvvvv?
It was our first game as a team so it was great
We were very happy about it
Thanks ^^
Still impressive
right, lol, my bad
It was a discrete little game jam somebody made
I though ludum dare had an elevator theme
No not the Ludum Dare hahaha
Damn
You won the ludum dare game jam?
Or you just compile it to JavaScript and you write a stupid index.html file that includes it and there you go, you've got your HTML5 application
What it does is translate the Haxe source code into C++ and compile the C++ with a project called HXCPP
For example, you can compile to a native executable
but alas
if flash isaac was actionscript 3 i'd port it to haxe and compile to c++
Yep
I'm not a professional, what's it mean to compile to other languages? Does it just translate its own language to another that can be compiled?
You can compile Haxe as many, maaaany languages and/or platforms
But yeah, its main strength is that it has so many compile targets
Not in performance
In syntax that is haha
I'll take a look, though.
I don't think anything should be compared to Java if you don't want a bad first impression.
Object-oriented, strictly typed
It looks a lot like Java with some elements of OCaML and some of its own
IMO it's great, as I said before haha
Hopefully `require` will be re-enabled in the future. How is Haxe anyways? I keep hearing it mentioned but haven't noticed any real opinions.
I use Skype, Discord, FB and Hangouts for different purposes
Depends
what platform do the 4 of you use for communication
It probably won't work since `require` is busted
Ooooh yeah haha
Kappa
haxe api for isaac when
Haxe compiles to Lua too haha
Yeah it's great
haxe compiles to everything
excellent
<@116386733905412105> Haxe can compile to Flash, which is what we did to have a press-to-play function
and compile it to an actual good language
Yep
the f on play looks like the flash symbol
if only flash isaac was actionscript 3, then you could port it to haxe easily
Oh it's great, at least I think it is
i've heard of haxe but never used it
And that is us : https://twitter.com/TeamIdeaBomb
Nope, the first one is Haxe, the other one is C++
is this in flash
That's my own personal game : http://gamejolt.com/games/nkaruga/92026
The theme was elevators
That's the game jam-winning one
http://gamejolt.com/games/lifts-for-the-brainless/192906
You didn't ask haha
there's a distinct lack of links
It won a game jam, by the way
We're a team of 4 people called Idea Bomb, we made a small game before that
Very early ?
We're in the early stages right now
There will be
or just a hobby
is there a website for it
oh nice
My own game haha
what is everybody working on
My bad
Hum no wait that's how to install the API
<@112975821186031616> <@66197463593136128> API description : https://github.com/omni-/isaac-injector/wiki/Using-the-API
<@219159380094877696>
when you pickup the item from pedestal
yeah so the banners are automatically done
oh ok
no idea, don't have ab+
-_- what's the spawn code for item pedestals
dammit can't find a seed to get the item i modded
just to be sure i ain't saying wrong things
you know what ? lemme test that method i told you about
wait so there's a UI font?
it does actually IIRC
right but I don't think that automagically does the banners
unless that method is blocked by ab+
well you can add the items.xml file to your resources folder, where you mod all the item names
you could manually create the banners and draw the sprites if worst comes to worst
uh
can i code that in lua
Like when you pick up an item a banner comes saying its name and description
Anyone know how to make those 'subtitle' things appear?
i'm on mobile right now, using lightning browser which is a wrapper around android's chromium based webview so it may be a chrome issue
yeah the github.io link doesn't work for me either
I should probably report that.
That URL is considered invalid for my browser.
I mean it's now heavily outdated, but yeah
i'll take a look
http://omni-.github.io/isaac-injector/
Oh there even is a handy documentation
https://github.com/omni-/isaac-injector
Oh my bad it's Rebirth
Maybe it allowed for too few things to be done, I don't know
It provided a template for mods and everything, it looked great
Too bad it has never been used
Also, I've seen somewhere on GitHub a module to perform C++ code injection into Afterbirth
yeah
If you can write C++ for a game (which you can anyway, see Missing HUD), you can do whatever you want with it
Of course yeah
because security issues
as far as i know the plan is to not expose the c++ api
Yeah right hahaha
that was priceless
still can't get over the fact that the example ab+ api mods didn't work at launch
I mean, if it's provided, it should really work
Yeah
which is fine considering this is an internal thing
Welp haha
there was one c++ mod test dll in the files i received but it doesn't work
<it means Compiled Run Time>
<a crt0 file is what is pasted in the beginning of an executable to permit it to be runnable>
But unless you provide a crt0 file for code injection into your game, you can't have an API for compiled languages
yeah
It's always the case
Yeah I mean that's how Lua works
antibirth lua api is a wrapper around that
there is an internal c++ api
You can't have an API in C++ haha
oh
and it's lua
c++ i think
antibirth was going to have an api all along, even before ab+ was announced
What language is it ?
Daaaamn
it isn't out yet but a few of us have access to it
Since when Antibirth has an API ?
yeah
Antibirth API ?
I even have no idea how to access grid entities
i've been fucking around with the antibirth one
haven't used the ab+ api all that much
GridEntity doesn't extend Entity
?
is there a way to check for a grid entity?
then i throw it on gfycat.com
i use obs
<also plop, I'm here>
I don't use any, but I see streamable, gifycat and gyazo being used
what program do you use to record gifs/videos of your mods?
a stupid question
hey guys
probably look at azazel as an example?
Without spawning an item
How do you give flight to your character permanently?
Does anyone have the installer for antibirth
so, is there a way to check for a grid entity?
you first call the add cache function to show which flags you want to reevaluate, then you call the evaluate items
you have something like add cache and evaluate items
Can't show as I don't have access to the docs currently
There should be one under player
apart from changing the actual number
Yeah
Is there any way to force a cache update?
In the tools folder in the Isaac directory
is it some addon from ab+ or is it a tool that can be found somewhere ?
the anm2 editor
what programs must be used to open anm2 files ?
music mods take a while
Ok it's uploading now (with the different image) , it's currently not budging from 10%, do you think I should leave it then?
thanks
500x500 pixels should be fine to cover everything
not really
do you know the best dimensions for the image?
I think
24% is when you cancel and try to upload it again
Ah sweet, I'm not the only one then
24% haven't seen yet
10% happens usually to everyone
Ill change the image also
Ok I'll give it a shot, it's a large file, but it was stuck on that percentage for ages
try using another preview image
wait till its done

I would looooove some help on this c:
Hello guys? just joined, first time modder here... I have a problem... I'm using the Moduploader tool to upload my first music and sound mod, however when I click up load its stuck on 10% or 24%...
if it's your follower that fires something then you should have access to the projectile entity from the beginning
then modify it
I guess you can try to search for a laser(brimstone) entity where the parent is the lil brimstone entity
i wonder if there's a way to mod how much damage projectile using followers (i.e Lil,Brimstone) does ?
Does anyone know how to change base game sfx through a mod?
so yeah
but it's out there for anyone
I'm not great at modding myself so I thought someone else might like to take the challenge xD
idk, I may look into it
I barely know what I'm doing
Don't take my word for it
dang
aww
I dunno if you can add new consumables though
That would be really cool
¯\_(?)_/¯
I thought it might be a cool lil thing to add
Rock Heart: Can take 4 hits before depleting hence allowing more health on the character, extremely rare drop chance from blowing up rocks
shoot
Item icon is a mad catz NES controller
I got a mod idea if anyone wants to take it
If it dies it spawns as a new co-op baby skin on next floor
Mod idea: Player 2, a familiar that scales with your damage, tears, fire rare, etc, but fires on a delay and can die, uses a random co-op baby
hmm
ive been meaning to buy it on my own account anyway
so i couldn't publish my mod
i didn't technically own it
because i had it through family sharing
isaac + all its dlcs <@112975821186031616>
how do I change the sfx for certain things?
What did you spend $37 on?
thanks guys :D
don't know if it worked
trying to add this as a replacement for satan_appear.wav
that looks like a fun item, i'll be getting it
are skin-colored costumes broken? can't get mine to load properly at all
looks cool, really like the sprite
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849153461
to do this
i just spent 37$ or something like that
so uh
I feel accomplished
holy fuck
if it's set to 2, that creature gets +6 hp on caves 1
bonus HP that gets added for every floor
just out of curiousity, what *is* stage HP?
:v
it'd just be from our paychecks
i mean he lives with me
or have your bf gift it to you
guess so
better cough up the cash then
but then its not on my accountttt
get him to upload it ofc
¯\_(?)_/¯
i don't know what to do
so
yeah
through steam family sharing
?
like
my bf owns it, i play it through him
oh
?
i own it through family sharing
i don't technically own the game
probably the same reason it won't let me rate mods on the workshop
why?
i bet i know why this wont let me upload my mod
:()
?
i love the art
but fwiw
oh
i would love to, but i don't have acces to mega stan
Shrektan
which one?
did you test my mod
oh paige
I can only help if all your doing is changing graphics
that's helpful
"error(-2) - unknown error"
i can't upload my mod
oh good
when an enemy dies it explodes in tears
well, it's a chain reaction
no one isaac should have all that power
best part of modding is doing testing imo https://i.gyazo.com/d9efc6785b467f786caeef0d928bc546.gif
but thanks for the suggestion
ive never dabbled too much using Lua so i'll look up a tutorial real quick
that could work
hmm
you could...add the custom challenge, when the run starts check if it's that challenge using getchallengeidbyname and set the stats that way?
what does that mean
i once saw someone make a challenge with a flag for "bigrange"
plus the website is already filled with shitpost mods
for a custom challenge
is it possible to set base stats
anyone here well versed with custom challenges
ab+ is enough of a shitpost already
we dont need more shitpost mods
please
hopefully nothing
what should my next shitpost mod be?
https://gyazo.com/879884797098cef68d03d9af14b33920 time for the zany testing
I'm not in teamBeta
im deleting that becuase im not proud of it anymore
well
^that doesnt mean it's the best
i was the OG green profile picture
gg
well then
No
can we all take a moment to appreciate that all our profile pics have green dudes in them?
doing something as in making a mod worth downloading
and thats shitposting, is what I'm doing
I'm actually doing something
hey
oh good, you're actually doing something
i'm actually proud of this one lol
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848056541
yes
isnt the turtle called snappy?
snappy
~~green cain~~
like?
i have other mods man
<@266032468853915650> green isaac is an old meme at this point that you're trying to force still
Shrek isn't tan though
<@266032468853915650> wtf is Shrek satan? its Shrektan
So I don't know
But Shrek Satan is also trash
Green Isaac is actual trash
well i guess since enemy shots are projectiles and entityprojectile doesn't exist and can't be cast to then...you can't access projectileparams and thus can't change enemy projectile speeds?
<@!182509747835109387> Which do you prefer, greenisaac or shrek satan?

you have to click the "change" button
so I figured out how to add an icon to your mods
oh
i thought it was through the steam client itself
oh thank god
with the moduploader in tools?
how do you upload to the workshop? i'm a bit afraid the button is missing for me
works very well, thanks ^^ https://gyazo.com/fd0cf0184580c618c592b6065c7f8582
rip
i just realized i might not be able to upload my mod
oops
oh
i would assume the same thing but i've never tried, let me take a peek
<@!135254843567767552> That works for the player, but how do you make enemy tears not fall down?
i was right
oh hey cool
thanks, that really helps alot
i set fallingspeed and fallingacceleration to 0
i assume make the accelleration 0? <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
it's also my reddit username for consistency
<@!135254843567767552> How do you make tears not fall down?
i should sellout my twitter in my username too, it's genius <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
i've only got the one mei post on there anyway it's not like i'm using it
Loli(@twittersellout)
```lua
-- If the player has monstro's lung
if  hasMonstrosLung then
    -- Between 3,7 times...
    for n=1,math.random(3,7) do
        -- Spawn a monstro's lung-y tear
        local tear = player:FireTear(entity.Position,velocityFromPlayer+Vector(math.random()*-4+2,math.random()*-4+2),tearCanBeEye,true,tearCanEndStreak)
        tear.FallingSpeed = -4 + math.random()*-4
        tear.FallingAcceleration = math.random() + .5
    end
end
```
i emulate monstro's lung on mei...let me grab that code
you could pass some randoms to the velocity vector yeah
or would that just make it go everywhere
couldn't you do like a math:random on firing?
i would set the tear height to something random between -40 and -23 and set the tear falling speed to something random between -1 and 1 i guess
set the falling speed negative with an acceleration? <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
hmm if i wanted to make mostro-like tears, what woud I change?
tear height is just combined with falling speed and falling acceleration yeah?
i did the file path right, i think
ye it did
how it works in what way kyozm?
did the costume example actually work for you? you might have your file paths a little messed up
has anyone figured out how to use tear.Height properly?
nah
do you have more than one item?
just trying to add a costume on item pickup
i'm not sure what you're trying but that's unfortunate
which is strange cause i only have 1 costume
<@!135254843567767552> didn't work for me :c
well dang
before it wouldn't let me use it <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
It's just a global emote.
No
omg is this a perk of being an angle? <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
wait what i can emote now? <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
oh hey its cirno
oh <:cirPrise:164613790485184512>
never gotten more than a 1 win streak :P
-300+
the highest loss streak i've gotten is like
i'm not the least bit confident in my isaac runs
"as soon as i die" so confident
what a dweeb
hahah this nerd plays the game
since in a run currently
see if it works for me
i'll try this as soon as i die loli
its beautiful
oh no
I need testers tho
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849134242 my mod worked
if you then go into the xml and remove costume C, costume B which is a passive costume will work fine
Costume C which is defined as an active works just fine if you give yourself the Costume C item and use it, but costumes A and B don't work
there's no main.lua file so you just have to `g Costume C` kinda thing
here's the mod i just made to test this https://files.catbox.moe/u92pv5.zip
that's also what i've been doing
what would be an example of that, loli?
I just apply the costumes on the cache updates :/
so wait
nicalis aint never gonna get they shit together
_i guess you could limit your mod to one costume i guess maybe_
yeah i dunno. it just seems to be the last costume / item pairing defined works and the others don't
epic
let's see if i can fix that though
i did a bit more testing with costumes and it looks like it's actually just the last costume in the definitions works
lol
sorry for the mention I meant <@90940715076423680>
<@162156525337575425>
here's the mod if you're at all interested http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849125422
your 1st suggestion worked , didn't test the 2nd, thanks!
hmm, I see, thanks
you can also get entities on their death bed during postupdate with `Entity:HasMortalDamage() and not Entity:IsDead()` from my experience
yeah
<@266032468853915650> in entity callback you can check if the damage they're about to take is >= their hitpoints
obviously different name but yeah
its just player:GetTrinketIdByName(petrified poop)?
mhm
well you get the point
lol
whoops that's the code I already edited
```
local Mod = RegisterMod("LazMod", 1)

function Mod:PostPlayerInit(player)
    if player:GetPlayerType() == PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS then
        if Game():GetFrameCount() == 0 then
            player:AddCard( 46 )
        end
    end
end

Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, Mod.PostPlayerInit)
```
*code
here's the doe
in the end he defined it using the GetTrinketIDByName command or something
i see
I think it was because the id was wrong
my mod is done
well besides getting a possibly improved sprite and a keeper functionality that im not even sure if i *can* add, and i can't test since i don't have keeper unlocked
this is my steam
http://steamcommunity.com/id/FruitcupDelight
what ended up being the solution?
oh, did i?
I'd like to credit you for helping solve the lazarus problem
paige, what's your steam id
umm, how do I know if an enemy has died from the entity damage callback?
i feel like i shouldn't even bother if its that finnicky
jeez
and i had her null costume defined first in the costumes2.xml file. this was so i could apply the null costume, but i didn't need it anyway. the item crashed because of some costume issues, but when i switched the order, the costume worked just fine
for example, i was testing adding mei's hair as a costume to a passive item i was going to force her to carry at all times
top down as you define the tags in costumes2.xml
what do you mean by order
i found you can apply a costume to an item without an id and without adding a null costume in the code, but it depends on the order of your costumes2.xml and your items.xml
you'd think it'd be simple
costumes are a mysterious beast i was trying to work out yesterday
Kinda need ideas
Should I do a character redesign mod or a changed item descriptions mod?
bit confused on those.
yeah i'm not sure about costumes
not sure what's up
the item still functions without the costume
having a similar issue with adding  a costume leading to a crash
and now picking up the item crashes my game :x
like i added the nessecary code for the costume
i crash my game when i try to add a costume
i did something wrong
whew okay
did ya fix it?
okay
I'll read your idea but idk if I can test it, I really need to go to bed
ill dm you, its a bit longer
actually, i think this is the main root of you problem
it didn't
if that doesnt work, i have another idea
and then change the callback to Mod.init
replace the LazMod:init() with Mod:init()
```
local Mod = RegisterMod("LazMod", 1)
local player = Isaac.GetPlayerType

function LazMod:init()
    local game = Game()
    if player == PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS then
        if game:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
            player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)
        end
    end
end

Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)
```
here's the final code right now
nope
I'll try it
try using that for the playertype if statement
more like lazaruse
lazarus
not sure if it makes a difference in lua, but in most languages you need == instead of = in the if statement <@201091583553175553>
*player
maybe mc_post_palyer_init is just broken or something
a learning expierence
nah its fun to try and troubleshoot this imo
I don't wanna bother you guys anymore though
again, still nothing
even if it doesn't use a lot, totally makes sense why you wouldn't do it
nah its still smart to be consistent
~~not that the amount of memory that uses is a lot~~
there's no reason to keep it there, it wastes memory
community standards are silly
no idea why
supposedly its community standard to do local game = Game() at the start
yes
```
function LazMod:init()
    local game = Game()
    if player = PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS then
        if game:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
            player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)
        end
    end
end
```
like this?
about that
i've heard varying things
put it in the function
oh, Game shouldn't be done like that
same place mods go
where's that again?
thats what im about to check, actually
what does log say
sorry but it didn't seem to
```Lua
local LazMod = RegisterMod("LazMod", 1)
local player = Isaac.GetPlayerType
local game = Game()

function LazMod:init()
    if player = PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS then
        if game:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
            player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)
        end
    end
end

LazMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)```
i *think* this works, dunno though, didn't try it myself
I'm sure I'll figure it out
I g2g, but thanks anyway
man I wish they hadn't removed the ability to edit default characters, this would be finishable in seconds
cause i don't wanna spam or nothin
dm me
here
unfortunately it's still borked
you are being helpful, I appreciate it
fwiw i barely know what im doing but i'm trying to be helpful
but in the end it barely matters
¯\_(?)_/¯
my bad then
o i c
@yatboim I figured it was because this other mod I'm looking at used a framecount of 0
for a new run, ofc
just tested it, on init game's frame count is 0 
```lua
function mod:PostPlayerInit()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    Isaac.DebugString(Log("player init",Game():GetFrameCount()))
end
```
`[INFO] - Lua Debug: player init 0 `
`player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)`
because
but you do, i think
right?
naw I didn't need to because PLAYER_LAZARUS is his actual ID
:P
you forgot to define player
oh lol
on some other things
but thats how i did it for myself
maybe
¯\_(?)_/¯
I think the second "then" may be unnecessary
there we go
I'll add it
i forgot 1 end
oh wait
Try this
```Lua
function LazMod:init()
    if player:GetPlayerType() == PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS then
        if game:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
            player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)
        end
    end
end```
even when using the same id
nope, because that made a new lazarus instead of editing the old one
anymore?
you said you couldn't just add an id in the players.xml
as-is the mod is nothing but a main.lua
it might be a deeper issue like not having a players.xml or something
sec
if not, i might have another solution
unfortunately no
did that work?
okay then
just to make it easier
`local mod = RegisterMod(LazMod)` should just be `local LazMod`
oh wait, noticed something else wrong i think
cause that is correct
too
make sure you changed it to `LazMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)`
alright
change get frame count == 0 to == 1
what
try something for me
rogue
oh
because that didn't work
cause im crashin' at enable of mod
you mean change it to 
```
LazMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)
```
?
wait, to clarify
i have an xml error apparently
hmm
You're welcome
thank you
yeah, that should be LazMod not Mod
`Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)`
`local Mod = RegisterMod("LazMod", 1)`
let me check
well it doesn't crash or anything, just nothing happens
anything in the log?
I've gone over it several times but something's eluding me
```
local Mod = RegisterMod("LazMod", 1)
local game = Game()

function LazMod:init()
    if player:GetPlayerType() == PlayerType.PLAYER_LAZARUS and game:GetFrameCount() == 0 then
        player:AddTrinket(TrinketType.TRINKET_PETRIFIED_POOP)
    end
end

Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, LazMod.init)
```
I'm trying to make lazarus start with petrified poop, anyone see something wrong with this code?
that usually generates the metadata.xml
and do a run
and turn it on
go ingame
I can't upload my mod, because it doesn't have a metadata.xml
if you mean for actually uploading the mod uploader makes you one
it's generated automatically innit?
How do I do the metadata.xml
does peffect only proc if your stats get edited?
if any of the guys who worked on alphabirth are here, i'm really enjoying the mod so far
?
maybe just give him deep pockets for shits and gigs
there should be some sort of function to remove a held pickup but I don't know whether ab+ has it or not
well if I wanted be lazy I guess just having a pill appear on the ground next to him at the start wouldn't be awful
the ab+ api really forces you to find dumb hacky ways to get anything done
my idea was to let lazarus start with suicide king because he's already based on finding an opportune moment to kill himself
the issue is that lazarus already holds a pill
well I could try giving him an item on frame one like normal
I'm not sure if there's a way around it but yeah they disabled most of the old method of modding
even if I copy-paste the original players.xml, it adds a slew of new blank characters instead of my edits applying to the real ones
did they remove the ability to edit characters already in the game?
Damn Robo-Baby really upped his events display game
asteroids probably wouldn't be too hard to do too
and smash tv to some extent
you could probably do arkanoid rather easily as well
pac man and space invaders now
that would be impressive as hell tbh
...which is impossible because no room generation hooks <:LUL:229765547787550720>
i will be impressed when zelda 1 is remade
pacman
uh
i'm still waiting for that "recreate entire games" remark to be proven by someone
don't know how possible it would be in ab+ however
^
and i was thinking isaac with necrodancer elements
I was thinking just a simple character and floor mod
The fuck
and you have necrodancer but halfway good
reimplement necrodancer's beat system
give them telegraphed attacks
just make it so isaac and the enemies move on that grid
now isaac has a grid based system
how exactly would it work?
hmm
well let's see
uh
It would be "eh"
basement of the demented mother
What if a mod mashed up Crypt of the Necrodancer and Issac
<@126369664170328064> here's my useCard function, sorry about the wait http://pastebin.com/YGRGzUxF
can you show an example?
i've tried using it like that, but haven't gotten it to work properly. i just use if/else chains to do stuff based on card_id
I thought it worked as MC_USE_ITEM
so you know what card you are using
oh
yeah the card use callback gives you a card id
card_id ?
like `function mod:UseCard(card_id)`?
did you set up your function correctly?
I've made some custom cards, but, whenever I use one of them, it triggers the same effect (so, all cards apply the same effect). What migh I have done wrong
something like that works
```
for i=0,room:GetGridSize(),1 do
    local ent = room:GetGridEntity(i);
    if (ent ~= nil) then
        --code here
    end
end
```
What's the command to get all grid entities, like Isaac.GetRoomEntities()?
I dunno though
Check health of mega stan and if below 100% play animation
I assume the code for it would be relatively simple
prolly could
Which is that mega stans blood filled symbol on the ground should slowly deplete and represent his health
I wonder if It's possible to mod my biggest pet peeve in Isaac
Hmm
solid asset unloading code i guess
Why does disabling a mod crash my game?
the version
I forgot
the registermod string
i don't know what you're talking about, but if you fixed it cool
If it didn't matter then my shit would have been working from the start <@!135254843567767552>
Or is it version number of your mod
Of the API? Isnt it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The version number
I did it
Well yes
I know god damnit
you need a ,1 after the name
also that is actually wrong
welp
Just so you know :)
Your variable has to match your registermod function and your getitemIDbyname has to match you items.xml name
I should drink more water
That's all
yup
Your modname was  wrong
wow
and it works now
rip
FUUUCK okay I got it
am I just retarded
```local BetterChampions = RegisterMod("Better Champions")``` is that supposed to mean there's something wrong here

how does a text file not work
wtf
log.txt isnt working
ye
```Isaac.Explode(entity.Position, entity, 1.0)``` *should* work, yes?
k thats what I thought
jsut 217 i guess based on the doco
uhh
Do I have to say ```217``` or ```217.3```
My variant is three
Wait, for the callback
aight
true
if it was an xml thing it would probably crash
slap those 3 values in and then check your log.txt for errors
could it be an xml thing
k then
probably not no
...could it be indentation?
but that's what you need so it was something else not working
nice username btw
thats what I had earlier and it didn't work <@!135254843567767552>
you pass in a position (entity.Position) a source (entity or player or something) and how much damage it does (60)
i told you, you need to check the health - damage <= 0
what do
```if(entity:IsDead()) then
                Isaac.Explode(something something)```
ALL gridcollision types do that
but can't pass through the bottom and top walls.
No matter what I do, entities can just run freely through the left and right side walls
Explode (Vector pos, Entity source, float damage)
Now my only problem is grid collision
what else is necessary
Alright, cheers
you render it every frame in Post render, not post update
..what parameters
if I do it once, it disappears instantly
If I do it per update, it flashes
<@!135254843567767552> Know how to render text to a position on the screen and keep it there?
you're missing all the parameters
Isaac.Explode isn't anything though
i mean
How do I render text and keep it there? It disappears instantly when I render it with Isaac.RenderText()
Why
Wont
This
***Work***
```math.randomseed(Random())

I know there's Isaac.explode() aswell
He made exploding nickels
Lytebringr has a tutorial that might help?
Uhh
How to make things explode when they die
Like I actually have no clue
Can someone help me with something
Also it should be noted EntityPlayer:AddMaxHeart(1) does work on blue baby, but removing probably uses soul hearts -1
Thanks!
have fun
?
I type slowly on a phone and I'm out on my way to a date lol
It's okay :)
sorry paige lol
Dang it
It should be addsoulhearts(-1)
I'm silly.
oh
you can AddBlackHearts, AddSoulHearts, and AddMaxHearts all with positive and negative values
AddHearts(-1) just reduces his health
Also with blue baby
I had the opposite effect where my mod made him infinitely gain health
Does it instantly kill him?
oh like with blue baby
according to robo baby you don't know
LOL
Yep!
EntityPlayer:AddMaxHearts(-1) or something
I know!
like with Blue Baby and soul hearts
That, or turn all health into black hearts
There seems to be only a function for removing black hearts under PlayerEntity?>
How do I remove a red heart
sounds neato
i dunno some anime nerd garbage
what is that imagehosting site
<https://files.catbox.moe/siv5al.png>
you could iterate through all gridentities and if they have the right type destroy them, all the appropriate functionality is on the Room class
Find them an destroy them
what check exactly? check where they are on the room?
So how would I check for it in the code?
tnt is a grid entity i think it's gridspawn 1300 in the console
is it a variant of fireplaces/poop?
but there isn't one for normal tnt
I can get moving tnt using Entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_MOVABLE_TNT
Anyone know how to get the entity 'TNT'>
can someone assist me in  making a function that triggers a pill effect just after you enter each room?
just don't install them both at once then
if you have 2 characters by the same name it may screw up with both installed
that's true...
hopefully the mods have different names in the list as well
actually isn't there something to say? after all, you get character ids by name?
i am working on a completely different mod so
yeah
but it will confuse people XD
so i think i missed it
There's nothing to say you can't have two characters with the same name
i haven't been online much
oh
I did say it twice
robo-baby on point with the reactions
Mine's been on the workshop for a few days now lol
oh
so did I :v
>_>
http://puu.sh/txgoO/1d028e6af6.jpg
i made a character named Silas
oh yeah
Hush is harder
Delirium is a bad boss
delirium ez?
but erm 15000 dps seems a bit much
Maybe
this isn't my mod
Did I break something
Antibiotic-Status effects don't effect you
lel
and yours is just a mad doctor for some reason
?
I've released a character named Silas
Yeahhh...
starfall has his character named after a bible character, silas
<@170676832054542337> what do you mean Silas has stats now?
You can alwyas just spawn player creep
Hmm :v
try morph()? idk
there are different effect variants for player creeps and regular creeps
<@219159380094877696> nope didnt work :c Any other ideas?
which makes dealing with the damage source a little unfortunate
yes from my experience entityref sucks and the entity returned isn't fully functional
what do you mean haha
? ?
yay silas has stats now
http://puu.sh/txk7O/0fb658b166.png
ah, ill try thanks
try making its parent the player
how would i go about making creep "friendly"?
hmm.
tch
I can add the entities themselves to the table and kill them that way though
OK so entityref just sucks.
EntityRef seems broken as hell :/
nor does Kill, nor does TakeDamage.
It doesn't work.
I'm doing exactly that.
EntityRef.Entity:Die()
Doesn't work with TakeDamage() either
hmm
Yep
```Lua
victims = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
        for i = 1, #victims do
...
table.insert(army, 1, EntityRef(victims[i]))
```
are you sure that you're passing in an entity to EntityRef when you're calling it?
since they're both not in EntityRef but both in Entity
Makes no sense why I can ask if it exists but not kill it
hmm
attempt to call a nil value (method 'Die')
nil method kill
what's the log say
nor does kill
thing.Entity:Die() doesn't work
How would I kill an entity from it's reference?
keep track of the current room, and check for if it's different
I'll double check
maybe.
Here's something I can't figure out from the docs
well, there's no callback for that yet so you'd have to use a post_update
ok, another question: is there an easy/simple way of making a function activate whenever you move to a new room?
you should probably look at the docs :^)
._.
EntityRef.Entity
or get the thing it's referencing
then how do I make it an actual entity
well it's an entityRef right? not an actual Entity?
' attempt to call a nil value (method 'IsDead')'
it didn't
then that should work fine, asuming that iteration is the same
How do.
```Lua
for man = 1, #army do
      if army[man]:IsDead() then
```
1.
starting at 1 or 0?
Iterating over it
i meant how using the table
what's the correct syntax to grab it
EntityRef(entity)
well how are you storing it?
Entity(table[i]):Method()?
OK so I'm storing an EntityRef() into a table, how do I grab that entity from the table and use methods from it
it's not PERFECT update it's PEFFECT update i thought
welcome
YES
OH
**You have been blessed.** You are now an <@&206620122616561664> :angel:
i want to be an angel
cool
neat blue name bois
what is MC_POST_PERFECT_UPDATE useful for?
cheater

!items
fuckin end me
also i have magneto and gnawed leaf
rip

!items
what am i doing wrong
Try hanging around more.
You need to have at least **3** items if you expect me to make wings for you.
i want that chalenged guy to be an angel
i want to be an angel
GOTTEM
TOO LATE I ALREADY COPYRIGHTED IT
am already stealing
IP donut steal
though
that's actually good
so it's about using your active if you need to and not having to worry about it
well i dunno what playstyle you're going for, just throwing out ideas
he has low speed
but that completely contradicts the playstyle of silas
that's good
ok
how about it uses up a charge of your active to absorb the hit (Copyright Chalenged 2017)
it does something to your active
prayer card is bad
so that when you get hit
make it give you a prayer card on random
how could i change it
yeh
but then it was just a better version of the habit
that when you get hit it recharges your active
i was making an item
brainstorming time boys
ok
i had something else, dw
good luck
it works
ok
Time to play "Which collision class is the right fucking one?"
oh god the collision stuff again
that doesn't work
It's still colliding with rocks
GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_NONE
not walls
*rocks
I tried GridCollisionWalls but that doesnt work
dant forget the bromstone
How do I make an entity I spawned stop colliding with rocks
and dark bum and cambion conception
why not give them a heirophant to really rub it in
dont give the character too much items
what if the lost started with child's heart, the mitre and satanic bible
I don't think you can have only an eternal heart
nah, the character would get soul hearts and stuff
but you get a heart on basement 2
can you give eternal hearts with xml only?
the lost
so
too stronk
not prayer card
nice
ew no
+ prayer card
starts with 1 eternal heart
*could* that work
would that even work
that's a cool idea
oh
eternal*
immortal heart?
thank
here i fixed it
What if he started with just an immortal heart
don't compromise it doesn't matter
just use 1 or 2
lol
that doesn't look right either
http://puu.sh/txgoO/1d028e6af6.jpg
just draw a blended heart
brb
i'll try 1 and a little one
so is blue baby at -3 health then?
it gives you the blue aura
eh
poof
-1 (soul heart) and 1 (normal heart)
btw, does anyone know how to add the effect of the soul for one room?
I've been using  `player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SOUL,true)`
but it doesn't seem to deflect shots
just set it 0
so i did that
but it looked weird
i was going to
fix it fix it fix it
make a half line
that's confusing just do 1 or 2 lines
o
lol
1 red heart 1 soul heart
uwot
1/2
how does a character have 1 and 1/11 health
i'm confused didn't Maddogs make a Silas character ?
noo
reported for harassment
what have i done
oh no
don't think it will
did that unping ?
noice
yey
:^)
nice ping
<@268073737142665218>   LuaDocs/class_entity_player.html
regardless it's what you meant ;p
or that's what i've been told
k
` is a grave
yes
` <- these?
what do you mean by triple graves
hello everyone, I am planning a mod, where a card multiplies x3 the number of coins the player, but can not find the command, can anyone help me please thanks
i need help
you can also add `lua` after the first 3 to make it colorful
hi
please use the triple graves
i _think_ that HasMortalDamage() was meant to do that but i have no idea what it actually does
```function BetterChampions:darkgreenDipAI(entity)

    if entity.Variant == 3 then
        if (Isaac:GetFrameCount() % math.random(61, 83) == 0) then
            entity.Velocity = Vector(math.random(-10, 10), math.random(-10, 10))
        end

        if(entity:IsDead()) then
            Isaac.Explode(entity.Position, entity, 1.0)
        end
    else
        if entity.FrameCount <= 5 then
            local chance = math.random(1,15)
            if chance == 1 then
                enemy = entity:ToNPC()
                if enemy then
                    enemy:Morph(EntityType.ENTITY_DIP,
                        3,
                        0,
                        0)
                end
            end
        end
    end
end```
^
you need to check if hp - dmg <= 0
um, if this is in a Take_Damage callback, IsDead won't trigger, because the callback is before the damage is applied
so wtf
tho
I've got this
try using triple grave around the whole block instead of single around a line
```if(entity:IsDead()) then
            Isaac.Explode(entity.Position, entity, 1.0)
        end```
I just copypaste
in the code, the things are there
discord is weird
idk
okay so why are there no underscores in the first one
work
you know
will that
``local darkgreen_dip_chance = math.random(1,15)
            if darkgreen_dip_chance == 1 then``
XD
oh.
in Entity class

shutdoors...? ?
`<entity ... shutdoors="false"`
the crosshair is something I'm spawning
Also is there a list anywhere as to the variant IDs to make an entity not register as an enemy, therefore rooms can still be cleared with it alive?
what's thuis crosshair thing ?
I believe Isaac.Explode() is what you're looking for
any way to get rid of it? :v
so I can't see anything at all in the log
every 0.001 seconds
I'm getting that error jean
how can I make that happen
the stupid thing wont explode
```ass```
ikr
hahah always cracks me up when people post code and ` every line
if you look at the log when there's stone fatties in the room it's filled with warnings "no animation Head"
well that's just a warning
overlay effect...?
```[warn] No OverlayEffect Null found for Entity Crosshair Marker with sprite gfx/effects/crosshair_marker.anm2```
I'm also getting another weird error I can't figure out
Hmm
don't ask me haha
For the other mods its 1 and it works...
But why does it have to be 5?
`<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">`
are you sure that that xml has the version set properly?
dunno it's weird
Why is that error a thing? My other XMLs are version 1, and for other mods too
nope, log says nothing
I have no idea but it's annoying :v
did isaac update?
?????
```Invalid version 1 for c:\users\maddogs/documents/my games/binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/melis/content/entities2.xml```
Badly need help here :/
also wtf is this
what's the log say? anything?
what am I doing wrong
`local BetterChampions = RegisterMod("Better Champions")

math.randomseed(Random())

function BetterChampions:darkgreenDipAI(entity)

    if entity.Variant == 3 then

BetterChampions:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_NPC_UPDATE, BetterChampions.darkgreenDipAI, 217)`
okay so I'm trying to make a dip that explodes
And just prints success when it runs
Functions
I was gonna make a thing that lets me test guvfyond
that tells people to read the log
i should make like a faq or something
also check the log
so it only responds to that one
I wonder if duolingo has Japanese yet
oh merlo, as another parameter to the AddCallback, give it the card ID
thanks again, you've been really helpful
if someone wants to help a lil noobie just pm me and when I wake up i'll see it, thanks a lot ?
tbh i'll go to sleep since it's pretty late where i am
lol
?
and if you want someone to practice talking to feel free to hit me up
if you really want to learn then go do it, there's plenty of online resources to help you out
Truu
you just become good one day
everyone's bad when they start lol
But I'm bad at stuff like that
I'm a secret weeb so I would love to learn :P
so there's some overlap
i know, but kanji takes from chinese
Nihon land
oops
? is book and ? is tree
Chinese =/= Japanese
ah, it's "nihongo", which means japanese. The first kanji means "sun" and the second is "book"
ri ben is japan ;p
Oh wait,
I know a little bit of mandarin, that first bit looks like "sun tree power"
wish i knew more of it though, still learning it
????????? <3
Wish I could read that tho
I did aswell since phone
Changed MCP to MoreCards but the rest is the same
no i was just curious if they actually could read it
the callback was MoreCards:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_CARD, MoreCards.useCard) btw
is it wrong?
I did
did you google translate that?
:P
Good morning to you too
????????
My mod I finished last night Uses getnumcoins
fuuuuck
oh boy people are waking up
the caps
I can help merlo in like 20 minutes
<@141237286162530304> instead of `Addcoins`, do `AddCoins`
pretty sure they work
ill get bashed for this probably
or idk
wait does lua not allow variables to start with underscores?
don't put _ before card, call it just `card`
as far as i've learned, putting _ before a variable will make lua not declare it
You need to use the `AddCallback` function for that to do anything. Right now it's just a function that's never being called, assuming you haven't set the callback
~~inb4 what is a callback~~
Where are you setting the callback?
still does not do anything :/
and the function is `AddCoins()` i believe
and don't do `local` when you add coins. Local is only when you're declaring a new variable
no need to do Isaac.GetPlayer(0):GetNumCoins() when you already have the player in a variable. Do `player:GetNumCoins()` instead
stuck with this then
function MPC:useCard(_card)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local numCoins = Isaac.GetPlayer(0):GetNumCoins()
    if _card == ThreeofDiamonds then
        if numCoins == 0 then
            local player:Addcoins(3)
        end
    end
end
????
okay, I see
especailly not something like coins, which could change at any moment
so you shouldn't be doing _anything_ relating to the player outside of a function or callback
and also, the code outside of that function will be ran only when the mod is loaded, which means there might not even be a player then
aaaaaah okay
like how you are declaring `player` in the function, because you only need it in that function
you declare variables in the scope you need them
numCoin is just a variable I made up
don't you need to declare variables at the beginning?
and you shouldn't be getting coin number outside of the function
well you're trying to define `numCoins` twice, and i'm not even sure what `local numCoins = integer` is meant to accomplish
I'm also learning C++ but I'm not that far into it yet, yeah
i assume lua is your first programming language?
local numCoins = integer
local numCoins = Isaac.GetPlayer(0):GetNumCoins()
function MPC:useCard(_card)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if _card == ThreeofDiamonds then
        if numCoins == 0 then
            local player:Addcoins(3)
        end
    end
end


like this?

Sorry for the bother btw, I just learned lua basics like a week ago so I'm still a bit rough on it, I promise I wont bother that much in the future lol
yep I did
i always do
but it's plausible i did forget it lel
let me doublecheck
unless you just missed that line in pasting
sure did
i missed the function one didnt i
also you don't have enough `end` statements
ah shit okay, that's one thing I did wrong then
try `threeOfDiamonds` or something
even if it did, it's bad practice
which i very highly doubt
ah
unless lua allows you to start variable names with numbers?
i mean no matter what other code you could have, `_card == 3ofDiamonds` will not work
there's also other code I didn't send
no yeah ik
also you can't just do `_card == 3ofDiamonds`
or just `local numCoins = player:GetNumCoins(0)` if player is already set
to get the number of coins you want to do `local numCoins = Isaac.GetPlayer(0):GetNumCoins()`
i'm confused then
the card usage mechanic should be working, i think i'm doing dumb shit with the other code
the goal was to check if player coins are 0 and get them to 3 if yes
what are you even doing merlo? You're trying to overwrite a function that already exists?
Vincent, what you want to do is add the code i posted before, that tells the game to re-evaluate damage items, in a POST_UPDATE callback, after checking if they have your item, and then make a cacheupdate callback that will actually change the player.Damage
Shouldn't this work?

local numCoins = integer
EntityPlayer:GetNumCoins (numCoins)
function MPC:useCard(_card)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if _card == 3ofDiamonds then
        if numCoins == 0 then
            EntityPlayer:Addcoins(3)
        end
    end
i have yet to look into monsters
not really but try and see if a workshop mod already exists
Or bosses?
Does anybody know how to code enemies?
but i'm not the most skilled of coders
not sure then
Yields same results ?
i think it's EntityPlayer
Right, I have failed miserably in re-evaluating my items. Where should I put "player:EvaluateItems()" ? I've tried so hard but item did not work.
and tbh i kinda wish a good ending for poor little Isaac
had this idea
heh
but muh canon
i just had an idea for my mod, i realised that since Judas was unlocked when defeating satan, you could have a boss, that after defeat helps you as a new character, and now i was thinking of making it so that character helps Isaac to fight his self-hatred (which's embodiment replaces either Mega Satan or the Lamb) and make it so that Isaac doesn't kill himself by suffocating in the chest, to give it sort of a happy ending
Hah, definitely not. I'm weird.
i just assumed that your folder would be the same name as the mod
Ah. Okay then.
note that it's the folder name, not necessarily modname
Console is giving me this error:  Failed to run mod! I am absolutely sure that my mod name is correct.
Yeah, I know. I did tell them to do so but apparently that's actually an important feature for few occasions so they won't disable it. I did not question further.
personally i'd use both methods
alternatively, tell your friend that they can disable steam telling them whenever a friend launches a game
`luamod modname`
What was the console command to re-load a mod after editing ? My friends are starting to get mad as I am frequently re-starting the game.
thanks (again, lul!)
dumb me
i was looking for enums

aaah
Classes -> EntityPlayer
check the docs located in your installation folder/tools/LuaDocs
oh, the player has functions for that
like say the amount of coins he has
i mean the one the player already owns
i believe the pickups are just entities in the room
Note that when you use EvaluateItems() you need to have the proper cache_flag set
Last thingy guys, sorry hahaah

where are player pickups (HP, coins, bombs and keys) stored? Can't find that on the lua libs
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks!
you need to re-evaluate items with EntityPlayer:EvaluateItems() forcefully to update them outside of natural events
So basically I'm trying to make an item which increases your damage following a certain formula if you don't have any empty or half empty heart containers. The problem is, it's not being updated. After I pickup the item with empty heart containers and fill them later, the item is not taking effect. Can someone take a look to see what I've done wrong or which concept I've misunderstood? https://hastebin.com/boyatawedu.lua
yes it does work! thanks a lot man, really helpful!
let me try
I think i figured that out ok
oooh so the hud calls the animation to display
alright im basically copying from the other mod:
the anm2 file and the sprites for the anm2 should be in mod\content\gfx\
the hud line in xml should correspond to the correct animation name in the anm2 file
...i think that's it
So what do I need to make in the animation file, just point to the sprite i need?
Ooooooooooooooooh
<@141237286162530304> well uhh the card name doesn't need to be the same as animation, my mistake
what's a bed
did you check beneath your bed?
ah shit i lost my custom card code
`Sprite` classes are actually animation collections, `anm2`s
the usage of "sprite" is misleading in isaac
ooooooh it's the animation file i need to get the sprites?
the game checks for that kind of stuff and its one way to make it work i guess
for consistency, make sure that the hud (in xml), the name of the card, and the animation name in anm2 is the same
but where do I need to specify which is which?
yeah, I made a new one and got that in content, with the four sprites i need
c o n s i s t e n c y
you dont modify the ui, you make another one
rest in peace i guess
I got the ui_frontcards sheet modified, but I can't seem to find where to actually set them for the card
nice, __type on Vector crashes the game
I managed to code in a few new cards, but I can't get around on how to assign a sprite to each one of them
Could you guys help me with something?
__type is set for some stuffs
Oh
i mean, they've done a bit
if you tostring() stuff you can usually figure out what their type is
"it depends on the devs to do that" = "no"
uh
kinda-ish, but it depends on the devs to do that
like `Vector(0, 0).__class` or something like that
is there any way to get the class name of an instance?
i tried and couldn't
is there no way to add new grid entities?
okay ty
i think it checks to see if the player has no missing red hearts yes, doesn't check for having 12 red hearts
player:HasFullHearts checks if players hearth containers are all full right ?
though again i haven't tested that
just store its original name from :GetFilename()
sure you can, i think
wait but no the original spritesheet is from the game files so i won't be able to put it back
ah
but i can try replacing the spritesheet
this is actually a GridEntity and i don't think they inherit from Entity :/
i suppose you could also go the really forceful way and replace its spritesheet with a single transparent pixel but i haven't tested that
entities can be .Visible = false and Sprites can be :SetColor(Color(1,1,1,0,0,0,0),duration,priority,true,true) for sprite invisibility
create your modfolder in isaac mods folder
if you want to edit existing items, copy from the items.xml from the game and put it in modfolder\resources\items.xml
if you want to edit your added items, make an items.xml in modfolder\content\ and add all your custom items (like the original format but without the existing items)
pocketitems.xml too
as well as pills, cards
items.xml
which XML would i use
specifically
how would i edit item names and flavor text
ok
<@!135254843567767552> thanks!
obvisouly entity.Sprite = Sprite() works but then what if i want to make it visible later on
how can i make a Sprite not render ? be invisible
otherwise you could check if the stage has changed since last update and if it has keep track of the floors the player through through yourself
could probably use ```lua
LevelStage = {
    STAGE_NULL = 0,
    STAGE1_1 = 1,
    STAGE1_2 = 2,
    STAGE2_1 = 3,
    STAGE2_2 = 4,
    STAGE3_1 = 5,
    STAGE3_2 = 6,
    STAGE4_1 = 7,
    STAGE4_2 = 8,
    STAGE4_3 = 9,
    STAGE5 = 10,
    STAGE6 = 11,
    STAGE7 = 12,...
```
Hey, I'm making a mod that increases your damage as you progress through the game. So I have a damage update formula like this: dmg = dmg/2 + floornumber/10
However I have not been able to figure out how to get floor number. Any ideas ?
what's the argument for ChangeRoom?
few ways you can give invincibility, you can set damage cooldown or return false on player take damage events
oh he's woob again
how do you give the player invincibility?
Would it be hard to change the HP of big horn and ragman (Since theyre both pretty annoying)
All the tutorials beyond that did not go in to what I wanted to do
<@193989394128961536>
you need to create it
how do you detect the player receiving lethal damage? HitPoints isn't used by player
Oh.. im really stupid
Cant seem to find it anywhere
Uh..
Where is content located?
ok apparently it's `ItemConfig.Config`?
I might have messed up my game
Oh, i've already used that.. Thanks for telling me
*tools
you can use the unpacker in Isaacfolder>tools
Im making it for Afterbirth+ :-)
Do i need to use ricks unpacker before i can do that <@223869207748542464> ? Really sorry if thats a noob question. Still figuring out how to use it
how do you access Config.IsValidCollectible again?
content>entities2.xml
if anyone can help me out  ?
if i wanted to make a mod that changes the HP of a boss/s where would i go?
Hey
Ah okay
ingame
adding/removing blindfold
no I meant dynamically
Lilith does that
<@268036083827212290> I believe you can just set "canfire=false" in players.xml
I mean on the HUD
is it possible to add extra lives?
for anyone who needs, last card value is 51
yeah nevermind I found out
the default one is the magician
like which spawn iteration do i need to spawn certain cards?
because 0 MaxFireDelay is possible
which will ensure it's at least 1 so you can't shoot
`math.max(1, player.MaxFireDelay)`
actually
actually just set it to MaxFireDelay so that it works nicely when you take the blindfold off
set FireDelay to more than 0
and in post_update
just give the player the blindfold costume
found a workaround
Is there a way to console give you pickups/cards?
how do you apply blindfold?
if only it was like Don't Starve where the entire game is made in lua so you can just do anything
ah okay i see
You should instead find a mod that accomplishes a similar task to what you want and see how they do it
The main game was programmed in C++, so none of the base game things are available for us to review
is there any chance that main game codes for idk the 2 of hearts or something are found somewhere?
i'll start looking into it
dunno how hard it is, but it's certainly possible
I think somebody might've done it, not sure
In practice...
In theory, it's supported
wanted to make more cards
haven't looked into it yet, but is it hard to add new consumables to the game?
hey guys
You'll probably want to check if the character is your modded one before adding the item.
now every character has cthulhu
tho it conflicts with every other character mod xD
?
I'M SUPER HAPPY NOW
I FINALLY GOT MY COSTUME TO WORK!!!!
?
I dun wanna crash the game
kk just checking
your item
what does the uritem mean?
thanks
ah, ok
i recommend you not to use players.xml and instead add it somewhere in lua:
```lua
local uritem = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Your item")
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:AddCollectible(uritem, 0, true)
```
what id do you use?
How do you make a character start with a modded item?
Would it be possible in the current API to make a boss launch a projectile that interacts with a button on the floor? 

I want to make a Grimace boss that you have to trick into deactivating itself with boulder projectiles lobbed onto buttons
It fixed itself. Well.
Hey so im not really code-savvy so I had a small question about what's mechanically possible as far as brand-new bosses and enemies go...
i dunno
.-.
?-?
Is there a common issue with :FireTear where the palyer shoots two tears instead of one

Does anyone like Danganronpa?
Bubble Cutter:Jojo Meme
oh right... rerolls >.<
honestly i just tried to do that with Mei and it hasn't changed anything, she still loses her hair upon reroll and such, sigh sigh sigh
It might be easier for me to just have the costume as an item only applied to my character
is there any standardized way to have custom cards/trinkets spawn ingame?
ive been trying that and post update
ill try that again
yep
wait, you're using postplayerinit
can i send you my code?
the logs seem fine
is player actually defined before that point for example
player:AddCoins(98) is a line I have in my postplayerinit and it works fine so your problem might be elsewhere, checked your log?
do i need to update the consumables somehow? i honestly have no idea what to do atm lol
you probably named your post player init callback function incorrectly if you didn't get a line number <@183454711834345473>
ok so the if statement to check if its a new run is working, but the player:AddCoins(50) is not...
Error in PostPlayerInit call: attempt to call a nil value <<< what does this mean? it was found in my log
and i need it to give 50 coins then heal it up completely, so that would be really sloppy to have 2 quarters and then hearts in the room. would prefer for it to be automatic
it cant be in players.xml because it doesnt update the health given from greeds gullet
put 2 quarters in the starting room or in players.xml
any ideas for giving 50 coins at the beginning of a run?
I don't know if my costume is even going on the person
?
there's nothing to do, i haven't done anything
do you think you could do it to my mod?
i honestly don't know, i just added the null costume and nothing else. it does have priority "99" in the costume definition, but i don't think i even use the costume definition
nice training dummy
so that the  costume is over the top of the other
By override I mean, like this <@!135254843567767552>
```
function mod:PostPlayerInit(player)
    local game = Game()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    local room = game:GetRoom()
    if player:GetPlayerType() == character then
        if level:GetAbsoluteStage() == 1 and level.EnterDoor == -1 and player.FrameCount == 1 then
            player:AddCoins(50)
        end
    end
end
```
also tried without the player.FrameCount == 1 and it still didnt work
ive been using         if level:GetAbsoluteStage() == 1 and level.EnterDoor == -1 and player.FrameCount == 1 then
Not even in the Game:GetFrames() == 1?
ive tried player:Coins = 50 and player:AddCoins(50) in the update but it doesnt seem to work
how do i add coins at the beginning of a run without using players.xml?
mei's hair doesn't override anything either, so no
I'll prob play around with Velocity a bit
<@139904316495364098> lots of shit is missing from the docu
that will apply it and make it override items like tech?
```lua
local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/character_mei.anm2")
player:AddNullCostume(costume)```
i've been considering actually putting her costume on an item though so that i can avoid all the weirdness that comes with it
i just addnullcostume'd that
How do I apply a costume like mei's hair?
oh so player:AddMaxHearts(-number)?
add negative heart containers
i cant find anything in the documentation
it was just something he threw together for a laugh
is there no way to remove heart containers?
tiny planet distance might be hardcoded
yes that was me
IDK what it really was.
yeah I checked it was him
Well I know you are/were working on something a little bit back. Looked like a console and you had some control on stuff
Oh
anyway it wasn't me
I think it was him?
The HP limit removal was epicbob?
ohwait
I have a philosophical disagreement with him since I think 12 hearts is too many already
tears*
you mean the thing epicbob is doing?
FallSpeed however makes the teara orbit you longer, it does not affect how far away from you the do
considering I don't know what you're talking about, probably not
<@145740433165647873> Is that hp limit removal thing part of your "console" or whatever you call it that you are doing for fun?
cause i don't think there's a way to tell if a container is given by the gullet
yeah thats what im thinking, im also trying to figure out how that would work with devil deals though
maybe try calculating the number of containers greed's gullet gives at a given moment, and then remove hearts if they are over that number?
no clue <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
ok wrong question lol, is there a way to actually make it so that HP upgrades dont work but items such as greeds gullet do?
No
did somebody say limt!?
can you remove hearts whenever you have more than the given amount?
does anyone know how to have a health limit similar to the keeper?
as in you need to add to it in order to decrease fall speed
falling speed is inverse i think
maybe PosOffset? Unsure how that works though :/
that*
Velocity doesn't eitehr, besides moving the tears slower
Range is a bit broad, but I did edit the FallAccel and FallSpeed and taht didnt do much
range?
Also hi guys wasn't very active this weekemd soz:D
Hey what attribute determines how far the tears orbit from you with tiny planet?
but idk if it's for AB+
im pretty sure there is one
is there an existing custom challenge script creator anywhere?
worked
hmm i think i found the solution, im wanting to use EVALUATE_CACHE
im using their POST_PLAYER_INIT code so im assuming it wont make any differences. im currently checking out the Siren mod just in case though
their stats are based off of their item and they have special tears
lol silas is a weird char, not sure you should use that as a template
alright, thanks
Well, I hope for the best of luck with you.
Ok.
so not entirely sure yet
well, right now im just experimenting to figure out my limits lol
What kinda character are you planning on making?
Silas... Not sure about that.
but it doesnt work
im using a mod named "Silas" and im essentially copy and pasting their custom character stats code
That's how I would believe I would learn if I took the time to learn LUA.
yeah
<@139904316495364098> Have you poked on other people's characters to see how they did it?
does anyone know how to change custom character stats?
nvm got it
for custom challenges?
is there some way to start with a specific rune?
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2874/the-binding-of-g
it just plays the animation, and then spawns a poop that always drops either petrified poop, or a golden heart
for some reason i can't change a poop to a rainbow poop
alright thanks, got it working I think
thats my current code, the if statement returns true but the stats dont change
```
function mod:PostPlayerInit(player)
    if player:GetPlayerType() == char then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - .5;
    end
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, mod.PostPlayerInit);```
hey, how do i change custom character stats?

in fact, let's look at the Ultra Hard chlallenge in challenges.xml, that we know goes to mega stan
It's a number not a string

what do
so when I type endstage="megasatan" it doesnt end at mega satan, it ends at moms foot
lel
Yeah don't trust the documentation comments to be of much use
this really doesn't help at all :p

i tried that as my second attempt
lol, when i first did it i was just using EvaluateItems without addcacheflags
thanks
i was using only addcacheflags, didn't know you had to use evaluateitems as well
ok
where the caceflag is whatever flag you want
ohhhh
```lua
player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE) -- Let the cache know to update the damage
player:EvaluateItems() -- update damage items
```
yes there is
so is there any way to force a re-evaluation of a specific stat cache?
not much
so maybe 42 or so total
just a handful compared to the 38 natural treasure rooms
HAAAAAAAAAAA (thanks)
yeah true, but I don't plan on making them that common
if every room is exciting then none of them are
that's all
I don't want to make the game easier per say so I want to add a bit of threat to the new rooms with options
KK, try validating your game cache
Essentially out of all the special rooms. Treasure / Curse / Sacrifice etc they are all a bit..... boring or underwhelming
<@!135254843567767552> sorry, I had to do something. I do not have a folder with "scripts" at all... so i might need a direct download or something ;P
well i've given my opinion
what I mean is I'd like to make one or two more rooms where that naturally happens
For the second time I understand that
thanks
that's how more options is though, ranik
inside your Rebirth install folder, tools/luadocs/annotated.html
btw, where is that page with that useactiveitem command on it, looks useful
you would always have free access to one. The other option might be key locked
eh, i don't think i'd like having to pay to get an item, and More Options already makes you pay for one of the items usually (i.e. one item inside 4 rocks)
Choice and Consequence vs More options and no consequence
rather than depending entirely on More Options
I know, I want to make the natural double room type a bit more common
I want to make more double treasure rooms but have an element of threat involved or pay (via keys)
there's already an item that does that tho
What do you feel is an appropriate level of threat for a choice treasure room? IE you can choose one or the other pickup
Question/Poll
new to lua in general idk how id go about that

i'm saying make it so everytime they start the challenge, for each trinket give them the trinket and use the smelter
how would I save the state of all the used trinkets then so you start with that
maybe you could add in a trinket and use smelter, then repeat for all the trinkets?
yeah it doesnt seem like it, tried manually adding in all of the trinkets and it just gave me the first one I asked it to spawn
don't think that the smelter's effects are available to us
does anyone know where the smelted effect on trinkets gets stored or whatever? I kinda want to make a challenge where you have every trinket effect, but I cant figure out how to
does player:AddCacheFlags re-evaluate a given cache? doesn't seem to actually do anything for me :\
wait i might know what to do
since currently when i pickup one at 99, it heals but then removes a coin
i'm trying to set up an interaction at 99 coins
99
well, how many coins do you have?
works for me at least
getnumcoins does indeed get number of currently held coins
you'd think, but it doesn't seem to work
does anyone know if player:GetNumCoins is how you check the players current amount of coins?
rip
when the dev is trying to help but kk doesn't respond
because i can confirm that removing or renaming or editing that file breaks everything for me
do you have `\resources\scripts\main.lua` ?
well let me ask
deleted resources.jp folders and stuff
reinstalled it several times
i have no idea what it could be, i made sure mei was the only mod enabled...
and that obviously causes any mod trying to load after the mod that breaks it to not work
i don't know how, but i've seen it
i know that some people somehow end up missing or someone ends up overwriting the functions in the main.lua like RegisterMod
do you have any mods installed in your rebirth/resources folder?
a lot of other character mods don't work for me as well
the peeping doesn't attack, and mei has no hair and doesn't have tears
mods like "the peeping" and "mei" haven't been working...
i've been having a lot of problems with isaac mods lately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKktr-sqPwc&index=6&list=PLMZJyHSWa_My5DDoTQcKCgs475xIpQHSF
here's a video on audio files, he might talk about it
say if you wana change the penny pickup sound effect
how do you change the audio files
hey
Rainbow Dip
oh good god
xD
the embodiment of beauty
ew what the hell is that

gorgeous
probably
it wouldn't surprise me if there was an issue with playertype's causing that
if it wasn't clear already I have no idea what I'm doing
it suddenly didn't need it anymore
naw i removed that actually
I'm guessing
?
id 41
so he had mei's hair
my character seems to inherit costumes from other mods
this is odd
so does anyone here know how to make my costume show up in-game? I've got it all there just not the coding
got it
I can try and make something real quick
unless tints are hard to do
just a blue tint for starters, maybe?
hm, I don't
also, if you've got a costume or effect that should happen to show it's active you could dm that to me
i don't have access to what falls under bullet in regards to infamy i suppose, but i'll make some assumptions
thanks dude
okay i'll just mess about in my test file then
woah sorry for wall of text
```
local Mod = RegisterMod("DinkMod", 1) -- Change the part in quotes to match your mod name
local game = Game()

Mod.Collectible_Protector = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Protector")

local Dink = { -- Change Dink everywhere to match your character. No spaces!
    SPEED = 0.1
}

local tearBool = 0

function Dink:onCache(player, cacheFlag) -- I do mean everywhere!
    if player:GetName() == "Dink" then -- Especially here!
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
            player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + Dink.SPEED
        end
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
            tearBool = 1
        end
    end
end

function Dink:updateStats()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if tearBool == 1 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay + 5
        player.TearColor = Color(0.6549, 0.6196, 0.8039, 1, 0, 0, 0)
        tearBool = 0
    end
end


Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, Dink.updateStats)
Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, Dink.onCache)
```
I have some but it's only for editing the character's base stats at this point
no code so far rogue?
It's here if anyone wants to take a look
just needs the code for it
I have the item's graphics made and stuff
@yatboim I would appreciate some help, yeah
do you think you could take a look at my main.lua, it uses add_null costume
but essentially yeah
ah
<@66197463593136128> well it would be limited to bullets
...so holy mantle?
want some help?
like really really easy
that's quite simple
and then the effect goes away
so basically it would block one bullet
all i want is something that gives a guaranteed mask of infamy effect, until you get hit
mei is still cool af tbh
what's it do?
I'm trying to make an active item but I think it's way out of my league
i can't realize the character how i want so it's a little disappointing, but thanks regardless
still impressive work dude
i'm not content with the workarounds i have to put up with and the lack of control i have over some aspects
antibirth api soon
it's a mess really, i want a better api
>that uncomfortable feel when something is working and you have no idea why
that is one hell of a mod
woah
you made mei?!?
it would crash if i tried to add costumes the way they added them in the custom player example
not default costumes anyway, i just addnullcostumed when the player is mei myself
absolutely not
also do you know how costumes work?
? though
one keen eye
oh okay then
wow... changing the quotes fixed it
but idk what other ids work right now
I know we shouldn't all use 41 because that causes conflicts
shot in the dark but try appending id = "41" before priority
I believe so
the first one has weird quotes around skin color , that might be causing an issue
costume issues?

Is there anything wong with these .xml files?
which is kinda hard
I have it in an uploadable state but it still lacks the active item i wanted to make
yes
don't see anything related to this mod in the log, other than the part where i spawned the item in
<@201091583553175553> IS THAT PROFILE PICTURE MR. DINK?
and if not, try putting a debug in the callback function to make sure it's getting in there in the first place
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
anything in the log?
just type in the always charmed seed when you have the mod on :kappa:
easy
i feel like i'm missing something obvious here... trying to make a specific entity always start charmed/friendly (spawning it is handled elsewhere and works fine, but it always shows up hostile)
hard to say, try checking the log
and a crash on startup could be a number of things
kms
>_<
the log is located in the same place mods go
where the heck is the log again
is a crash on start-up xml or lua related?
havent done this for a while
hey how do you check if an enemy is a certain enemy?
pretty useful
it can kill normally invincible enemies like peep's eyes
that new item, the little horn or whatever it's called
1000 Degree Knife - "Nothing Can Stop It!"
When used, it removes all stonies and grimaces in the room. This item has a 4 room charge.
im back!
i like <@240743817530179584> 's idea
bravo edmund
looks like it's broken anyway so I have to use this workaround somebody found
thanks
someone knows
if I had to guess, I'd say __yes__.
I'm trying to edit a character's starting tear stat
anyone know the cacheflag for tear delay?
gay
1000 Degree Knife kills all Stoney or Grimaces in the room
i just don't know *how* to type it out
like i know *what* to do
i just don't know what term i'd use to see if they've changed
```Lua
    for i, entity in pairs(roomEntities) do
        if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entity.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN and entity.SubType == CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY then```
i'm currently keeping track of them
keep track of the coins that do exist, and see if the number of them changes
what, no glowing? no experiment?
<@!83097725666590720> i figured, i just can't figureout what i would use to check if the coin is no longer existing
New mod 1000 Degree Knife
is there currently a way to do bit shifting? can't use bit32 ?
<@216324079504982016>  NO!
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be an angel
<:friends:260197422938980352>
at least, that's how i'd do it, might be another way
that's a difficult thing to do since there's no callback for pickup_consumable. You'll have to check for a coin existing and then not existing, and make sure that on that same frame the player has 1 more coin than the previous one
now if only i could make it see when i pickup that coin
now i have it so it heals me if there's a coin in the room
well
just had to reload the mod through the menu
Oh it was
that wasn't it
actually nvm
great
Oh I fucked up the priority
on Isaac
with no other costumes
any idea why even though I add the null costume it doesn't show
thinking about it
that was dumb, actually, wow
yeah, i kinda figured
that makes no sense
what
or am i missing something
this is defining the variable penny as a coin ingame, right?
Does this work?
hmm
how do you get base player stats?
luv u robo baby
I just need to check if a coin has been picked up or not, not even if it went into his coin counter
why is there no just "onpickup.EntityType"
damnit
are reset
ok so only those stats which are in the current cache flag pool
<@90940715076423680> returns an EntityPickup if the entity is a pickup, or nil if not
are stats reset before evaluate cache?
what does ToPickup() do, exactly?
uhm, i have a question about enabling achievements with mods... how do you do that on mac?
you still don't understand >.<
for example I have this under my speed cache ```if player:HasCollectible(ItemId.CPEPPER) and not HasItem.CPepper then
      if player.MoveSpeed <= MAX_SPEED - ItemBonus.CPEPPER_S then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + ItemBonus.CPEPPER_S;
        HasItem.CPepper = true;
      elseif player.MoveSpeed > MAX_SPEED - ItemBonus.CPEPPER_S then
        player.MoveSpeed = MAX_SPEED;
        HasItem.CPepper = true;
      end
    end```
otherwise items evaluate multiple times
so you need a negative feedback ``` and not HasItem``` attached to all of them
e.g. a damage up will re evaluate everything under the cache damage tab
ugh
no only those that the item corresponds to
and for each item, call evaluate cache with each of the flags
it goes through all
or does it go through all of the items
and *then* call evaluate cache once
yes
add all the cache flags from them
does it go through all of the items
what I'm wondering, is when you pick up an item
you can add cache flags to a player, like damage, maxfiredelay etc - like you probably know already
basically
I don't think you understand
as in when you pick an item up it checks the cache
what
it should just check it regardless
and then call evaluate cache
or does it first add all the cache flags from all the items
does it call evaluate cache for each item
when you pick up an item
no I mean
like this i```if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then```? yes
it first adds all the flags from items, right?
although now that I think about it
cache evaluate is called for each flag
on a cache evaluation
I want to only apply the effect of my item once in the evaluate cache
basically
still
i think i misinterpreted
fug I meant evaluated
was my question
you wanted to know whether things are being activated no?
`is there any way to check if the cache is currently being validated?`
and place a debug_text where you are trying to check whether something is activating
you got the wrong person I think?
where Everything is replace your mod name
<@268036083827212290> ```function Everything:debug_text()
    Isaac.RenderText(debug_text, 100, 100, 255, 0, 0, 255)
end```

```Everything:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, Everything.debug_text)```
now i need to figure out how to make it "see" that isaac has picked up a coin without it checking his coin counter cause then it wont work at 99
2000
<@193389830690963457> what do you mean
yes
so that thing you wrote, caleb, that checks the rooms for coins, right?
hmm
<@268036083827212290> chuck a debug text and render it under the item you're trying to check
you can
i think you can check for just red hearts
is there any way to check if the cache is currently being validated?
if getHealth(not the exact command) == current health then the player is most likely at full health
hmm
first mod i've wrote myself so i'm trying my best to figure this out :P
ideally, anyway
makes sense
ahhh
like healing from coins
it basicially replicates the effect of playing keeper
yeah mines called keepers noose
i like the idea
nah that's not what im tryin' to do
i like the idea
ah
no greed gullet adds extra hp
i hope not
not sure if thats what greeds gullet does
ahhh
im trying to make it so when you pickup a coin, if you're not at full it heals you but doesn't get added to your coin total
are you trying to make a greed gullet type thing
nah that's not what im trying to do
this removes all penny's and gives a random chance to replace it with a nickel
e.g. ```local roomEntities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i, entity in pairs(roomEntities) do
      if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entity.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN and entity.SubType == CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY then
        local pos = Vector(entity.Position.X, entity.Position.Y)
        local vel = Vector(0, 0)
        target = entity
        if math.random(18) <= 2 then
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL, pos, vel, player)
          target:Remove()```
i might have to do that
just do entity:Remove() to remove the one off the floor and spawn a heart where it should be
first
a coin
i need to see if the player picked up
i didn't do that right
nvm ignore that
wait
```Lua
    for i, entity in pairs(roomEntities) do
        if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entity.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN and entity.SubType == CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY then
            player:AddHearts(1)
            player:AddCoins(-1)
        end
    end```
the thing I put in scans for those on the floor
yeah it'll be to add a negative number
maybe its addcoin -1
is there not an aviable player:thing to remove a coin?
shit
its just the "random" emotes
it must be
it absolutely can be lol
no it can be
but then the info page
It can't be can it
i'm not entirely convinced its a bot sometimes
no idea
or logic?
is it just when I say common lua terms
i got one earlier
it is a mystery
why does robo baby do what he does
:P
i was hoping robo baby would rate me
yeah no i cant spell
dang
practise
oh i see
it can be whatever but its common practise to be i
i is just a variable used
thats where im confused
so, what exactly does for i, do?
```local roomEntities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
for i, entity in pairs(roomEntities) do
      if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entity.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN and entity.SubType == CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY then```
that's going to scan the room for coins, right? :V
```Lua
for i, coin in ipairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do```
Does anyone know what mod causes this?
Can someone help me? I'm having an issue with a mod (Or a couple maybe) causing all familiars to attack similar to bandage girl / meatboy. I'm not sure which one, and I've tried uninstalling them in groups, but I don't want to spend the time to through all 136 of them one by one.
and if it's not equal to the current one, call the function
then, in update, iterate for each key, check number of picked up collectibles of the ID
in the loop body, add keys to a table starting with 0
`break` if `IsValidCollectible` (from Config::Config) returns false on the ID
the basic idea is a loop with a variable starting from one
and works with multiple pickups
that passes the id of the picked up item to a method
generic on item pickup callback
for a proof of concept
btw I have an idea
¯\_(?)_/¯
suddenly it works
what the hell
this is well documented and has plenty of coustumes
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847639592
this one's pretty good
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847380821
here
uhh
you get the jist
example?
such as itesm instead of items or item instead of items
plenty
well something could be mispelled
is there any mod on the workshop with a functioning costume?
notepad++ isn't bad ;_;
hey now
I have syntax highlighting
trust me I'm not using notepad
whether it be a missing / or a > or a "
too
that's been my expierence so far
trust me crashes are *ALWAYS* due to xml errors
ah okay
I literally copied a costume anm2 and changed a layer PNG
no the () are closed and the == is what your looking for
2000
<@193389830690963457> it's not an XML error
so i would specify the entities im looking for in the ()?
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-22_16-04-08.png
string or int
what are teh outputs
like Isaac.GetRoomEntites(hearts)
right?
getroomentites is a table, so i'd specify the entites i want to look for in its paranthesis
crashes are always due to XML errrors
crashing with AddNullCostume ?
and Isaac.GetRoomEntities?
so GetVunerable == false
check for entities but the non vunerable ones
if i wanted to scan the room for consumables on the ground, would i use GetRoom?
No idea why
Ive played one run of ab+ before uninstalling it yet i know all the item effects
le nerdy
"Science!"
i hate its description
I know like 3 items in afterbirth+
i didn't even know that item existed lol
oh rip
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Little_Horn_(item)
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-22_15-43-54.png
thats what they're called
Blisters
no idea
how are they called?
I barely played afterbirth+
the new ones
i know the spiders can fire them
are Little Horn tears used anywhere?
is the creator of the garden in this discord?
Happens
<@!173420370773147649> how the hell did I not notice that message
it's actually on death
ok nvm
oh that's the actual name of it coding-wise? cool
Told you so
it's on hit
it hurts
that's how the tear flag is called
Euthanasia
GOT IT
that shoots out tears when the player gets hit, not sure if that's it
<@142496152770576384> I don't know
The on-hit thing?
<@268036083827212290> you mean varicose veins?
aka needles/syringes
Euthanasia
not sure if it's on hit or on enemy death
what's the tear effect that causes your tears to shoot out tears in 8 directions like sad bombs?
don't wanna muddy up any of these channels with sprite after sprite... lol
xD oh christ. <@223869207748542464> if you'd legit want to, feel free to add me! I've got to head to work soon, but maybe I could privately send some of my item sprites/item function notes/ideas and we could do a few
uguu
now kiss
well isnt this just lovely
? awh
that was fast
i can help you ;D
Sweet, I figured as much. That makes me really happy to hear
i'll do it when the antibirth api is out though lol
just wait a bit and someone will most likely pick it up
relatively common
I'm getting into sprite art/animating it, and I have no coding knowledge. Just wondering how common it is for people on this server to collaborate
god dammt
and i would but i'm not touching the ab+ api with a fifty foot pole
oh...
like i said, it isn't for ab+, just afterbirth
figured
Sorry I shouldn't use "mod" synonymously with "code"
<@66197463593136128> it didnt work ?
i think 85%
100% someone would make sprite for 1 item, but more idk
is Nicalis gonna work on making the whole modding thing easier also
Hey I'm not trying to drag anybody's attention away from other questions, but out of curiosity... how high of a chance is there that somebody would mod a sprite for you here?

Like, if one wanted to split even on credit and make a small item pack of ~15-20 items, would it be hard to collaborate and get something going?
the mod isn't compatible with ab+ yet fully ?
Guess I will have to delete them every time I add a new mod then
alright
no
doesnt it work if I send the folder that holds them instead
yeah just drag everything from the zip in to that folder
all the files to it?
and if it does it will be with limited capacity
it won't work for ab+, however
just throw the files in there
use ``FireKnife(Entity Parent, float RotationOffset, boolean CantOverwrite, integer SubType)``
Do I import the godmode folder directly to resources or just the files of godmode to resources folder?
I installed godmode
unzipped it as a folder
what now
http://prntscr.com/dyzflp
does it have a velocity vector in it?
have you tried Spawn()?
how to spawn something at a position and shoot it out
Can't figure out how to make knife synergy work with my mod ?
Anyone? :/
http://prntscr.com/dyzflp
what now
unzipped it as a folder
I installed godmode
no I mean one that i installed
you just subscribe to them on steam workshop
Can anyone help me to install a mod
when did they add synergy for brimstone and mom's knife
UH
and holy shit there are so many awful rooms so early in the game
finally added tech synergy, working with EntityLasers was weird lol
and fixing them for a no shitty rooms mod
I'm looking through all the rooms in the basement right now
well that wasn't obvious at all
https://files.catbox.moe/ybytvx.mp4 4 for shooting, 2 for moving, 6 for both
you're just wrong though
so it fails if you are doing both at the same time
it'll return moving instead
If you are shooting AND moving,  it won't return shooting.
No it doesn't.
getlastactivetrigger works fine and as expected
^_^
with this, I can make the rest
fine
and -1 when not shooting
FireDirection is 0,1,2 or 3 when shooting somewhere
oh
cos it overwrites shooting with moving
had tons of problems before with GetLastActiveTrigger etc
np
thank you
ok
just check if FireDirection is not -1
ignore what anyone else says
yeah
can someone help me with detecting wheter the player is shooting, so I can make a maw-of-the-void-esque item?
i dislike the name alphabirth but the mod actually seems rather cool. wish i could see more of the items though(don't have ab+).
*smaller*
its duke of flies, but
jack of flies
edmund retweeted some with a new enemy tho, maybe go look at that ?
well, alphabirth adds one, but it's a dip variant so it's pretty simple xD
Are there currently any mods that add new enemy alternates?
The barry of benson: Beebirth
the birth of birth: rebirth
solely multiplayer isaac dlc
the binding of bisaac: bibirth
abortion
godbirth
I'm kind of tired of the -birth naming scheme
perhaps. Its Team Alpha's mission to produce biweekly quality modpacks.
Is Alphabirth  the Antibirth of AB+?
I did
so, has anyone here tried Alphabirth? c:
I guess there (will be) a lot of devil and angel items (along with religious iconography and nerdy shit
Doesn't quite have the ring I imagined
"CalebG's Isaac Modpack"
The Mudding of Isock
There's no specific theme
I've been formulating a modpack for a while now and slowly adding to it, however I'm still to come up with a good name, anyone got any good ideas on what I could call it.
I just uploaded my steam mod to the Modding of Isaac page.
<@223869207748542464> ;-;

offtopic and slow

finally adding brim/drfetus/tech synergy for my mod ?
Neat
for some reason it worked this time
Changed subtype
How'd you get it to work <@123925872573939714>?
hem
but the thing is that some books doesn't work
and then he replied with a working version
yeah but I asked kube
thanks for the help <@!83097725666590720>
Holy shit
I figured it out
fuck ? xd
Oh wat ?
i already responded with the fix, <@182519885669072906>
But some of the books doesn't work
So I tried to add a new book that just active a random book effect upon use
Hey guys
this one
wrong one
wait no
I already tried changing subtype (did nothing) and variant (caused it to not spawn)
What do I change?
(assuming the api allows for that)
might have to use code to find the roomID and place it in that when they find it
hmmm
<@90940715076423680> specific room
it just didn't spawn
I tried to
wonder if changing pedaastals to 5.1000.itemd would work?
Like making a new treasure room
Unless the room you want it to spawn in is specific
Well you can always isaac.spawn it <@123925872573939714>
No problem
I still can't figure out how to make a specific item appear in a room
Thank you. ?
In there is, among other things, the path where you need to store mods
In the game's folders, there is a file called savedatapath.txt
Quick question, where do you install mods manually for Afterbirth Plus on Mac?

Remove all doors in a room
How do you make people want to quit
And I can't really get anything done to the end
I don't really do anything noteworthy for others and just make people want to quit
Well
Why?
I think I might just quit Isaac modding
oh
they don't require much, this is all i need to put in my xml to make a challenge:
```xml
<challenges version="1">
    <challenge name="Loose Cannon" endstage="10" altpath="false" canshoot="false" roomfilter="4" playertype="4" startingitems="190" />
</challenges>
```
Are they hard to make if you know? Got no exp in modding
you gotta create your own challenges.xml in modfolder\content
ah damnit
I cant remember
there isn't one, as far as i know
It is a thing right? and im not just dumb
Do you know where the program to create challenges from afterbirth+ is?
That way ->
sure
point me in the right direction for something
Could someone
It's fine now
do you have character mods ?
RIP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qnd-hdmgfk
my game crashes when I try to disable mods, lol
fuck
interestingly Hush didn't seem to have any hardcoded elements given that Godmode managed to replace it
haven't actually tested that yet
at least that's my theory
I see
so they can replaced by room edition in theory
I see
??? and Isaac are just a normal boss entity
tbh i figured Satan was hardcoded because of the whole Fallen spawning and Satan spawning after fallen dies
You could use that
Godmode has an angel in place of Blue Baby tho
Yeah well it does some kind of replacement
and other enemies
which is a fusion between Mom, It Lives
Agony has Mom's Soul
Was it Agony then that had that Angel boss in place of Blue Baby ?
yeah it replaces Lamb with 3 reskinned Adversaries
It replaces other hardcoded bosses, it's the same
it just seems to replace the first phase with a reskinned Fallen
i think Godmode doesn't replace satan
I guess you can try to see how Godmode does it
Oh well that's RIP haha
i don't have AB+ tho lol
That's very easy to do
You can still write a Lua script to catch a Satan spawn and replace it with something else
But it's not the same thing
Well Godmode replaced hardcoded bosses
I can't be the only person who thinks that looks like an enemy from Kirby
or if it's hardcoded in the game
i dunno if you can actually replace Satan with another boss tho
Hahaha even more satanic than Satan
imagine a boss based on that....
i meant those horrible things
Alright, thanks
...
Don Camillo ? #noonewillevergetthat
I don't think you can <@123925872573939714>, not with only the room editor
like a boss Camillo instead of Bloat
i feel like some of my bosses ideas may be even worse than the ones they're replacing....
using the room editor
How can I make a specific item spawn in a room?
Hahaha in that case it's fine
sorry i can't seem to type anything right these days
whoops
i meant less useless
i fucked up
wait
Making rooms harder is alright, but no cheap shit like making good rooms worse
That's just ... no
maybe make some bosses to replace some of the usually hated bosses (Haunt, Bloat)
eh, unless i can make decent sprites, it will mostly rework the rooms and make them harder or make stuff like sacrifice and curse rooms less useful
Depends on what the mod does haha
but dunno if that's a good one
was thinking of Binding of Isaac: Overcharged
i need to find a name for my mod
You define it with : though
not  mod:functionname
you have to put it as mod.functionname
You should use that (only consider the bottommost text)
hold on brb
In `My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+` (not the mods directory), there's a log.txt file that contains Lua errors among other info
the function i want to call is "Mod:ActivateVoidShard
Yeah but for somereason it doesn't want to work.
You use `your mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, function you should call, your item ID)`
Im gonna uh... send the code i guess or something? I dunno...
I think idk how to modcallback.
Yep.
it reads a function called "VoidShardUse" when the spacebar is pressed.
Like, ive already written it so uh, it "detects the item" , but the thing im mostly confused about is that how do i make it like...
still kinda new to this coding thing and, ofcourse, im trying to make it so 3 friendly gapers spawn. but right now i think i just ran into a wall or smth
Yep
So uhm, mat.
instead of having a damage scaling boss, how about having a boss that either moves around fast or teleports so it's hard to inflict lots of damage on him quickly
i was thinking of something for a Hush replacement for my mod
Makes sense
probably a hassle
it may be possible but don't ask me how
head is just isaac's base
0-3
which is why there's 4 layers
and I think it just uses 4bits or something?
everything is saved in bits and shit
from what I understand
uh, we can't
Can't we create more head layers or are they not rendered ?
Haha sure is
but c'est la vie
for some reason some items that really shouldn't be head3 are head3, so it can happen that you just run around with no head and a floating cyst sticking to your face
the hat and glasses are head3 so as long as nothing edits that, he will always have the hat at least
Gotcha
so some items that add stuff to head0, head1, head2 also add his head
I see
some items add heads, like mom's lipstick (because they were lazy with it)
and isaac shows up as soon as something edits the head base layer
Alright
oh of course
gonna have to some testing with bosses
Is it intentional that there's no Isaac in it ?
I dig the costume haha
Alright seems fair
damage up, speed down
something something enemies are confused if you stand still
What's the use of it though ?
Niiiice hahaha

Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I wasnt here.
uhh...
whoops
oh shit
what is it
It's good enough to find what you need for the most part, in a addition to looking at other peoples mods
Oh, right. that...
You should have a local version of the ab+ modding API docs in your tools folder in the isaac game directory
Hm, where can i find a good lua tutorial for starters ab+ video/documentary/idk
Yay!
Hm.
I tend to prefer text over video though, for this kind of things
As with most people yeah
He's an useful dude.
I'm learning from Lytebringer.
What you should do is read a Lua tutorial for starters x)
Damnit, i should really stop with that.
like... 4? 5?
wait how much have i said "its time to lua" already
alright its time to do advanced lua while being a basic lua-er
Actually read the doc next time x)
Oooh. Niiiceeee.
Fortunately the doc has a "debugging with ZeroBrane Studio" section that you can read
alright its time to lua
like... a lua debug menu or something.
debugging*
debug would make trail and error easier though
If you don't, you're better off just leaving
Everybody practices it, too
Trial and error is a religion here
trial and error?
The best of them all
More precisely, in the realm of badly documented APIs
Welcome to the fabulous, amazing world of programming
...this is gonna be a long day.
even though im practically clueless *ha ha ha*
Lua it up
Owye
anyways its time to lua the shard boys
You better not x)
But im not revealing what its supposed to do.
I got that much haha
Yeah it's neat
Its supposed to be a crystal shard...
i really like the look of it actually.
Scaling is up to you but it shouldn't change the shape
Well I'm only talking about the shape haha
its a bit small :<
Yeah sorta
does this look like something that would belong in binding of isaac?
Well Robo-Baby sure seems to like it ?
No vocals though, only mad technique ?
It's metal, I should say
Do what you want with it ?
https://soundcloud.com/matrefeytontias/circular-permutations
The first track of an upcoming EP, so I'm super happy about it
ayy ?
Not sure where to put this, but I published a track yesterday
heh, only lua i made is unitale stuff
well, i mean average lua. i only know basic lua.
the only thing im sad about is that i dont know how to lua
i mean the only thing that i'm sad about is the fact you can't modify enemy patterns aside from repeating the same event several times in one animation
tbh for now i'm fine with the AB modding
I'm working on a mod too, and i'll probably put it up somewhere for people to download.
got my first mod released yesterday
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847380821
im not complaining lol
they didn't really focus on the actual game content.
^ ?
the problem with ab+ is that they mostly focused on the "modding" part of things.
I just slaughter them
if I meet them anywhere after depths
sister vis is death
only once early on, which is just instant game over
i've not met them much at all
NOTABLY fucking Sisters Vis
and tbh all ab+ do is add 3 bullshit bosses
don't have enough cash left in my steam wallet
why dont you have ab+ lol
i can't edit the attack of that enemy without AB+
psy bloat
you know what would be cool actually
it's pretty much gonna be a reskinned and tougher version of that enemy
yeah, things should be predictable and you should have time to dodge
man i hate that guy
but dont make it stupid like the bloat
yeah, i agree
That boss sounds pretty cool, would be a pretty awesome idea
damn, 185 subs already lol
altought i think Godmode had a replacement for The Lamb
can't remember if you can replace the final bosses without AB+
or maybe even a Isaac replacement if i can
probably will keep it as a womb boss
exactly why i said it may be a bit evil
the hitscan could be a bit rough though
could work
but reskinned and with more health
i was thinking of making a boss based on them
you know the black cloud like enemies with one eye that shoots tech lasers ?
i also had a boss idea that may be a bit evil
can't remember either tbh
i can't remember if you can fly by those
Maybe angel / devil statues?
that's about the only option that isn't cheesed by flight tho
doesn't really stop them
Hey, uhm... How do i make an active item that makes it so when you use it, it spawns 3 infinitely charmed low tier enemies? (as in the gapers)
that just delays the person from getting it
hmm
<@128874748041101312> godmode
since you can't fly over them
you could have horfs or similar static enemies guarding the items
<@268786368048660480> which mod?
in certain areas
flying characters can ignore all barriers, I wish there was a way to block flight
yeah
the problem with that is flying characters
I can't they ask your previous password
one thing i was thinking for treasure rooms in my mod is having at least one guaranteed item, but have other ones in the room that either need resources or are guarded by enemies
change your password
I am always connected
<@255386131955187714> how will you play isaac on steam if you don't remember your password?
and curse / sacrifice rooms actually a bit more rewarding rather than just utterly ignorable
I don't at all want to make the game easier with mine. If anything I want to make treasure rooms a bit more varied in choice but make you have to take on mini-bosses inside of it to get them
if i even get the motivation to work on it that is
idk yet what i'll do with curse rooms in my mod
I most likely will create some alternatives similar to the originals but with at least a consolation prize
<@&205855326266720256> Hello, I got an issue with your site, since i don't remember my password, so I can't download mod, can you please send me the download link of one mod ?
does anyone know how costumes work and would be willing to look at my main.lua real quick?
you could remove the other curse room layouts or increase the weight of the item one
yeah bob that's what gets me, it's just a bit too rare for those rooms
Someone can send me a download link of godmode mod
but it's pretty rare
curse rooms have a chance of getting a devil deal item IIRC
lol
keeping in theme with isaac. If you've got a choice, you'd better be lucky or pay for it in sweat blood and lots of tears
but that seemed like overkill for characters with flight. They could just grab everything freely
I saw someone on the steam workshop had a variety special room mod
I want to basically make a little risk vs reward mod that adds a little spice to the current special rooms. Treasure seems a little too boring, curse and sacrifice rooms are largely useless from what i've seen (or from my bad luck lol)
derp <:isaac_surprised:245063314873253888>
Apparently it's far easier to just duplicate one of the existing double treasure rooms and modify it
oh xD
Not a modder
Idk
really?
Priority 1001
priority 99 doesn't work ?
how do I make my costume go over items like technology?
I was just pointing out the health situation
Hm
Easiest way for me to test it out
<@203215784770535424> That's just my item, the point is about the items it spawns
I hadn't noticed that
So it converts all your red hearts to soul hearts ?
interesting. I'll give it a shot
Works just fine
https://streamable.com/ubm57
Check the Boss Rush rooms maybe
gotcha I thought the option might have been in the room editor
I can try in a sec
I haven't tried it myself
Though that's just a theory
When you pick one up, all others will disappear
If you have N pedestals with TheresOptionsPickup=true
I think it's really simple
in lua
try it out
how do I apply that?
so, when you pick one up the rest dissapear
Haven't tried it out myself yet, but I imagine that it will work as a more options pickup
hmm
http://i.imgur.com/MHrx3l3.png
What about this attribute for pickup entities?
lol yes it would. But that'd be a bit OP for what I want to be a one off occasion
That would make it easier x)
You can also actually give the player More Options
hard to make it so you can only take one or the other
I figured
it's easy to put lots of items
Yeah that's the part I'm not sure about
Oh, making them disappear I don't know though
Yeah, you only have to actually place items there
I don't want to make it so that the player can pick up both. Just one or the other
Hello, Using just the room editor, is it possible to make some treasure rooms that act like the player has More options? I'd like to spice the treasure rooms up a bit by spawning a miniboss/boss + a pair of treasures the player has to choose from.
Yeah right
And this could've gotten far
People making assumptions and trying to educate others based on what they came up with is what leads to people raging at stuff that's working perfectly fine
Huh
And every subsequent require returns the previous return value
It only runs the script once
There's one more difference from what you said
Then it'll execute it and return the script's return value
It's what it's gonna be used for.
The general idea is that when you do `require "asdf"` it'll try to find a file called `asdf` or `asdf.lua` or `asdf.dll` in a few directories, including the working directory
It's more complicated than that
A Lua function
It's a Lua built-in that allows you to include the source code from other files
Whats Require?
For now, that is
Sure is
Yeah, but hey, it's better to have non-functional require than viruses, right?
wish require worked :c
gah
Plop
Ughhhh.... How about 4
Close enough
3 is white
I'll try it
ok
Uhhh... 3 i think?
what number is skin color green?
Aw hell yes
Waiiit... Infinite item charges...?
Thank you. It's also in the item pool
in the console, and then smash that spacebar
g d6
debug 8
Is there a way to check if your item actually spawns in the item pool without having to restart over and over hoping to find it in the treasure room to make sure?
have you checked the log?
how would you add flying costumes?
gn
anyway good night
Not everyone has to make over the top items or modes
And if not, that's also cool
Don't worry you'll get there
well, everything's a massive challenge to me at least
So I'm sure Bomberman is not hard
or maybe the ability to throw bombs idk
Kube senpai made fucking Tetris
lowkey that shit wouldn't be hard to make
add flying bombs to compensate
lmao
make sure you go hardcore and make it so they can't fire tears
it has to do with bombs
but here's a hint
;3
don't spoil my new character
gn
I eagerly await the first legit bomberman mod
going to bed you guys have a great night
(just kidding I won't)
now I have to respect you actually
oh damn you're actually mod a here
if it isn't limt
well well well
hehehehehe
so I just kinda waste my fucking time
"I don't even have an idea for this"
I'm drawing sprites at times and I'm just like
I know the feeling
hey man
oh well
instead of being a cheap piece of shit
I feel pretty stupid for wasting my ENTIRE DAY trying to do it alone
welp, after a bit of copy-pasting my costume's working
thanks for the tips
hm
Bear in mind, transparency in the lowest head layer makes Isaac's head disappear
head is the lowest, head0 is layer 1, goes up to head3
This is also a good way to set layers for your item, btw
Np man
Heh
thanks
why am i not surprised
The most reliable way is to just edit it in Notepad++ and remove the line that lists the spritesheet path
It's a little weird?
Uh
how do you remove a spritesheet from the animation editor?
I downloaded a few when I was trying to figure my own out
Next one's coming up
It was an early idea for a character
pandora's cool too
And a couple other items
I made the Bone Bundle and Pandora
your profile pic was similar I guess
oh
I did not, actually
<@122753000564326401> did you make that siren mod? that was great
thats a cool item
woah
but luckily I could just scroll up and download that zip file I posted

I almost freaked out because I accidentally deleted all my mod shit to start fresh and it didn't show up in the recycle bin
8 is too generous
and edmund usually only lets you donate 8
I've still never played as keeper because he takes 999 coins to unlock
i couldn't get it to work
from console?
wait can you spawn stuff on a pedestal?
ah the dot
spawn 5.100.itemid
trying to make a gif to show it off
pedestal
do you want to spawn it on a pedistal or just give it to yourself
like just the id seems to spawn the wrong items
and then?
spawn 5.100?
I forgot
how do I spawn an item per console again?
...if that's even possible
well on keeper i want it to give him another coin heart
its fine for keeper cause he sucks
so you have to sacrifice some hp for it in the first place
it was gonna be a devil deal item
¯\_(?)_/¯
that sounds kinda op
its supposed to give you keepers heal from coins ability
well thats only the start of it :P
seems cool
don't add heart
if you have more than 3
add a heart
if you have equal to or less than 3
i'm trying to make it check if you have 3 total heart containers
i think its because i messed up the math function im trying to do
only for isaac
wow
maggy, cain, anyone
as any other character it does not give them a health up
no like
as in player 1?
reason*
but it only works on isaac for some reaosn
i made my item finally do a health up
this is difficult
dang
unless the api decides to not work (which is possible from my experience)
yeah
right?
only work on isaac
that would make it
but added in Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

so if i were to make an item that added a heart
ey
yes
because he's 0?
that's getting isaac only, right?
if i do Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
question
working from examples is helpful :>
eh, why reinvent the wheel, we might as well have a standardized implementation of common things like "how add costume to item"
it's hard to get into the spirit when things that should work just don't
not really in the modding spirit huh
or at least part of its code
I don't think I'll ever know what the issue was but I don't really care, I'm cannabilizing this guy's mod
and it just werked
just copypasted the costume to a mod that I knew worked
lol
if i reduce tear falling speed they fall faster
um, what?
just need to lazily rip off costumes already in the game and call it done i guess
item is pretty good though, does decent damage
it's a FEATURE
so why is it that circle shockwave goes through invuln frames? idk, and i don't want to know
okay then
if i use the circle shockwave i insta-die, but if i use any other shockwave it's fine
sounds like it's only based on hp being lost
oohhh that's weird
i figured it wouldn't
doesn't proc on holy mantle either
maybe holy mantle, lets see
durr
oh
well book of shadows stops the item from proccing because you never take damage
failing that pyromaniac is an option
so you'd still need a real solution
insta kill unless you happen to have a shield
i mean that wouldn't be what the item's meant to be
lets see
...maybe
book of shadows or something?
you die instantly, i haven't found a way to survive it
weird
yep
<@68232539621298176> the rock waves hit through your invincibility frames?
no prob
like i have an item that spawns a rock wave in a circle around you when you get hit, but because i can't figure out how to make it not damage you, you just instantly die and about 40 rock waves spawn each frame
anyway thanks for your help
lol
my mod hardly functions as intended, most of my items either have no function or instantly kill you when they proc lel
but I must've screwed up somewhere
because I feel like I mimiced this other mod with a working costume perfectly
hopefully it works out
which sounds like a lot but it's really only like 10 files anyway
I'm on the verge of just rebuilding the mod from scratch and hoping it decides to work
and the lack of things like being able to intercept certain actions (floor gen, consumable pickups, etc) makes it really hard to do what i want
which is sad since the game itself is usually pretty darn consistent
yeah i'm pretty sure everything is being quietly stacked on top of some serious spaghetti code :/
i haven't gotten range to work at all either
i'm finding a lot of stuff with the api to be inconsistent, like trying to add tears upgrades and stuff
might as well
try it in content then, cards worked from there
right where everyone else puts it in mods that actually work
code looks fine though
it is in resources already, unfortunately
may be a similar problem
i had an issue like that earlier and it turned out it wouldn't read the anm2 from content for a new enemy, had to be in resources
here's the whole main.lua
```
local Mod = RegisterMod("MrDink", 1)
local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/dink_extra.anm2")
local char_costume_applied = false

function DinkCostume:OnUpdate()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  
    if (not char_costume_applied) then
        if (player:GetName() == "Dink") then
            player:AddNullCostume(Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/character_dink.anm2"));
            char_costume_applied = true
        end
    end
end
 
Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, DinkCostume.OnUpdate);
```
thats weird
just never shows up on the character
looks fine in the editor
I have the anm2 file made and all
yeah
not the one i was using to test?
you're using your own costume right?
hmm
if I set it to the character it's supposed to be, he isn't invisible but he's still not wearing the costume
and still no costume
if I try setting (player:GetName() == "Isaac") he's invisible
I'm about to just let it be
wew, still nothing
okay
yeah, that'll work
I'm really shit at this
so to initialize it as false, would
```
local char_costume_applied = false
```
work?
?
```
code
```
oh alright
its the character that appears when you do tilde (~) without shift, don't know what its called
'''
code
'''
no I don't
''' code '''
i get it
oh wait
'''like this
woops
like
` ` `
code
` ` `
just no spaces in between the `s
if you use three `, you can paste code blocks
seems much more convienient than pastebin
how do you post code like that in discord anyway?
no prob
i also used my own assets so you need to change those
ty
I'll give it a try
try using this, just initialize char_costume_applied as false at the top
```
    if (not char_costume_applied) then
        if (player:GetName() == "Isaac") then
            player:AddNullCostume(Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/flamehead.anm2"));
            char_costume_applied = true;
        end
    end
```
im not sure how you're supposed to do it normally but this method seems to work
ok i found a work around
http://pastebin.com/HqdN92TZ
something like this? I still couldn't get it to work
I don't really understand callbacks too well yet
I'll give it a try
because then you can add your costume on frame one
have you tried using the onupdate callback instead of cache evaluation?
I hate to keep asking, but does anyone see something wrong with this main.lua for the addition of a costume? it's stumped me
http://pastebin.com/d6kUn4gJ
I'm not sure either
i dont really know, otherhand was asking about it
do rooms have unique IDs associated? because in that case it would be a question of mods overlapping
like more rooms in the room pool
<@68232539621298176> what do you mean by room mod?
and i wouldn't be surprised if you can only use one room mod at this point
how would you even add explosion immunity? i've ben looking and i haven't found anything :\
does anyone know how to handle adding rooms? do i need to overwrite the entire stb in my mod, and if so, doesn't that mean it's only possible to use one room mod still?
thats great, thanks
they're considered explosions, only way to do that i think is explosion immunity (host hat/pyromaniac)
does anyone know how to make rock waves not damage the player?
maybe negative values could work
^this^
have you tried "AddMaxHearts" with the value -1 ? maybe nicalis thought thats a good method to do this thing ?
does someone know how to remove hewart containers without creating an item just for that? I know there's the function `AddMaxHearts`, but I don't see a `RemoveMaxHearts`nor a `SetMaxHearts`
thank you!
Good work with your future endeavours <@90940715076423680>
4 am is not great
Alright I'll be going to sleep
fair enough
lol
You can read as well as I can
this? just to be sure
https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.3.3/
those images of grandmas asking how to download the internet
it reminds me of like
haha
ohh okay
As I said, it's the name of the language and also of the interpreter
Google -> "download lua"
Like, really
It's called Lua
You do yeah
need a program for that?
It's the name of the language and of the interpreter
don't i like
Well, Lua xD
while i do this basic tutorial thing
whats a good lua interpreter to use?
i did! im very happy
You did a thing haha
cool!
Yeah you did
i just was wondering if i did that part right
i figured
mhm
You're still not using `effectApplied` correctly
yea
At least the `GetMaxHearts()` part is
Yeah that's correct
dangit
```
    if player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.Item)then
        if player:GetMaxHearts() <= 3 then
            player:AddMaxHearts(2)
            if not effectApplied then
                effectApplied = true
            end
        end
    end
end```
If I have to tell you what a function is and you're trying to write a mod, you're skipping steps ?
is this using it correctly?
out of curiousity
fair enough
i think the other stuff i wanna do is way too far past what i am capable of
You can't do anything if you don't know that part
That's basic programming logic that we're teaching you here
i just wanna atleast get the heart part working :P
Before you do anything else
i'm going to
You should really read up that Lua tutorial I gave you
If it was a parameter, the word "integer" would be between the parenthesis
so what i want to do is
As you can see, the "integer" type is outside the function, meaning it's actually the type of its return value
ohhhhhhhhhh
im asking it for what the max hearts are
is there something about AB+ that breaks the old method of adding entity variants by using only entities2.xml and a matching anm2 file?
only isaac has that
i can't ask it for max 3 hearts because
Yep
right?
Hehe
thats what im doign wrong
wiat wiat wiat
wait
so i thought getmaxhearts(3) would be-
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-21_20-19-09.png
i thought that was the correct way cause it says its an integer
Let's see if you can fix it by yourself
Anyway, knowing that, what do you think would be the correct way to use it ?
There's that little documentation
Well with the Binding of Isaac API it's all trial and error anyway
so wait
that it will get you many errors
ass out of u and me!
you know what they say about assuming
too
thats what i assumed
I'm assuming full ones
wait does GetMaxHearts() return based on half hearts or full ones?
In your code you give it a parameter instead of using its return value
`player:GetMaxHearts()` is a function that takes no parameter and returns the number of red heart containers the player has
Well yeah, and you're also using GetMaxHearts wrong
Variables have types to know what type of value they hold
so then i must be using effectApplied wrong
noted
ah okay
A boolean is a variable that is either "true" or "false" and nothing else
a boolean is a type of variable that can have the values of `true` or `false`
right?
a boolean is just returning a true or false
and, just for my own memory
It's a function that takes an integer, the item's ID, and returns a boolean, whether or not the player has the item
No, that one you're using fine
oh okay
the one im misusing
You're using that one correctly
or rahter
right?
the function i'm trying to use is hascollectible
so
Shut up, that's too complicated for now xD
i get what you mean
ignore me
nah i kind of understand that
Dude x)
but that's probably too confusing
well, `function() = something` wouldn't work, but `function = something` would work by overwriting the function, since in Lua functions are just a type of variable
And the other way around
So your error there in your code is that you mistake a function for a variable
In the same vein, you can't give inputs to a box and expect it to output something
So trying to do `function = something` doesn't work
The fundamental difference is that you can't put things *inside* the machine
Then you're free to do whatever you want with that output, it's not linked to the machine anymore
You give that machine inputs, and it gives you an output
A function is a name you give to a machine
In that box, you're free to put whatever you want
i understand variables the most
A variable is a name you give to a box
not completely!
yeah, you're fine
You don't understand how functions and variables work do you haha
that's the opposite of what im trying to do, i don't want anyone to write for me, im trying to write it myself
Nope that won't work
really i get more annoyed at people that don't try to learn, and just want people to do everything for them
```lua
    if player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.Item)then
        if player:GetMaxHearts(3) then
            player:AddMaxHearts(2)
            if not effectApplied then
                effectApplied = true
            end
        end
    end
end```
so, this is right?
yay
nah you're good
Oh no don't worry
i'm just trying to learn
hopefully i don't give off that feeling!
i try not to be an ass, despite making ass cards
However long it takes as long as I'm available
same
Well as long as the other person isn't an ass trying actively to piss me off I'm fine with helping them
~~we're only nice while we still have patience~~
yeah, it means a lot to me to be able to ask stuff like this ?
and you're all so nice :)
learning is fun!
<`KeepersNoose.Item`, that is>
Well, that is, if the variable that holds your item's ID is actually called that haha
isn't learning fun
im learning!
ohh okay
like*
Yep
right?
ike this
Booleans are either "true" or "false", and since == returns a boolean, there's no point using it on booleans
if player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.Item) then
just
so just nothing
ah
And for booleans you don't need it
== is the test of equality
i was told == is asking the game
?
player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.Item) == true
You just check whether or not that's true
so
It's a method, thus a function ; it returns whether or not the player holds the item
oh, dang
No, again, it's not a variable hahaha
you can't set that
if picked up?
then set it to true
player:HasCollectible(KeepersNoose.Item) = False
Haha I know the feeling
trying to make sense of this documentation in my head
sec
... yes ? x)
so would i do
let me check that out
neat
oh okay!
See the docs for that
The `EntityPlayer` class has a `HasCollectible`method
This time, make sure that variable is defined at top level, like I did
but how do you check if the item is in the characters inventory?
oh
Something like
```Lua
local effectApplied = false

function mod:onUpdate()
    -- ... your code here
    if not effectApplied then
        -- apply the effect here
        effectApplied = true
    end
end
```
And check for that before applying the effect
Create another variable to hold whether or not the effect has been applied, and change its value once it's done
because once they get the item it will cause that effect
Both ye
you would need to do both
how, though, i don't know
easier way would probably be to check if i have the item
how?
probably could just have a variable in your mod for whether or not the hearts have been applied
it's funny to me lol
and make sure it only triggers once
i just wanted to make a gif of that
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-21_19-58-38.gif
oops
i'm not!
As I told you haha
are you checking if the player has the item?
that's kind of funny to watch lol
all instantly
i get this
at spawn
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-21_19-57-53.png
Great xD
i broke something
WOAAAAAAAH
You used a fictive `player.Hearts` variable that doesn't exist
i made that classic mistake
oh wait
the docs just specify an integer
remember to reference the docs to make sure you're using actualy functions/attributes, and reference your log to see what's causing errors
It should be `GetHearts()` to get the current red health, or `GetMaxHearts()` to get the number of red heart containers
There's no Hearts variable ?
or maybe GetMaxHearts
Oh yeah right, I forgot to tell you
thank you for the assist
should use GetHearts() instead of Hearts i think
Sweet
nice!
victory!
But 6 half red hearts are 3 full red hearts yes hahaha
it is
but in isaac hearts
Well 6 is not 3 xD
yeah
right?
so 6 = 3
i assumed it was
It is
i don't know..
are you sure player.Hearts isn't counting half hearts?
But that's weird
Yeah
right?
should be
if player.Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddMaxHearts(2)
    end
Make sure it's actually being called haha
or more likely: i did something wrong
it doesn't :x
yup
Yes
so, AddMaxHearts should add red heart containers, right?
`EntityPlayer::AddBlueFlies ( integer Amount, Vector Position, Entity Target )`
<@126147229030285312> Welp you forgot quite a few parameters there
oh god it's mook all over again
lol sorry
no your indenting just sucks
oh wait
well you're missing an end
nothing's spawning, flies nor poop
even if it's returning false, it should be doing the else case (3 flies, not 6) yeah?
<@126147229030285312> no flies are spawning at all right ?
dunno if they've fixed it with the last couple patches
Let's assume it is x)
would produce the same string of numbers
Weird
it was fucked up before
`math` is standard to Lua so I doubt it
are math.random() and RNG() still fucked up?
should i be using RNG:RandomInt
Because if you're checking equality against a float then no wonder it's never returning true
Are you sure `Math.random()` gives integers ?

yeah
It must not only be the Game
Did you move the retrieval of the player inside the function too ?
okay sweet, that made the fear work, but not the poop/flies
<@126147229030285312> ^
You actually want your for block to end there
You're missing an end after the first if
As I said
i intend it to spawn the flies and poop regardless of enemy
After the first if
Oh maybe you wanted to end your for statement earlier than that
Well using it with no enemy present would indeed have no effect
using the card with or without enemies present, no effect
hmm it didn't seem to change anything
I don't have all the functions' prototypes in mind but it looks fine to me
The rest looks good to me
just try it and if it doesn't fix it let us know
well, that is _a_ problem, no idea if it's the only one
The code that's outside any function will be ran outside of a game context, so those entities don't exist
it's probably more memory efficient even
ok, so my problem is just needing to move those into the function
do that inside of the function
^
<@126147229030285312> same thing I said to paige ; you can't retrieve the Game and the Player at top-level
I swear that hasn't always been there
Oh yeah there is
Since when is there an MC_USE_CARD callback ..?
er, don't do GetPlayer outside of the function
it shows up ingame just fine, but using it appears to do nothing

not really long
if it's really long use hastebin
yup
i think i must be missing something obvious in my card script, is it ok if i post it up here?
i would assume that setting that bool to false would let you give him more health, but i don't know cause there's no documentation nor have i messed with it
looks like if you set IgnoreKeeper to false, maybe
The answer to that question is in that screenshot hahaha
Is it possible to give keeper another heart/coin out of curiosity?
Also beware, you're not checking if the dude actually has your item
Ohh okay
Yeah there you go

AddMaxHearts should be health up
Nah I don't think it is
... or is it ?
`player:AddHearts(2)` just heals one full red heart, it's not a health up
You wanted it to be a health up right ?
Oh I know
less than or = too
er
if player:hearts is less than 6, then
give 2 hearts
i thought it would
hm?
Of course it didn't give you a heart
not at all lol
That's not centered haha
hmm
it didn't give me a heart
?
that icon looks like trash lol
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-21_19-25-14.png
woo!!
haha
i forgot about there
i changed it everywhere else
You didn't actually change it xD
i thought i fixed that OMG
oh my god
wait
`Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")`
?
Dude xD
```lua
local KeepersNoose = RegisterMod("KeepersNoose",1)
KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")

function KeepersNoose:onUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end

    if player.Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddHearts(2)
    end
end

KeepersNoose:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, KeepersNoose.onUpdate)```
the whole thing
lemme repost my code one more time
Hm
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-21_19-22-20.png
mhm
Is `items.xml` in a directory called `content` ?
items.xml is right, path to the icons are right, the code to spawn it should be working
everything's lined up
i dunno what it could be at this point!
hm
It is haha
thats also true
programming is very picky :P
Nah, it's only a matter of knowing how things work ?
so tricky!
Your Lua code should be `Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Noose of the Kepper")`
ohh
Yep
because the name isn't the same?
```xml
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive cache="" name="Noose of the Keeper" description="Greed is Healthy" gfx="noose.png" />
</items>
```
so this is wrong, then?
that's probably it
wait
Case-sensitive
It must be the same in both items.xml and main.lua
Are you sure you wrote the name correctly ?
i wonder if my items.xml is wrong?
but its still random items
i thought it might be because i named the mod folder itself not the same as what i defined (KeepersNoose) and so i changed that
still doing it
nope!
hrm
Yeah that should be good
sec
i might know what it is
there we go
```Lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)```
\`\`\`Lua
On the same line as the backquotes haha
i broke it
oops
``` Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)```
that's where i have the item id right now
entitySubtype,
Check the order of your parameters when you call `Isaac.Spawn`
its still spawning random items
strange
i see
Yeah
like this line: ```KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")``` is the same as ```KeepersNoose.hi = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")```
You could call it bhkfjfkfd
It's just a name and a value
Yeah obviously
ignoring readability
could i theorhetically name it anything?
Yes that's correct
And with that line, you give it a new member variable (called *attribute*) named COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE
right?
thus making it an object
because i defined it in local KeepersNoose = RegisterMod("KeepersNoose",1)
oh
The variable `KeepersNoose` is actually an object
You're actually defining a member variable there
Recognize that dot ?
so how come i don't have to put local before KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")?
Right ? Haha
its really hard but immensely satisfying when you get it right
i really like coding, and lua
No problem, I'm here to help ^^
Every function that requires an item ID can accept that as a parameter
thanks for helping me understand that :)
cool!
Yeah basically
Using `Isaac.Spawn` is pretty complicated, there's not a lot of explanation
i can refrence it whenever i want using KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOSE?
so by storing it as a variable in that line, and giving it itemidbyname
i see
Which is returned by `Isaac.GetItemIdByName`and you conveniently stored in that variable named `KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOSE`
"Keepers Noose"?
You just give it your item ID
to make it spawn my item specifically?
so what exactly would i put there?
lol
spawning a pedestool
Yep, you should have x)
so it's just
in the spawn
i didn't put anything back
```lua
local KeepersNoose = RegisterMod("KeepersNoose",1)
KeepersNoose.COLLECTIBLE_KEEPERS_NOOSE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")

function KeepersNoose:onUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end

    if player.Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddHearts(2)
    end
end

KeepersNoose:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, KeepersNoose.onUpdate)```
I bet you screwed the variable again haha
oh thats why
every time
it's just doing a random item
Code plz ? ?
oh wait
and not my mod :P
but it spawned mom's eyeshadow for some reason
it kind of works now
well
oh lol
You should be using two variables
But yeah, your problem is that you overwrite the object ID with that boolean
i didn't post the full thing :P
yeah it is
Maybe it's used later
Well, useless in this part of the code, that is
Well then the second variable is totally useless
which he obviously would not
well to check if isaac has the item on frame 1
And then in the onUpdate function, `GreenCandle.HasGreenCandle = false`, which I'm assuming is used to spawn the item only once
`GreenCandle.COLLECTIBLE_GREEN_CANDLE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Green Candle")` holds the item ID, which is an unique identifier used to, well, identify your item
See, in the code you just posted, there are two different variables
oh
That can't happen x)
For holding the item ID and holding a boolean
You're trying to use `mod.HasNoose` for two different purposes at the same time
should i be doing liike
wait
Well, notice that you're using the wrong variable
mhm
You're trying to spawn the item right ?
Oh I see
which worked
```lua
local GreenCandle = RegisterMod("GreenCandle", 1)

GreenCandle.COLLECTIBLE_GREEN_CANDLE = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Green Candle")

function GreenCandle:onUpdate()
    --Beginning of Run Intialization
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        GreenCandle.HasGreenCandle = False
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, GreenCandle.COLLECTIBLE_GREEN_CANDLE, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end```
the other mod i had done it in, although following a tutorial to try and understand basic passive items, did this
hmm
You should check the doc for `Isaac.Spawn` again
That's not how this works
As the `EntitySubType` argument too
Again, I'm not sure what you're wanting to do by passing `mod.HasNosse` as a parameter to `Isaac.Spawn`
it just doesn't seem to want to translate
but yeah, i used a similar method in another mod to make it spawn in the starting room on frame 1
i understand now :P
yeee
`Hearts` is a variable, not a method, so you need a dot there
```Lua
if player:Hearts <= 6 then
```
i see
OHHH
ohhh
am i?
oh wait
And you're still using a colon for `player.Hearts` haha
just for testing
i'm trying to make it spawn in the starting room
Why are you passing it as a parameter to `Isaac.Spawn` ?
I'm not sure what you're trying to do with `mod.HasNoose`
that's usually the case :P
there's probably something simple i'm still not getting
```Lua
local mod = RegisterMod("KeepersNoose",1)
mod.HasNoose = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")

function mod:onUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        mod.HasNoose = False
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, mod.HasNoose, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end

    if player:Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddHearts(2)

mod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mod.onUpdate)```
The push pin icon on the top right of your Discord window
Check the pinned post
like you did
with the propper syntax
how do i make it colored
i didn't change much, mostly just what you had said
Post your new code maybe, so I can look at it
I find Lua's syntax very weird myself so I wouldn't blame you
Yeah haha
i understand what you were saying
i still can't get it to work but
you would think
If not all haha
That should clarify most of your errors in your code
that makes sense
oh okay
So you know what syntax to use
The doc tells you when something is a variable, a method, a namespace, a class etc
So here, the value returned by `Isaac.GetPlayer` is an *instance* of the *class* `EntityPlayer`
The type of an object is called its *class* ; we say in object-oriented programmed (OOP for shorts) that an object is a *class instance*
i see
You would do that by doing `player:AddHearts(value)`
Remember that a method is a function that's related to its parent object, so you call it instead of giving it a value
Because it's an object, it owns methods, and one example of such a method is `AddHearts(integer)`
So when you do `local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`, `player` is an object of type `EntityPlayer`
`Isaac.GetPlayer(0)` returns the first player of the game ; now we see in the doc that this return value is of the type `EntityPlayer`, meaning that it's an object
As I said, `Isaac` is a namespace, so no colon but a dot instead
Let's take an example
Methods are called with the colon syntax
An object, as the name implies, has an identity, and thus can own methods (a method is a function owned by an object)
`Isaac.GetPlayer()` takes a dot and not a colon because `Isaac` is not an object, it's a name space, that is, a name under which you define functions that go well together
Don't get confused though
For now you only need to remember one thing : variables take a dot, and methods (that is, functions related to entities) take a colon
Going back to your code
okay, thank you
ah i see
This is for anything related to modding, being help or showcase
Yeah, you're right in the good channel
i wasn't sure if this was just for finished mods..
just to make sure, it is okay to post code here and ask questions and stuff, right? i don't wanna break any rules or step on any toes or anything
thank you :)
okay!
Just start from here and don't hesitate to experiment, practice is of the utmost importance with programming
https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html
Yes, there is a widely used Lua tutorial
i dunno where to read up on it. if you have any resources that would be extremely helpful!
It's () because it's a function and not a variable
It's fine if you don't understand object-oriented programming, but you'll have to read up on that
right?
since its an integer
but a ()
not an =
oh
Also, as I told you with my code, it should be `player.Hearts`, which is a variable, and you should be calling `player:AddHearts(2)`
That's valid for everything that isn't a game entity
what you're saqying makes more sense actually
i thought you define all your variables first, then you use them in your function
So there are no players and there is no game yet
i didn't know it mattered
The reason for that is that top-level code is ran outside of a game, when the mod is first loaded
oh you can't?
You can't define variables retrieving game entities (such as `Isaac.GetPlayer()` or `Game()`) at top level, that is, outside of any function
After that, there's something you don't understand about the API
good point
```mod.HasNoose = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Keepers Noose")```
First of all, you're defining mod:onUpdate and then using mod.Update instead of mod.onUpdate
for some reason that block is missing a line
oh wait
The logic is there, but there are several errors
it should give me another
and if im at or under 3 heart containers
that should spawn it on the start of the run
from what i understand
Let's see
so that's right, then?
```local mod = RegisterMod("KeepersNoose",1)
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
local game = Game()

function mod:onUpdate()
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        mod.HasNoose = False
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, mod.HasNoose, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end

    if player:Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddHearts = 2
    end
end

mod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mod.Update)```
and this would be the first item im writing purely based on what i know, not following a video or anything
im trying to learn as i go
nope
Do you have any knowledge of object oriented-programming ?
```Lua
function mod:onUpdate()
    if player.Hearts <= 6 then
        player:AddHearts(2)
    end
end
```
or even when to use :
im still not sure when to use . instead of :
thats what i thought but i wasn't sure
on the isaac.addhearts?
What you want is this :
Even then
defined
i should add i have local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
dang
Not at all
right?
this is functional
```function mod:onUpdate()
    if player:Hearts <= 6 then
        Isaac.AddHearts = 2
    end
end```

Feel free to playtest my mod and tell me what you don't like. I will be grateful if you do so. And I'm done for the day, so see ya all later.
unfortunately it never wants to give him a costume
character looks fine and everything but I just want his hair to be layered on top
still can't get it to appear
<@228680372215349249> I have been GRAPPLING with this stupid fucking costume for half the day
no idea but they get added to the rotation and their stats and stuff are shown
also, in my initial testing I found you don't actually need to specify an ID
huh. how does that work now?
they all work fine together
yeah
I mean in terms of not breaking the selection screen
I know they CAN work together because i have a few that happen to
<@228680372215349249> it depends on whether or not they decide to conflicting IDs and such
I feel like it is
Don't know if it is balanced, but I'm glad you like it!
Cleverly balanced indeed, I like it
Oh I see
I personally wouldn't call it overpowered
<@203215784770535424> The tear effect is based on luck, 30 luck for 100%, 10% chance otherwise. Each tear is 1/8 the damage, although each tear has some tear effects based upon their color. One of them is a holy light tear.
No idea, never tried
can multiple character mods be used together properly yet?
Although a bit overpowered I feel like
That's super cool
Yea that's really cool
cool mod <@124088844181045249>!
Oh
Don't know if I should keep it
Adding the holy light tear effect to tears results in that weird flash of light
like fireworks

Also, this is kinda pretty
It's like the definition of problem solving
(which is also fun to me)
oddly enough debugging is fun to me. It's like problem solving
unfortunately I can't figure them out
I finally found crash dumps
because I'm a lazy piece of shit
and I still can't get it to work
half of my current mod is just ripped or referenced from other character mods
¯\_(?)_/¯
too much to go through
man troubleshooting sucks
I guess it was kinda pointless
Just to show that you can absorb items
I didn't get why you spawned the money=power I geuss
oh
with some banned items
the rest is the same
No? You just start with void and absorbed tammy's head without being able to shoot
<@124088844181045249> how will it work when it's done? will every room spawn an active item or what?
and if I try using a costume that's already in the game like Judas's fez it just doesn't show up
https://streamable.com/l39v1
New challenge
thats whats stopping me
same
now this is just weird, when the game tries to apply the costume it crashes
so how would i go about checking if they're in the frame?
didn't work
i tried numerical
for my issue anyway
that might be the problem
do you know if the ids for costumes need to be numerical?
ohhh i see
are they di-
you just check the subtype
sure it could
except it wouldn't be able to tell if you pickup 1, 5, or 10
huh yeah that would work then
oh thats right you can
oh my b
oh
You can pick up coins at 99
I forget
do you push them away or do you pick them up
cause you can't pick them up
It's about the entities themselves
wait
nah cause they'd still exist
..It would
<@124088844181045249> well that still wouldn't work at 99
that wouldn't return what i need either
what about checking if coin entities that were in the last frame no longer exists in this frame
i dunno how to apply a costume at spawn
very frustrating
same
I have almost all the art done on my character mod but for some reason it's not applying a costume I need applied
but im trying!
same :P
I'm terrible at this
me either
dang
i dunno how you'd do a collision check
thats true
so it'd have to be a collision check
thats what i was just thinking
but that wouldn't work once you hit 99 coins
yee
maybe just a check for when your coin counter is incremented
coin count?
uhh
can i check the
wait
how would i even go about that?
well darn
<@90940715076423680> there is none, you would have to make your own
whats the trigger to see when the player has picked up a coin?
I'm trying to modify a character's base stats but it crashes every time I start as that character
is there a place to check crash logs?
amazing
i hope other people dont get that haha

when I would like the chest
But stage 11 still seems to only lead to the dark room
right :p
Also consistent with the enumeration in the doc
That seems more likely
idk, maybe the numbers that show up when you type "stage" in the console

its a general "adding stuff" kinda mod

what is the name of this project
does anyone want to be part of a team thats making a pretty sizable mod? we'd be looking for coders.
they don't want us to ruin their perfection
because it's already immaculate so why would anyone want to change it
nicalis doesn't give access to the content already in the game
yeah but there's no "remove his damage resistance"
Mod idea: Give Big Horn more health, but remove his damage resistance. Give Delirium damage resistance, but make sure he can't telefrag, goes a bit slower, and his attacks are easier to read.
It has a priority of 99, so I don't know what to use to test it.
Than I don't think my costume worked.
content
Do I put costumes2.xml in resources, or content for my character?
that may be a problem actually in case i run into an issue lol
Yes
i have the feeling of being the only one left that'll still mod without the AB+ API lol
any isaac updates?
Weba
Hi, I'm back!
Maybe make it so pennies = heal, nickels = half a white heart, and dimes = full heart container
Neat, I'll see if I can figure it out when I get home
That's how I would do it paige
ayeverybody!
I assume you'd just check for pickup, then add an HP amount and reduce coin count by 1 at the same time?
I thought of a neat item today, keepers noose, makes coins heal you but coins that heal you don't get added to your coin total
Would it be possible to have a consumable do something other than it's intended effect when you pick it up?
thank you ?
cool, thanks
(if removeOn is the same 0.1)
yes
Quick question, if I set Weight to 3 and I keep DecreaseBy at 1, will my item show up multiple times?
<@174505132292046849> 
if it's for existing items, basically copy itempools.xml from the game into modfolder\resources\
if it's for new items, create a itempools.xml file inside your modfolder\content\
the itempools.xml should look like this
```xml
<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="treasure">
        <Item Name="Item Name" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
        <Item Name="Item Name 2.0" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="1" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
    <Pool Name="shop">
        <Item Name="Item Name" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
    <Pool Name="beggar">
        <Item Name="Item Name" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
  <Pool Name="greedShop">
            <Item Name="Item Name" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
        <Item Name="Item Name 2.0" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="1" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>
```
you set the names for items in items.xml and for more poolnames check out the original xml file
Weight = how often this item spawns
DecreaseBy = i think this decreases the weight of the item by that number when you pick it up
RemoveOn = on what ammount of weight does this item stop appearing from that pool
does someone here have the link to the itempools editing tut for me? ^^'
hasn't let me down yet
i compare entities using their index and type variant subtype values
entities aren't gonna be the same memory address like ever
`e:GetLastParent().Type == 1` works, all good
`entity:GetLastParent() == player` doesn't work
how can i check if a tear is fired from the player ?
methamphetamine
yes
Meth ?

lol?
ayy i got the added animation working but my isaac crashed the next run
It's all a learning thing really, enough experience and you get the hang of it
and needs an int
Very true. Truth be told I'm kind of debating not getting into the coding side and just kinda hopefully recruiting one or two folks from here in the future to work on a biggish thing?? If that's not against any kind of rules

But sometimes I have fun dissecting item code and whatnot, shame I'm so awful at it all lol
as trying ```paint:ClearEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_NO_SPRITE_UPDATE);``` just errors saying it's recieving a boolean
How would I clear an entityflag, without knowing it's integer value?
Hmm
but the discord is partly here to ask for help.
Yeah, not much of a bother, but it's all stuff that you can discover with a little bit of experimentati0n
it's not a bother haha
Okay, dope. Sorry to be a bother, friends
*sigh*
Yeah, any color really
```Lua
elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_LASER and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 and entities[i].Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then
        if rainbow == 1 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
      elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 and entities[i].Variant == EffectVariant.LASER_IMPACT then
        if rainbow == 1 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
```
In the case of a portal, since it's pretty much a perfect muted grey, you could get almost every color you wanted yeah?
Not 100% sure, but I've tested it before
Here:
I think it might be the child of the brim
Yeah, AFAIK you just have to find the impact entity
as i did
But full on fucking red
though you can also change the impact
And not "slightly red"
One for the brim, one for the impact
And two, it's two sprites
so it'll always be slightly red
So you can change that to be 1,1,1 in your custom anm2
1. Brimstone's sprite has 1,0,0 for RGB in the anm2
Because of two reasons
Oh sweet, thanks. I'm working on a talisman that, ideally, would summon a golden portal, sucking up lesser enemies and spitting back out coins
However, I'd recommend replacing the brimstone sprite
As in, edit a property during runtime
```Lua
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and (entities[i].FrameCount == 0 or entities[i].FrameCount == 1) and entities[i].Parent ~= nil and entities[i].Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then
          entities[i]:GetSprite().Color = Color(1,0,0,1,255,0,0); 
```
You can color sprites for sure
there is
Is there a way to code an alternate color onto a projectile, or would one need to recolor a projectile sprite to get, say, a golden Brimstone beam or neon green technology lasers?
Uhh
You should also check for the `EntityFlag.FLAG_NO_SPRITE_UPDATE`
You have to play the animation once, at the start of when you want it to animate
Of course not
no
what
..i think??
oh, you have to Play() the animation on every tick too
i can't seem to get my added animation working ;v;
but it doesnt animate
the sprite that appears is now my sprite
I edited the existing animations
<@219159380094877696>, did you edit the sprite file or add an animation?
trying to get some creep to animate how I want it to
What are you guys up to?
Good for you
not all of us are super pedantic and flip out if someone says something wrong
Yes, and as long as you don't flag them crappily, they autoupdate
entities have sprites yknow
Yes, he's calling it on `sprite`, but if you're working with entities here, what the fuck does that have to do with anything?
Specifically, `EntityFlag.FLAG_NO_SPRITE_UPDATE`
he's calling it on a sprite not an entity
Instead, make sure you're actually playing an animation and check its flags
Also, you shouldn't call Update on an entity
Because that'd be interesting
well uh um
Does the `function name` declaration predeclare the function?
creep is an entity
Also, <@84328068096733184>, that wouldn't work, would it?
Is the creep a sprite or an effect now?
Wait hold on what
AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, upd)

local function upd()
sprite:Update()
end
I'm spawning this entity effect inside like 4 if statements
that'll be a problem xD
yes
on every tick, right?
you gotta Update() i think
but it still doesn't animate, even if I call Play()
cathery, you were right - it changed the look of the creep (i did it to black now)
probably just typed it wrong then, dw
And `PLAYER_CREEP_LEMON_MISHAP`
There's `PLAYER_CREEP_LEMON_PARTY`
There's an `EffectVariant.CREEP_YELLOW`
<@219159380094877696> the one you get from being at half heart?
oh well
maybe yellow just happens to be the damn one that never had a reference
The autocomplete has **nothing** to do with the API
i can't find yellow creep too
It's your goddamn editor fucking up
It's not "the API"
Now, first of all
Okay
***WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN THINKING***
But
I'm sorry
now it doesn't
before if I typed PLAYER_CREEP_Y it would autocomplete
no, the command is literally no longer there
Does it error if you try to?
I'm seriously confused by what chain of reasoning lead you here
No, I mean I can't even spawn it's entity effect.
*"So it's weird, because the creep physically vanished from the API"*
*"Now it's invisible"*
?
*"I edited the yellow creep animation"*
*Are you serious*
the player yellow creep one
What anm2 file did you change?
Erm
There appears to be no difference in docs after the update, hm
and now I can no longer spawn yellow creep
I changed the .anm2 file and put it in my mod
...whut
from the api
the creep type physically vanished
And this time I have a backup of docs :o
hold on what
Isaac update?
:o
hold on, i'm trying to work alongside
but no luck ?
.anm2 file is done, names are the same and its in the same path as it was in the game
Hi
nah
so I don't have to edit an xml anywhere or...?
got it
lol
just have to actually find the creep animation file
it's a new generation of mods if this works
if this works i'll love you forever
i copied the extracted anm2 file, put it into modfolder\resources\gfx\ and edited it there
or in your own mod folder
Did you edit the .anm2 file in the actual game's files
i did that trick for the black cannon, where the item is pulsing while in your hands
and the game (probably) (possibly) would not overwrite that
pro trick: you can add ANOTHER animation inside that anm2 file, and call that on the creep
surely it'd take the animation from the game's base files
would that... work? ?
oh, you're trying to replace the creep's animation in-game? i think the game is constantly overwriting that
you might want to edit the existing anm2 file for the creep, such as `1000.022_creep (red).anm2` and put it in modfolder\resources\gfx\
but since the creep has its own animation, it overwrites my animation after 1 frame
if I do the same code onto a tear, it overwrites it and animates properly
the reason it's a problem is because the creep has its own 'glowing' animation
either one works
do you want a sprite on top of the creep, or instead of the creep?
if your sprite is animated, you need to sproot:Update() on every tick
tried that - it just overwrites the sprite instantly
```lua
local yourPosition = yourCreep.Position
local sproot = Sprite()
sproot:Load("your/anm2path.anm2", true)
sproot:Play("yourAnimationName", true)
sproot:Render(Isaac.WorldToRenderPosition(yourPosition, true), Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
```
Need to figure out how to render an animation on top of EntityEffect.PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN
Anyone adept at sprite/animation rendering in game?
Hmmmm I'm still getting the forehead below the player when I pick up an item
how are you doin guys
hey
and it's been dead for the past hour
<#264851654627688450> is dead
isaacfags reeee
GET OUT
THIS IS <#205854782542315520>
ALSO
it didn't work
well, technically it didn't reroll into itself
that's never happened before
an item that rerolled back into itself??
oh man
the chances of getting devil deals at dark room is low
it's the dark room
why reroll goat head
boi
`FUCKING GOAT HEAD`
`Takes bottom right red chest`
`Rerolls into poop bombs`
`Sees goat head in top right red chest in dark room`
its funny because the eye is weird-looking
GOOD
I must make stoned horfs
now
alright
goodbye nicalis
oh
god has abandoned us
<@147076393937797121> if you can, show my amazing graphics mod to leather & sag
not helping
"how about i shuffle every function of every hole in your face"
reminds me of this
this explains my mod perfectly
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846841086
HELP
How do I set an icon for my amazing mod
I don't think so
wow! you made jacksfilms!? ?
does your character have a very tall forehead then?
i posted something in <#264851654627688450>
hmmm, it's all aligned with other sprite sheets
I'll have a look
maybe I did that
it's also possible, though i can't tell from the screenshot, that you shifted the graphics instead of leaving them in place when you edited them
it really depends on the anm2 file. if you didn't change that then it shouldn't, i think
would that affect that animation tho? making the forehead invisible on that one?
you could remove the visible pixels under that frame in the sprite imgae file
how do I fix it? ?
you must have edited the sprite file in such a way that the crop rectangles used in the anm2 has visible image data in them
ahh

I'll post a screen shot
do you mean to say the item always appears over your characters costume? i'm not sure i understand otherwise
although i think if you hit 2 tears at once with that and they both can kill it, it will trigger for each one
why is that whenever I pick up an item my new character's forehead appears underneath?
for what it's worth though, i use the HP - DamageTaken method myself
aight, thanks
from my experience entity:HasMortalDamage() and not entity:IsDead() = true
to see if it would die
but, you could also just check if HP - DamageTaken <= 0
i don't know if it does or not, since its use is undocumented
speaking of actually working, does anyone know if entity:HasMortalDamage works? i'm trying to use it to spawn things when enemies die (through take damage event)

Alright, good to know.
~~assuming it actually works~~
not that hard even
I've heard that modifying those chances doesn't work properly at the moment, but it is theoretically possible
Also, hi I'm new here. :3
Hopefully quick question, is it possible to modify angel/devil room chance directly on a character?  Or, would I have to make an item and add it to that character?
you can't know what you're getting so it's innadvisable
rerolling magic mush is a bad strat
MM>HM
because i got holy mantle from it
<#264851654627688450>, and yes
is it bad that i rerolled magic mush?
How do I import custom textures?
there are only a few boss mods for ab+
Bayblade
okok just
if telling you the function that does the effect isn't enough then there's nothing more i can do
well i've done what i can
it's just i have literally no idea where to place it and what else needs to be there in it, chalenged
Anyone want these to make something out of?
did my suggestion not work from before?
oh rip
might be both
either a) nobody wants me to add pixelation or 2) nobody knows how to
so uhm
Yes, it's on HuttsGaming's subreddit since I wanna see if he picks it up.
Here is a reddit post of a challenge idea I came up with since I was bored: https://www.reddit.com/r/HuttsGaming/comments/5p90jt/afterbirth_take_it_all/
ah but then I can't quip in on everything
you can dm me yeah
ab+ meme item
What's the Eye of Belial?
<@!135254843567767552> would you prefer i private message you or just post things here?
that's isaac for you
well so is 20/20
but thevisual effect looks nice
it's free double amage
the way it works is kinda OP
? OP SYNERGY ALERT ?
really?
lmao i have no control over eye of belial unfortunately, less than deadeye
props
eye of belial is so good with mei
I know there's the spawn command which allows the spawning of things such as Suit Cards
i'm probably wrong
waitwut
isn't there spawnconsumable?
From debug console
What variable would I use to spawn Credit Cards?
i figured this would be simple, i just don't know where to start
oh okay
its just a simple recolored halo from ingame
mhm
do you have the spritework done paige?
I imagine that's how most people who have taken the time to experiment and learn about it feel
but yeah, loli, any resources you can show me (yourself included, if that's okay) would be great! :)
i could document almost all of this stupid shit but i'd rather work on mods than do that
guess enthusiasm is just really that low
honestly I'm surprised there hasn't been more of a community effort to solve this wacky arg
lol i was about to say
RemindMe! 4 years
then I'll deal with ab+
someone ping me when all the functionality is properly documented
if you don't mind? i'm trying my best to not step on toes and be the "ideas" guy or whatever, i wanna learn and make it myself, i'm just very lost
if you're just looking to try and learn i can at least point you to the right stuff
if you want some help that seems like a very short, simple mod
well as long as you can work with it
you have to set it after the entitylaser exists, not a big deal
that's where I'd start then
they have a brimstone distance limit yeah, but not as an argument
they do
mhm
I wouldn't be surprised if nicalis doesn't even have a range argument for their brimstone spawning
ah yeah you mentioned that idea the other day
despite looking at the documentation i don't know how to mimick analog stick, nor how to move a brimstone beam's firing position from the "mouth" to above the head
so far i've got the item ingame with no effects(although it doesn't spawn on a pedestool, i can spawn it from console though)
but i don't even know where to get started
should be
sounds like something which should be simple to make
basicially just a weird, kinda different holy themed brimstone
since, y'know, shooting from a halo
aka full 360 degree shooting
its a silver halo that's above a characers head, makes them unable to shoot normal tears but isntead they shoot the angel's yellow beam(short range like azazels brimstone) from the actual halo itself, and it's got the effects of analog stick
that's nicalis for you
nah, i detailed it the other day, and im still trying to learn what exactly i need to do to make it but i can't even get a costume right on a character so its looking bleak :p
does it turn pits into familiars?
what item are you trying to make?
now if only i could figure out how to apply this knowledge to the item im trying to make
(it looks bad so i dropped it for now)
not efficient but it was just testing code
```lua
entity.Child:GetSprite():ReplaceSpritesheet(0,"gfx/lasers_mei.png")
entity.Child:GetSprite():LoadGraphics()
```
good to know
specific to an item/character
so you can make a custom laser gfx
wow!
https://files.catbox.moe/kj21yg.mp4 i was messing around with it yes, looks like it works fine
bloodshot eye
60.1
sec i got it
oh uh
or the brim and zappy eyes in the womb?
what's the name of that one eyed sheol laser zapper floater guy
oh that's what it does
thats how my run was going, anyway
for each enemy marked with grudge, she gains 0.19 damage
i assume because of grudge
and why is there 0.19 fluxuating damage
let's see
loli, i'm not sure if you saw earlier, but out of curiousity, did you find a way to reskin lasers(technology, brimstone, etc) for mei exclusively?
ah
i have an idea of how to fix continuum, i just haven't put it into place
because i set the velocity every frame to move it back into position, continuum offsets its position, the tear will fight to get back into position
continuum is really buggy
debugging with people that have 20 other mods installed is gonna be hell
well you can do Game:AddPixelation() i think but it doesn't work for me since I don't know where to add it and it just fucks up the other items
but people have reported dying with dead cat removes her hair and it doesn't for me, though i've only tested it with a few costumes
hm, interesting
yeah null costumes seem to be removed when rerolling and respawning at times
after respawning
i picked up guppys collar from devil deal and died to get it, now im like this :p
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9345075/ShareX/2017/01/2017-01-20_22-48-12.png
oh uh, looks like i broke mei
though i haven't personally used it
there sure is a peculiarly named function that seems like it would pixelate the screen for an arbitrary length of time
don't believe so
as for your dataminer effect, someone answered a bit early i think, also have you seen the documentation?
no one should ever tell you how to do that and no one should ever do it
no
is nobody going to tell me how to add retro vision to an item permenantly
i think i kinda started it by bringing it up as a "bug" and at this point im just theorycrafting for fun
i think her tear spawning looks fine right now, but if other people think it looks janky then i dunno
i'm not even sure what problem you guys are trying to solve right now to be honest haha
lol
ouch, that would be a good solution if there was
they respawn on her firedelay timer and there is no "behind" her since you can flip shooting directions exceptionally quickly
can't you just respawn them when they go behind you?
it would still be the same orbit though right?
*cough cough*
So the perfect scenario is that they're always orbiting and they can hit multiple enemies, correct?
I could also very easily make them ease into their position based on how many tears are active, but that would mean they're constantly shifting out of their position making aiming them even more difficult
ah, well that stinks
i can definitely make them spawn directly in the right position, but having them appear in the right position looks worse than having them appear from mei
if that's true then idk why it would seem janky
oh by the way, loli, i noticed in mei's files theres a "lasers_mei.png", i assume that means you recolored the way lasers look coming from mei?
all I ever saw was the steam page, but I imagine there's some sort of algorithm to determine the position in the rounded path divided by the number of tears and offset by time and then when a new one is spawned the old ones interpolate into the next positioning while the new one interpolates from mei's position to its reserved one
but ludovico and spectral tears also handled blowing up TNT under the tear automatically even if doesn't  have the flag to collide with them
but it rips synergies?
the ludovico flag handles resetting that timer automatically
oh
once a penetration flagged tear hits an enemy it can not hit that enemy again
without respawning the tear
hey so i still need help adding a dataminer effect to an item that doesn't activate all the time but has a large chance
because, if i understand loli right, after hitting anything with your starting 3 shots, you're unable to damage anything past that
wait so why doesn't spectral+piercing work?
is that even possible? i dunno
which is what they currently do
and then drift back out to the line
as opposed to ontop of/inside of mei
rebirth is now 100 kb
why not have them always spawn in a specific place in "line"?
sure, i have to position them after all
who's got the deets
rebirth just patched
is it possible to track the position of the orbital?
i could remove the explosive flag on tears until they're a certain distance away yeah, and I do that with ipecac currently, but in the end i think i prefer the tears to be there all the time. i'd just like to be able to control the "i can hit this entity again" thing
could you not just remove the explosive flags from those tears and add in some explosive themed exception?
hmm
even though i liked how it felt, i couldn't keep it
i also tried to let her tears fall to the ground as usual, but then explosive synergies are suicide
sucks it ends up being kinda janky but interesting nontheless
that's pretty interesting
also, if i respawned them in that position instantly, it would be exceptionally fast respawning meaning i'd have to put a delay on damage onto every tear entity, etc etc. it's a workable solution i did try out, but dropped
lucky!
so if you don't find a way to respawn the tears without marking them ludo, spectral, or pen, you lose the ability to damage anything after like 3 shots?
thats something
nvm, seems like I just randomly got Curse of the labyrinth 5 floor sets in a row
ohhh i see
any*
i tried that for a while and respawning them would constantly cause and on fire effects to happen
you could respawn them at that position
but with ludovico, spectral and penetration synergies are moot, so i wanted to remove those flags
the only reason she even had spectral piercing to begin with is because you can't, to my knowledge, force an enemy to be hit by the same tear twice unless the tear is marked with the ludovico tear flag, so since her tears never fall to the ground to be replaced, they would only hit an enemy as many times as she had orbitals leading to most enemies after basement to be unkillable if they weren't ludovico tears
Only mod I have that affects curses is curse of greed
hey uh, I'm not sure why but I'm getting curse of the labyrinth on every single floor
out of curiousity
why'd you remove the spectral/piercing effect?
i tried to make it as not jank as possible by keeping the other tears in orbit unhindered, but in the end it's still pretty not great looking
np
still useful though, so thanks
sorry for the false bug report :P
yeah that's pretty much what i was expierincing. good to know its intended
now when a new tear spawns it just eases into its target position after spawning on top of her
i figured it was some simple explanation like that.
ah that makes sense, okay then
the first time you played her the tears never disappeared because they were penetration
the tear that hits an enemy "dies" and a new one is put into the rotation really jankily. i dunno if thats intended or even preventable but i don't remmeber it happening the first time i played her
oh okay: easier way to describe it
i assume you're the creator?
i can see if i can try to recreate it
the tear that fired was like infront of her, so when it came back to the rotation it wasn't smooth at all and looked funky
instead it was kind of janky
which is how it was the first day she was on the workshop
the tear "coming up" in rotation firing out
when i was firing to the left, as opposed to like..
what happened?
maybe just a side-effect of her unique tears
i had a slightly weird issue with mei earlier, but im not so sure its an "issue"
no one who has had a problem running mei has given me any useful information on why so i haven't been able to figure out why she doesn't work here and there
if its not too much to ask, could i privately talk to someone far better at this stuff than i am? i'm really lost and I don't wanna spam this chat or anything.
ernie after bert sounds depressing as hell
Hahahaha nice
the binding of ernie: afterbert+
also
Oh well that's fine
e
turning player's bombs into troll bombs meaning that they explode with a random fus
Turning all troll bombs into super troll bombs sounds like a good curse though
I'd rather refrain from touching the player's bombs haha
i already have a custom player in with different stats and all that, im trying to get him to spawn with the angel wings from the seraphim transformation. i have the anm2 file with the wings but i can't seem to make it work
of course, that would dick over someone with Dr. Fetus
oh, this custom player example isn't what i was looking for :P
how hard would it be to code a curse which turns all bombs, yours and troll bombs, into those homing troll bombs?
i still need custom heart collisions
Oh okay
Just downlaoded
and I didn't write any
so I think mei is the only issue
currently it's only the graphics
If you wrote XML files, make sure you closed all your tags, didn't forget to close your quotes etc
also no insta crash on entering item room
2many
<@203215784770535424> How?
That's the cause of crashes 90% of the time
n-nothing's wrong...
Check your XML
file conflicts or game overload?
interesting
Cause what would happen with me is that if I had a character mod and item mods enabled (eg. Soleil and Ascalon Spear), I had a 50/50 chance of the game crashing.
Was able to start a run as issac fine
it crashed instantly when I tried the first time
Or sometimes?
Does it happen all of the time?
too powerful
but she's crashign the game when I try to play her lol
I installed mei
rip
Maybe try and find a way to have soul/black hearts in a different area?
baka!
Is the hard part
That...
but what about soul hearts
It would help with saving space, but I gotcha
i could
Ok.
eg. Red = 1 layer, orange = 2 layer, yellow = 3 layer and so on?
not really
<@!194259969359478784> Do you plan on doing it so that, as you get more and more hearts, each layer of hearts becomes another color
For lua
no lua
it's very simple

but then its not working :[
and i thought i had it
mei, wolves, etc
i looked at a few characters
2many
which one
oh?
there's an example on the workshop
im scratching my head at this real hard
So.. How exactly does one get a new character to spawn with a costume?
it wasn't to many for vanilla
well than an extra row or whatever
but that's too many
Silly
To have infinite hearts heh
why not
why on earth would you do that
an item that allows infinite hearts to be picked uup
what are you planning?
bob
das a lot of hearts
:)
sneak peek :)
I'll see what I can do
Alright, good night
When you get to a computer could you somehow send me the code that made it work?
Good night
Anyway, I'm going to bed
*dang
Sang
Can't really help more than that right now, sorry
Well, I don't know. I know that I did stuff differently and it worked
theyre all under its sprite
but entity doesnt have any animation style methods
Entities, without affecting the game
Effects should just be the same as entitiel
It's probably just me being unable to understand how the POST_RENDER callback works :/
But I'm sure there's something
I can't check because I'm on the phone.
nope
It should be for the entity class
it's only a vector()
Also, isn't there a function like entity:animate()?
There isn't a depth offset
Sounds about right
You have found **5** item(s).
!items
Yay i got dirty mind...
I can try
the sprite is tied to it, no?
What about the depth offset?
```Lua
          local paint = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player):ToEffect();
          paint:GetSprite():Load("gfx/effects/acid.anm2", true); paint:GetSprite():Play("Bubble", true);
          paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 255, 0);
          paint.CollisionDamage = player.Damage * 2;
          paint.Scale = 2;
          paint:SetTimeout(100);
```
until it becomes transparent and vanishes
but it renders for a split second, doesn't animate, and then stays 'behind' the creep
I want to render bubbling acid on top of the effectvariant PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN
The problem is something to do with entity effects
pm me the sprite sheet
anyone good at that?
I'm having trouble with sprites and animations being rendered in-game
the "mad science" with nothing special is fine as is
dont put anything
any idea for the left side, or do you not think it needs something there
Nice, thanks
<@219159380094877696>
Use the box and cross thing the other characters use
yeah, i had it at that before but the sides felt empty
some kinda meme like this
alright
the second one looks especially weird, since you cant really shade like that with a pencil
Yeah, it's weird because no other characters do that
and just leave "mad science" as it is
i would recommend no potions
Levelled-liquid potions or classic potions
Quick thing: Which is better?

how to detect if tear fired is fired in front? (example: im not need detect tear fired by mom´s eye from back)
ok so how do i add dataminer effect
Makes sense
?
i only started this mod this morning.
sadly, there's no synergy with tech/brimstone yet etc
it doesn't
if you get lucky it freezes enemies for ages
How does it work with Tech(nology | 2 | X), Kidney Stone, Brimstone ?
i don't see a red, only orange ?
yellow is if you ahve alot of luck
blue is for close enemies
red is for utility and groups
the green is good for bosses and long range
lol
so the meta is to use the blue potion only
That's so awesoooome
blue potion explodes into tears, has tear effects and scales with damage
yellow potion gives status effects, scales with luck and damage
Red potion explodes with bomb effects, scales on player damage and bomb items
Green potion leaves behind acid that scales with player damage
https://streamable.com/2qcri
here's the full video:
Also you didn't spawn an explosion for the green ones, is that intentional ?
2 hearts
*2
it's 21
cuz we dont know its hp
also curse of the unknown doesnt help
and thasnks flipskiz
*tear
with all team effects and bomb effects
<@219159380094877696>  Use streamable instead of gfycat
there's already synergy
Good thinking
If you pick up an active item it removes it and spawns chests/keys/bombs
Niiice
a character that starts with ipecac
I did
woah
or sunday
i'll release it either tomorrow night
You should make it so you can't get rid of it
That's awesome
That looks like Ipecac + Fruit Cake haha
lol
damn, the gif cuts off before the last 2 potion effects
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
I didn't suggest it, was someone else. I just know that retro effect is bad

But I'm probably gonna regret it later
18 in a month here, I dunno how fine that is for me ._.
I can pull off mad productivity at no cost
Although, I say that, no better myself
I'm only 19 right now so it's sups fine
But that's the kind of shit that gets you later when you're a full-blown aging adult
You want to live in the future, right?
But if you sleep more, you live longer. So it would be like time travel!
I'm actually immune to fatigue
Not immediately no
Oh my god has it had a deteoriating effect on you because I'm on my second yeah here ;-;
I'm gonna die at 45 at this rate but heh at least I've got 20 hours days so I've got that going for me, which is nice
I've been sleeping 2 to 6 hours a day for 5 years
You gotta get those sweet synnergies in there ya know
it's working but
It's like
Yeah ?
Man Im getting 6 hours of sleep all of the time I gotta fix up my sleep schedule
Well, later today really haha
Just call it day and polish it tomorrow
3 am here haha
It's 4 am here almost Im pretty sure this is the end for the coding now ha ?
Which can be bad when two milestones are really close haha
Usually when I do, I just stop there for the day
I'm a game dev, that happens every time I reach a milestone
just, have it, have it already
Ooooh yeah I do haha
wanna give it to the world
you just
Man you know that feel when you've completed something nad you know there's still stuff to balance out in the code but
Now it's your turn to take that into account
Yeah I try
finally
constructive criticism
And also don't insult people trying to help you, because that's how you turn those people into people that don't want to help you
Instead of shouting instantly "I know" and slowing the whole process more than if you said nothing
If the beginning of the explanation is unnecessary, just let it happen and wait for the interesting part
And let people help you
Just don't get fired up all of the sudden
<#205854501083545601>
Chill out, if you want to find help about this issue
lets not spam <#205854782542315520> anymore
Well alright maybe I'm going a bit far, sorry about that last remark
well
*a biiiiit*
You're expressing them a bit too much
Dude this is not #therapy
if this chat does the same, im out
I got kicked/banned from another chat, more specifically, SMBX, for expressing my feelings
No problem, you were of great help
thank you for making me feel like a little <:poo:230363864724799488>
-> <#205854501083545601>
And also, wrong channel
So be careful and actually use the tab next time
Nothing is cross-compatible, 0%
Anyway. Your shit won't work if it's for the wrong DLC
In case you wondered
You're the cunt in this case Runic tbh
It's just so funny
^
Holy fuck this is like Middle School ending all over again
either you let be helped or you go away
Well look at you go haha
I don't give a shit
be more mature than me
Be the bigger person
Oh you bet
Yes, go avenge your father's death or something
be toxic back to me
so be it
Let him be, he needs no help
Don't mind him FlipskiZ
Tell me, why do you come in to the modding chat, which isn't even for helping people use mods, but actually modding the game, and be toxic to people that try to help?
Have fun working that out by yourself
hmph
No use deleting that shit
Too late pal
"suck on that" yeah right
it has just been added
AND
so I wont have to download the wrong version of a mod
Guess who's not been using that correctly haha
Yeah, so ?
to search for Afterbirth+ mods
now moddingofisaac has a DLC tab
well, hey
And they won't work unless you disable AB+ for the first one, and both AB+ and AB for the other one
Only natural that those don't work.
And that's even worse since that's Rebirth
As I expected
Okay so for starters, that's an AB mod, not AB+
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/33/infinite-item-charge
Yeah no that I agree
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1316/extremely-overpowered-start-afterbirth
but I wont download a mod that replaces portals with a bat girl
Or I can't help
Anyway, links plz
I like Mei
I said MOST of them
Or that new custom boss, The Peeping
I guess you don't like that new character with her unique gimmick, Mei
And yeah that's short-sighted and lazy to say
You can at least expect new mods to work
Dude, send me the links to where you downloaded those mods you're trying to use
they're spam
Well, that's short-sighted
I hate the newer mods
most of them
Why not ?
no can do
like Bathany the Bat?
Can you link the mods you DLed ?
Try other mods
Then the problem is with the mod itself
Oh well that's something else
thats the thing
but they dont work in game
I enable them
it does
Doesn't show up in the Mods tab ?
still doesnt work
If you have to manually separate the things in it, you're doing it wrong
You don't have to check the files inside, just extract the ZIP in there
I have to get the STB and XML folders and put them in there
To be sure, check that the main.lua file and all the other files/folders pop up right when you enter the directory from `Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods`
soooooo
...
Are you sure that you didn't add an extra layer of folders ?
As their own folders ?
and put both in there
but I extracted it
ill try "Bathany Replaces The Portals"
You can't keep it a ZIP
well, if those mods dont work
yup
Yep
extract it in there?
Damn son
noice
https://gyazo.com/fd688fc36dc8cf6e41f7c4338c90c546
I'm assuming that you know of the `Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods` folder, and that you tried to extract the ZIP file of the mod into there ?
also, if you're on ab+, why not just use the workshop?
Isaac had an update today, not major but still
ill try a dumb, stupid new mod
If the faq didn't help, nor did the readme, nor anything maybe it's version differences?
Anyway
Also that
its not like you knew I knew that
There is no way to tell you immidiately what to do ?
well
I'm trying to help
Dude chill out
I KNOW THERE IS A MY GAMES FOLDER
Also that
with one of them, yes
Assuming you're on Windows, you have a My Games folder in Documents
Are you sure they even are compatible with ab+?
I am doing overpowered start and infinite item charges
I read it
yes
Anything in a readme in the mod?
https://moddingofisaac.com/help/
I did
I did everything
oh just put them into the afterbirth+ mods folder
moddingofisaac.com
just look at that
There is a faq on the site
where are htey from?
<@230338331290894336>  If you want to add it via Steam Workshop just install it
no one replied
but when I said my mods are from moddingofisaac
they did
also someone answered didn't they runic?
I wont bother with mods
not a bad idea actually
shit, no one cares about helping me, soooooooooooo
oh
<@227262590697340928>  how about random datamine effect lol
Retro Vision pill already breaks that rule which is a mistake IMO, game design-wise
[insert long ass sigh here]
what is the formule for "the sad onion" for tears up?
Yup, pretty much
In general, items should target the character, not the player
And less annoying
<@227262590697340928> you should find a better, more interesting way to crank up the challenge
Infinite Item Recharges and Overpowered Start
and they're from Modding of Isaac
<@230338331290894336> Subscribe to them and enable, nothing more than that
and less annoying
they're way more interesting
you could implement one of Kube's shaders
how can I install mods?
I mean, to make them work, I did everything
even enabled them
and its Afterbirth+
Dont do Retro vision
terrible retro vision but 13.50 dmg
lewd
I wouldn't bet it goes for most people though
I mean, some people like being tied in chains and getting whipped
it's why it's such a large dmg up tho
hey
Noone likes retro vision
Just ... don't
I'm sure some people like retro vision.
Retro vision is stupid by itself
but you do you meng
people take issue with the retro vision
how about just retro vision and dmg?
I fucking finally have a raw, finished item
but
I hate how I made the sides of the sprite
Don't do that item, it's stupid and annoying as I said
you did it
https://streamable.com/osmxf
But annoying hard is not good design, imo
it's the worst item in the game
Heck you start with 1 x)
I would rather make the game harder in some way
exactly
-1 speed is absurd too
But no, I hate annoying stuff
cool
:
it gives you retro vision, -1 speed, and +10 dmg
It's a :
i've never referenced game
wait is that a : or a .
Game():AddPixelation(duration)
That's just stupid and annoying
Don't do that though
i will make the world hate me
If I had that happen to me I would cause a nationwide riot
yes
...Are you sure that you want that?
yes but where do i add it in and how do i add it in correctly
or was it someone else
didn't i tell you before
hello does anyone know how to add permanent retro vision effect without it fucking up the rest of the mod
Right
that's only online
Why you lie like this Robo-Baby
> more angels than demons
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I want to be an angel
than ever before
more like gays
Cobalt streak is playing mods!
Which triggers when an entity takes damage
Closest thing to that is MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE
collisions are not a fun time
So no, no collision callback
You have to do your own collisions
is there a collision callback
Get swifty is an active item, so you get swifty when you use it
*shit
perfect
You get schwifty and a shit spawns all around
A lot of material to use
and so on
Plumbus item
Morty with an active item to summon Rick
I'm gonna make Morty
that is an excellent idea
Come to think about it, a Rick and Morty themed mod would be awesome
oh and not fuck up all the other items in the mod
so does anyone know how to add retro vision into a script and to make it actually work yet
it kind of helps to understand what's going on there
in your text document
but really do look at one
thanks a lot ?
I don't know why I don't use more of the official files as references -.-
dunno look at one of the unpacked ones as an example
naming rule
Possibly, do they have a certain rule they must follow?
yup
it could be the names of your layers
I guess I haven't properly done something with these layers
so your anm2 has something wrong with it
It works with another anm2 hmm
file
It's definetly in the anms2
and compare it to your custom one
since they're basically just fancy xml
is open up one of the unpacked anm2s in your text editor
another thing you can do
Good idea, I'll try that
like, give your item a pre-existing costume and see if it works
what happens if you set your item to use one of the game's default costumes?
they*
I'm pretty sure htey are, I checked
either?
As in HeadUp, HeadDown etc? Or refferenced in the main properly
are your costume's animations named properly?
dunno
could that be causing it?
every update but I canfix that
Anyways there was an issue where I updated the costume on
again and again ?
- Adding costume for 41 () which was added before and never removed.
[INFO] - [warn] Costume for item 41 () has no layers!
[INFO]
oh I see from your previous screenshot
what exactly is the log saying hex?
<@116386733905412105> no; it will return to the player fast; idk
I *do* have a layer on that anm2
what does that mean
If my log says my costume has no layers
I asked in spriting but I'lkl ask here too
also does the Friction attribute have anything to do with it?
and then are there any adverse effects of setting the parent to the bomb then back to the player?
does follow parent let you control the speed?
parent
and i need the familiar to move himself to bombs as well as isaac
is parent the position of the player or the position of the parent
position can be anything
takes no args
parent is the position of the player
what's the difference between FollowParent and FollowPosition
might just be me
<@172780123504771074> trippy af
on ui
BREAKTHROUGH
OMFG
i can control it but i seems that followpositon overrides the familiars velocity
lol
?
https://gyazo.com/d71fa03c53e8b6ffed82b7d961e829de
When you checking that log and shit gets artsy
don't you control his speed
uh
ex: go to a bomb then come back to isaac
hey guys im still on this familiar , i managed to do what i wanted but is there any way to slow him down when he has to follow a position
plx ty
screw off robo baby
oh , let me fix it.
"right now", you say
Im guessing not, the api has been shyt since ab+ was released...
Besides editing the layout inside the room.
has anyone made any custom stuff involving rooms yet?
so uh
?
late*
See ya Kube
:' )
gutnite
It's obviously never too alte for ok_woman
cy'all
It's late here
I should probably go now
She's summoning the great sleeping one, Cthudat
"Praise the sun god"
"ok_woman"
?
?
What the fuck is this emote
Also, can I just say
:' )
it's a good guess, sure
Dog is
uh
*something*
is it a dog
That was
Let's just say that Zatherz put in too much work to fix it
It's pinned on one server
I could post a particular piece of *emoji art* a... *friend* decided to port to discord
nice roleplay
I...
plsdontbanme
waaaaaaaay deep in there
well that was interesting
I guess they're into stuffing things up
Right, we got a bit caught up, I can't wait for s3
It's amazing we got this far with 6 mods online
Okay, I think this already went too far, let's just stop it before the mods stop ignoring this shitpost
B-But Kube w-what if they see us sneaking this missing A-Api through there, w-what should we do
but I had to steal it, they won't let me through the checkpoint
the very essence of isaac community
its the very es**burp**
without this, i won't understand what the community wants
this is important to me
listen to me, hexa
W-Wha K-K-K-Kube I-I can't n-No I cant!
you'll have to stuff it up waaaaaa**burp**aaaay deep in there
Y-You should put that back in-in a-a-a shit museum~
you'll have to
now, listen to me he-**burp**-hexa
Kube! That's an actual shit!
?
O-Okay Kube, b-but I don't like this!
here, ju-just hold this
Shit on the floor!
you wanna see some shit, hexa?
*burp*
you wanna
You wanna see some
This is some Rick & Morty shit
its a Im So Meta Even This Acronym :OOOOOOOOOOOO
Yeah right it's like someone tried to censor the word cock and just stuck with it sort of
It's a ticky tock thing that does
clock is a weird ass word
its a wib wob tim wim thi
what is a clock
xOOOO
or ull access old memories
and you have to remember to set your system clock setup properly
its the officiel term
It's a wibbly wobbly timey wimey typed language
If it's not a strictly type defined language idk what the english term was again *sigh*
Or a={a,a}
Also that ?
ueah
It can even be
Then "Hexanix is a whore"
The next moment it can be {1,2,3}
So a Variable a can be equal to 5, but then can be equal to 9 the next moment.
what is a constant variable
It's hard to define
Yes, the value can be changed
The exact definition varies from language to language
But it isn't constant
No but seriously a variable is basically a value associated with a certain variable name
hlw do delete internet from son?
Can you set your memory to readonly mode?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJRKedSUHg4
what is a man? a miserable little pile of secrets
How do you use memories as random access memory?
What are frogs?
what is a question
How long do you have to have RAM installed to classify it as memory?
what's a melon to a man
How long do you have to remember things to classify it as a memory
What is a memory?
What is memory?
That's a tough question
He's going in deep
what's a variable
Probably v.xrx too
Or v.xxx
But you can also do v.xzy
You can do, like, v.xyz to get a 3D vector from a 4D one
Also I love the way GLSL handles stuff
It's just a vec4, where v.x is the same as v.r
There's no `color` in GLSL
Get used to vec4s
For example, if you start doing shader modding in Isaac
I was thinking in Isaac terms, soz ><
You're rightm yeah
But a vector can have however many coordinates you want it to
Isaac's a 2D game, so of course it has 2 coordinates
Also, it doesn't necessarily have 2 coordinates
Yeah, uses
It's a set of numbers, representing a point
It's uses then?
The meaning is the same
But in programming, it's not only a direction, it's also a position, a normal, a weird place to store stuff, a color, whatever you can imagine
It has different meanings accross mediums yes
It's used as a direction in maths and physics and whatnot
Oh, a vector is so much more than a direction
what's a parameter
as parameters
you give it x and y
direction, I guess, that's how I always explained it to myself
It's a math thing, the easiest way to describe it is
what's a vector
I dont know if I should post this I might get shouted at ?
I went back with another question and saw only you and another guy were active and just went like
When I asked about Vectors I believe
Tbh when I first came around the server you scared me off of it for a day or so
I'm an asshole, man
Now don't you go around getting weird ideas
Interesting,  I didn't know that, TIL I guess ? Thanks Kube, you're a cool guy
Hmm..
RPN* yeah sorry typo
A custom embedded language for scripting in custom maps
I know Creeper World uses it for CRPL
Though rarely as a serious language, I'd imagine
And, well, sometimes
*RPN
Does RPM see use today?
And along with that, conditionals, loops, etc
Well, can't consider the source a stack if you want to have labels and goto
you're just pulling from two stacks in a way
I suppose not, it does seem pretty logical now that you think about it
But it wouldn't be surprising if it was, eh?
Yeah, that's why I said I doubt it
I definetly wouldnt think it's a predecessor if it was trying to improve on computer memory access
The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by Burks, Warren, and Wright[4] and was independently reinvented by F. L. Bauer and E. W. Dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and utilize the stack to evaluate expressions.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was a precursor to infix-based languages, though I doubt it
Very efficient
VERY easy to parse
Reasonable
It's just, well
Not really odd
wow that's an odd idea
since they've been the last thing onto the stack, right
and pushes 7 onto the stack
it adds them
It pushes 4, it pushes 3
So when it encounters the + in `3 4 +`, the stack is [3, 4]
And every time it finds an operator, it pops the appropriate number of elements from the stack and applies the oprator on them, pushing the result back on the stack
And the way a parser works is that every time it finds a literal, it pushes it on the stack
And `+` is an operator
`"asdf"` is a literal
`2` is a literal
You basically have literals and operators
But in coding it's a bit more funny
That's the idea of RPN in general
I mean
Not exactly
so the logic there is you first give it the parameters and then the function?
Wuh, I've been living in a lie my whole life, I've though RPN was just all-word. That's.. much weirder.
RPN is `3 4 + 2 *`
infix is `2*(3+4)`
The thing is
<@172780123504771074> I don't think you understood
what
erm
Anyone willing to try a run with my mod?
i think its ready for playtesting
OK
to my*
haha yes i do like litteraly explaining my PC how to compute things with words rather than mathematical equations ty
And that teachers don't teach RPN simply because they don't understand it
He says that infix is awful and RPN is the true and most intuitive way of writing down stuff
The creator of this "language" kept talking about how amazing his language is and how short it is
Like this monstrosity <https://github.com/johnmorrisbeck/concatenativeJavascript/>
Yeah, that's fair
*I've seen some shit*
After all, some people would think that seriously
I wasn't sure if I did
You know what I meant
Yeah, that sounded very broad
Ofc if you need only one line that's fine
If it would be beneficial of using more than one
I mean
What
<@124088844181045249> `Nobody in their right minds would use single line if lines if they didn't have to`
shit was awkward as hell
ended up pushing my notes over the desk with a keyboard cause it was in front of me
Although I tried to cheat once
I didn't pay any attention to the hardware-related classes, mostly caught up on sleep or tried proigramming
10th grade and that shit was hell in the Mathemathical School, we were really pushed to the edge cause it was the fullest curriculu,
no idea sadly
wehad that at like
I don't want to bother with it right now
I feel you. It's not hard it's just..
¯\_(?)_/¯
And it really was about network topologies, connecting up some random bullshit and so on
For AB+
Hey what would I use to replace music in issac?
Well, I don't even know myself. On a scale of 1-6 grades where 1 is fail I got 3 in electrical and computer stuff that was in reality easy.
ah, education
that shouldnt be a thing in programming classes lol
What happened? ?
which actually kinda happened to me anyway
lol
oh well lol
1. Death
poison/burn/slowing/fear/freeze/shrink
I would fail that class just by "doing it the wrong way", haha
What order do you rank the status effects in?
a free programme, just everyone looking at the stuff they wanna learn on their own
noone really studies that we're more uh..
I mean
We're at Visual Basic and some C++ now
But yes they did
I didn't listen to that class! Lennyface.jpg
Ha
I bet they teached you to use gotos too
these people sound special.
^^^^^^
Nobody in their right minds would use single line if lines if they didn't have to
She was a living fossil, I bet she was around to see the first Pravets PCs
wtf sort of teachers did you have? lol
Single. Line. Ifs.
was single line
She claimed the only correct way to do it
that did not allow us to use the if statement with curly brackets
We had a programming teacher
stuff of legends
Straight up show the class a circuit board from a TV and just started explaining about all the components and one guy just raised his hand and asked him "Hey, what's that component over there?" The teach went silent. Looked at the component. Stared for a good 20 seconds. Looked back at us and announced: "That, I have no idea what it is." and he didn't speak til the end of the class
IOT WORKS
I want the source of poison to be the player
I think that's how it worked
EntityRef(player)?
How do I get an entity ref for the player
y'know
so
Well, our technical teacher though wi-fi signals give you cancer
honestly we had this dude
Being in a class like mine it's hard to belive some of the IT teachers
My. God.
And I'm amazed that it's something special that you have an IT teacher that knows about IT
And I think he manages the system that lets each user have a separate networked drive with access from home
The computers would start up at 24:00 every day, format the hard drives and replace them with an image from the server
Before our PCs upgraded he had a system setup
And there's one teacher who at least knows what he's doing
One replaced a teacher that taught a class word for 3 years without teaching anything
One decided to install Ubuntu on shitty old macs
We have 3 IT teachers
TBH our school is like
It's not a big deal, but then we have the internship programm and for that I have to dabble into MVC aswell and..
and databases
it was really just sql
Only thing related to programming I found in my school was a sql book
Well we're in a shit then, but we do have that so
Shit
It's, just
I mean
I wish we had that, easy full grade
it's
I don't know how to call it honestly
"programming specialty class"
Sounds like a free grade for you, honestly
bare html?
Synergies are always awesome
We're in a prigramming specialty class and we have that, but holy crap
<@219159380094877696> Make special item interactions!
What's the point of IT in schools?
unless it includes javascript
lol, what's the point of learning html without css today?
Yeah, school program apparently "Doesn't allow it since it;s not in the school program urr durr"
lol
and surprise surprise brimstone just gives you brimstone.
every other potion is deep red
lol blood clot makes it very weird
You were about to make web sites without css?
Web Design is in the way cause it's time to make html sites.
We JUST BARELY convinced our teach to at leasy allow us to use css aswell
i only started modding last sundsay
and
damn lucky you I jus tstarted getting the gist of it
;-;
I started this yesterday and was at work all day
hahaha
Fuck man how do you mod it so fast
well then that's nice ?
oh
just replace the bombs with that to make bomb hoarding actually feel good
it'll take 25 of them to kill duke of flies
the bombs actually do barely any more damage than a normal tear
once i got to the boss i found out
...oh
Having it use your bombs would make it worthless though
Could some one PM me the link to the Mod Tool Download?
make it take out of your bombs if he can even collect those
so nice to be able to throw over rocks
make it do half damage or something
cos it god damn explodes
I found out there's no point using anything other than red potion
after some testing
We would do what edmund did for Pokeymon
Copyrights and whatnot
Yeah, except for, y'know
We'd try to get Edmund to add it
Harry Potter,Yu-Gi-Oh,Beyblade and Digimon themed mod would be cool
I always thought the Philosopher Stone would've been cool
https://gyazo.com/c87d75975648697d7dad9e12cd5de994
he will wear a plague doctor mask eventually
it's a sort of alchemist/mad scientist character
any extra ideas?
Kek cool
XD
with pitch of 4.7
ultra greed's sound for coins being destroyed
How did you get that?
that was the tough part xD
they also make glass smashing noises when thrown
lol
tfw can't emote
ah
yellow gives status effects
Orange/red explodes
what's the difference between yellow and orange?
Looks awesome!
ohh!! it's so cool

This is my new character so far:
I might spawn a ton of pickups when it happens
and yeah, not really
OK
At least yet
Since I believe we can't check if an item is an active item or not
that would mean making a fairly long list though
You could also try to automatically reroll items that are not in the set
Maybe
would you be mad
and it auto-changes the item back to the item in the set
And you pick up an active item that isn't in the set
If a character needs a set of active items to work
Question for all of you
Millennium Items could be a thing
I got the D4
oshet
___LET IT RIP___
Maybe a Beyblade could be a active with a one room charge that bounces off of enemies when it collides with them
~~pokemon~~
These could provide interesting consepts
Beyblade,Yu-Gi-Oh,Digimon
Like the duct tape from gungeon :>
I wouldn't mind a Yu-gi-oh based mod tbh
so they both charge seperately, but still are both activated with space
i was thinking something like that, like monkey glue
Someone in the reddit suggested Polymerization (Yu-gi-oh Card) And I was thinking maybe it could fuse two active items like a one time use void
You know what would be cool
probably best
i'll just hastebin
ah
after you mentioned it xD
i changed it
except the blue one you just posted
and it's reset to 1 inside each switch function
outside of everything
at the very start
where is waittime set tho?
and are ordered back to front to avoid repeating
the callbacks all have a 1 wait time
I'm trying to get it to cycle green-red-yellow-blue
i have 4 types
NotLikeThis
where di this yellow come from
RedSwitch's code is:
```Lua
      player:RemoveCollectible(redPots);
      player:AddCollectible(yellowPots, 0, false);
      Isaac.DebugString("switched from red");
```
The only problem?
using blue switches to green
using red switches to blue
using green switches to red
it almost works as intended now
so good
love iut
ok, rubber duck debugging
oh
where is waittime set? shouldn't it be set when it switches?
added a small waitTime to make sure the items dont switch around instantly
if the player has bluepots, remove it and replace it with greenpots
That's blueswitch
assuming those are being set correctly
```Lua
function silas:BlueSwitch()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:GetPlayerType() == char then
    if waitTime == 0 then
      player:RemoveCollectible(bluePots);
      player:AddCollectible(greenPots, 0, false);
      Isaac.DebugString("switched from blue");
      changed = false;
      else waitTime = waitTime - 1
    end
  end
end
```
should be
So that's right then
ah
my mod
also what is silas
did you change it from bluePots?
callback, function, item
```Lua
silas:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, silas.BlueSwitch, BluePots)
```
this is how you structure a MC_USE_ITEM callback, no?
"for some reason" what a shocker
for some reason active item switching doesnt work as intended
my mod is so close to done ._.
I'll let you know when my Fallen Ocarina will be out ?
(Source: Am a bro)
bros just do shit for eachother
nah that would be a real teacher
?
A real bro would teach someone to fish~.

what a bro
cathery, you rock! Thank's a lot ?
```lua
local modname = RegisterMod("Put whatever here", 1)
local item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Put the name of your item here")

local function delete()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:RemoveCollectible(player:GetActiveItem())
    return true
end

modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, delete, item)
```
code for one-time-use item
sorry then!
I can confirm that it works just fine
oh yep, ok! Thank you ?
no charge
like paw or iv bag
Yeah
should be
so it's infinite use with maxcharges="0" ?
it won't dissapear by itself
and run that function too
it will auto-use the next item
The dissapearing you have to do yourself
and the callbacks runs a function that transforms your item into the item in the next callback
Oh? Maybe it was patched or something. Does it disapear?
If you have callbacks for using items
ok so this is annoying
Works for me
I'll try on my own item
maybe i did something wrong
Let me try
should def be usable
Just like the potato peeler or whatever
i tried maxcharges="0", no bar but not usable
it's usable at 0 charges
It should then just be chargeless
ah, weird
yep, but it's not usable
i haven't messed with spacebar items
Does setting the charges to 0 in Items.xml make it not show the charge bar at all?
yeah, ok, thank to all ?
use the USE_ITEM callback, check if they have the right spacebar item, and delete it if so
can confirm, so easy
yup, easy code
It would be just one line
Yeah, just delete the item on use
you should use lua
Hi there, does someone know if there is a way to make an item a one time use one ? Or should i lua, on use and delete the item?
sounds like you should read dat log
it crashes my game and erases my save
every time I luamod in console
...lol
You missed a `,` there
nice commas
ctrl+S, for example
`player:AddCollectible(greenPots, 0 true)`
It also uses key shortcuts
Better for code, pretty much
just overall
Much faster
hastebin is better for code
It's much lighter
whats the difference
hastebin.com
No, hastebin
o
Oh, right, you didn't bother checking the docs
do you mean pastebin
you're missing arguments
jean is so right
ah
use hastebin
Put it up on hastebin
`AddCollectible(CollectibleType Type, integer Charge, boolean AddConsumables)`
So?
and I can't show full code cos there's 340ish lines
so yes
outside of everything
It's at the top of the entire main.lua file
I'm just going to go with "Show full code"
Are you sure the local is accessible from the function?
```Xml
<active name="Sulphuric Hydroxide" gfx="Collectibles_Green_Potion.png" description="Acidic Green!" maxcharges="0"/>
```
where's your xml
and in xml
```Lua
local greenPots = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Sulphuric Hydroxide");
```
Show full code
what's your greenPots
```Lua
player:AddCollectible(greenPots)
```
are you doing : or .
"bad argument #2 to 'AddCollectible' (number expected, got no value)"
¯\_(?)_/¯
Sounds like you've got some errors
and it also doesn't recognise my items by their name
for items etc
the game can't load any of my image sprites
So, Maddogs1, did you modify the charactermenu.png for your mod?
well thats odd
INB4 `Lose/Lose` mod
and wipes hard drive
inb4 mod crashes my computer
You need to find the 250900 folder for your SteamID in Steam/userdata
naisu
that's nice
there's automatic backups it looks like
Actually, the save isn't there if you have cloud enabled
(:
copy the whole Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+\
i think
yes
depends, is it on the cloud?
XD
ok so how do I back up my save?
hurray!
kek
save is back
welp i'm going to go ahead and make a backup ^^
trying that
Supposedly restarting steam helped somebody
fokin rip
rip my save
ayy
(again)
another victim of the update
the new update did a thing to save files
oh no..
my mod crashed the game and my save file is deleted?
You can't know the ID, i think the ID might change depending on the mods you have
Yeah, add your item in the code
wtffff
<@219159380094877696> you'll probably have to turn off all other mods if you want to give it through players.xml
<@219159380094877696>, if you don't mind me asking... Do you modify charactermenu.png in your mod?
Maddogs you can't know the id right ? maybe you need to give it in code
<@!83097725666590720> Oh wait, I misread. Though you said the angle 1-9 crashed the game, not the variant. My bad
items="id"
in players.xml
well it didn't take long to just iterate through 9 items
<@269950308606672898> how do you give your character the item?
would have saved you some trouble haha
ah
`007.001_Thick Red Laser` to `007.009_Brimtech`
what
I can't seem to spawn my character with my custom item
<@!83097725666590720> look in entities2.xml for that sort of stuff
he's almsot complete
for my second char
?
so you went for Silas :p
does it print out the map in the log now
yeah it's a very strange update
Since you have the build info on the title screen
https://gyazo.com/8838ce94ecf9c3c4ee14546fb6d22bac
Never seen this before
Yeah, I believe we have some sort of dev build of the game
the update did something to logging
Oh btw
noice
https://gyazo.com/c87d75975648697d7dad9e12cd5de994
Neeeew character
the parameter is even called AngleDegrees
I mean, I might have been wrong
but, the function even takes it in degrees, as it says
i am aware of what radians are
Yeah
that is called ShootAngle
Theres a function for spawning lasers
Have you ever had trigonometry in school?
Well
uwot
<@!83097725666590720> The angle is in radians, I believe
very buggy
Or it might be very simple and you just need to reason a bit
also the laser things are funky. LaserLength is always 0, SetHomingType() takes a different type of variable than HomingType is
it might just not have an attribute that we can access
Create a laser that will be a circle from the game, inspect it from Lua, see what it is about
Try using Isaac.Spawn then
fun fact: one of them is the pride laser
I've tried setting the Variant parameter from EntityLaser:ShootAngle() as some different values, 1-9 seem to be the only ones that don't crash, and none are circles
Try it
but the shoot angle feature works for a 360° laser around isaac ?
The laser will be circle with the right laser type I think?
Alternatively, create your own sprite, make it an effect and use that
There's an `IsCircleLaser()` function for lasers, but it doesn't seem to have a set method of any form
EntityLaser.ShootAngle?
¯\_(?)_/¯
Spawn an EntityLaser?
any of you guys having an idea on how to spawn a laser circle around isaac similar to a cirecle of protection  ?
is there a method to see wheter the "enter-boss-room" animation is playing?
ill look into it, thanks for telling me ^^
Or the game decided it'd be a good idea to run multithreaded and start a new run while the Lua is still running, resulting in a rare odd error
Otherwise, scayze probably doesn't properly detect a new run
Then that's fucked up
Well, if the mod crashes if you press and don't hold
your pc and my mods dont like eachother appearently
hmm, thatshouldnt happen o.o
what do you think
Do you mean "held"?
By "pressed"
your pacman game crashed when i pressed R is that normal ?
yaya, D: sorrey
Confused
I'm not even mad, I'm just
my bad
sorry wow xD
im dumb
"You have to run `Sprite:Update()` on the sprite every frame for animations to go"
Do people ever read what I write?
I...
also, do you know what Update() is for?
Thanks for answering, but i fixed it already ^^
You have to run `Sprite:Update()` on the sprite every frame for animations to go
Also, are you sure the first frame of the animation isn't empty?
Are you sure the function is hooked?
Also, how are you rendering it?
And have you checked the log for messages about "file doesn't exist" or smth?
Also, did you try playing the animation?
<@109624258317033472> Did you either pass `true` as second argument to `Load` or run `LoadGraphics` separately?
yes
is the subtype of an item pedestral the item id?
because it totally needed to be harder
and made it harder
what if we took the ultra hard challenge
What if we redid floors to look like Sonic Advance 2 Knuckle Levels
I see
there are plenty of different fonts for arabic but nothing meets comic sans level
Papyrus
is there an equivalent of Comic Sans for arabic?
what mod is everybody making
also we're so far off topic now
oh my.
sans skirt
sanskrit?
lmao
Teach me sand script oh wise animugamer
<@137942979649208320> should i start teaching people arabic on that site lmao
what a site
but no one speaks korean lmao
not many people speak english here
Da fak
i mean
this website is trying to tell me more people in saudi arabia speak korean than speak english
thank you
your english is pretty good
https://www.peopleperhour.com/
believe me i've tried
well i'll tell you this, there's just about no work here for a kid
i thought the saudis were all loaded
I don't know anything about saudi arabia.
shovel some... sand?
lol
Lul
snow in saudi arabia
or if you're a kid, go shovel some snow. that pays better than minimum wage usually anyway
it's like an hour of minimum wage work
poor as fuck
and i'm like
it's like. 7 dollars
http://steamworkshopdownloader.com/
in other words, i made a fucking mistake buying afterbirth and i'm not about to make the same mistake again
you do you, kid.
"neither am I, except for the circumstance where I am."
When you're paying for content you're giving them "their fair share"
and they let me down every time
i gave them their fair share of chances as well
<@116386733905412105> neither am i, but i gave the devs their fair share of money
you go to a steamworkshop item and press subscribe
i would like to know
I'm not a proponent of pirating.
do you know how to DL directly from the workshop ?
take the mod from that folder and then install it on the pirated copy
get a pirated copy of afterbirth+
so theoritically i could download a steam workshop mod from steam
except I shortened the folder name. it's a folder in My Games.
afterbirth+ mods are saved in My Games -> Afterbirth + Mods
i just refuse to buy afterbirth+
i have afterbirth and rebirth
where does steam save it's workshop data?
But getting that mod's data...
<@188494919197917184> I think you can append the mod data to your game's regular data?
?
no, jean meant the animation editor.
i refuse to buy afterbirth+ after how awful afterbirth was
oh you mean the animation editor
is there absolutely any way to get afterbirth+ mods without having the DLC itself
docking is definitely terrible <@145740433165647873>
so i have a question here
don't knock it til you try it
the docking is terrible
stuff*
huge mistake
I undocked it to try and rearrange stugg
so disgusting to use
Why is the animator tool
yo <@126590786945941504> how did you render custom sprites? i made an custom anm2 file, created a new sprite, loaded the anm2 file, and used sprite:render it, but nothing shows up ?
It's the reverse of a reverse of a reverse
thinking about it more does make you wonder though... you're right the ass is supposed to be on back xD
Yeah I've heard people use the term assbackwards before to me to refer to something that is the reverse of what its supposed to be... I assume its not a real word but certainly a slang term I've heard before
backasswards
The ass is **supposed** to be on the back!
It doesn't even make sense
Wait is "ass backwards" really a thing
<@126590786945941504> It's an assbackwards play on the word "Assbackwards".
Sometimes it crashes but not because of an exception, so it can't catch it
Maybe there's none
it doesnt even say that its writing a minidump?
<@229593818691928067> thanks for telling me ^^ Buuut, could it be that theres not even an error in the log? oO
Oh haha
it's just the log.txt
it tries to detect the language i suppose
sql ?
https://hastebin.com/gaqufenipi.sql
<@109624258317033472> my game crashes when i pick up your Buddy box :/
Why
Like
because it's back ass wards?
Also, why the fuck is the challenge called "backasswards"
The Binding of Benjamin Button is just Backasswards
tbh
The Isaac of Isaac
Bhe Binding bf Bsaac
The Binding of Benjamin Button
I prefer adultbirth
Please no.
someone make the binding of isaac: childbirth
yeah that sucks :/
It kinda pisses me off that we appear to have no access to null layers
mom's heels: WalkDown, WalkRight, etc.
let me find another anm2
right so if you want the animation to follow the body's direction of movement you would just do WalkUp, etc.
Either I don't know sometihng about sprites, or it has special handling
And with them playing in parallel
The player has separate animations for the head and the body
You might've noticed
However, they're also not handled normally
AFAIK, yes
because HeadUp, HeadRight, HeadDown, and HeadLeft are all automatically played, right?
No clue
I'm just wondering what would happen if you added a costume with those same animation names
Not from Lua
And you can't play them
069_chocolate milk.anm2 just has animations called HeadUpCharge HeadDownCharge
Like making an item that at least gives you an animation that lets you make charged attacks
Creating a new animation on the character
But like, y'know
Not sure
I think scayze means something more
you can't just give it the animation names?
what do you mean
Im almost thinking its not possible.
I'd like to know too
heh
like, with chocoloate milk or similar
Has anyone tried to animate costumes?
You have found **3** item(s).
!items
You have found **10** item(s).
!items
You have found **6** item(s).
!items
Damn, racking up the items
so you will usually get it in the middle-later game
Yeah I saw
Yeah, well, it is a devil pool item only
I have a challenge around that
The contract is really fun, imo!
I can't see why I would take that, except maybe in the Chest
Also that Contract passive is fucking brutal
I don't get it
The FlipskiZing of Isaac
right i didn't realize the connection >_>
and then just add -ing to it
Well, you have my name
why the Flipping of Isaac ?
Thanks for the thought, I guess ?
i want <@124088844181045249> to be an angel
damnit
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I want to be an angel
lol
What have you done?
NOOO
**The pact is sealed.** You are now a <@&207206454992568320> :smiling_imp:
i want to be a demon !
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be an angel !
fu robobaby
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I want to be an angel
Yeah, I'm not creative with names
Nice work, this looks good
The Flipping of Isaac ? Haha
Of course haha
You do get to write a lot in coding
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834783578

6 new items! now in 1500 lines of code, heh
At least it's something amirite
the only file that got modified for me was the exe...
I suppose
Makes sense, with the game showing the build info on the title screen
I think the log logs a lot more
Figured so
at least officially
there is none
I can't even find a changelog haha
Here's us hoping
RIP
Purely gameplay changes
Looks like absolutely nothing has changed in the docs :c
I didn't look at the changelog yet
Hey whaddup
Anything exciting in the new update?
Heyho, good morning everyone ^^
Hahaha, nice idea for a challenge
Plop
No active item for you. Only poop.
```local nope = player:GetActiveItem()
player:RemoveCollectible(nope)
player:AddCollectible(36)```
Bug fixes, as far as we know
Hey guys what was in today's update?
Adderline
seems like mostly bug fixes
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Version_History#2017-01-20_Afterbirth.2B_Patch_v1.06.0192
It might be bugfixes or game changes
Well, I'm only diffing the docs
Hopefully there will be some new stuff next week
shame
Yep, no difference
http://www.mediafire.com/file/hzp1ph5bc4rcawp/LuaDocs.7z
They forgot to remove the build number
haha, yup
what is that
http://i.imgur.com/HqOkAFj.png
I found the difference?
I, uh
In 10 min you can get it
I got it from  somebody else, but I can doublecheck if you want
If you still need it
I'm home in like 10 min. I'll see if I can send you the old doc
Unless the files I got from somebody are actually the latest ones
Welp, there appears to be no difference
I ran a diff and, well
discord what are you doing
i'm ready for the next one :p
i'm ready for the next one :p
Well, you're not going to diff it anyways tho
i didn't about diff >_>
yeah i'm on linux
yeah i'm on linux
That gives you a bunch of standard unix commands along with piping in your cmd
If you're on windows (like me), then install Clink
http://www.computerhope.com/unix/udiff.htm
`diff` command
use git or smth to diff ? what would you use
no haha
Do you have the old docs? D:
But I didn't backup the docs
oh I'm an idiot, clink includes diff, I could've done it
Then you run a diff on both directories
Then you download new files
First you make a copy of old files
Well
how do you diff the doc ?
hi
An update came out today
Oh hey
Along with what kind of things you're talking about
Depends on how you define "anything interesting"
SO, anything interesting come out since lua api
<@203215784770535424> I know about `Entity:GetData()`, I've used it in Demon in a Bottle :P
eg. what we are talking about on spriting
Honestly it depends on how complex the character is
EXTREMELY
Not changing an existing character, but a new one all together?
How hard is it to create a new character?
This is a weird question, but has anyone been able to change the Cilent name, like Antibirth did?
It's great, I wish I had known about it a couple days ago haha
Do what you want with it
Yeah it's just userdata
can mark things basically
yeah it's great
Good to know
Also <@126590786945941504> `Entity:GetData()` is just a table that's freely usable whenever you want to, for whatever purpose you want
I just haven't done anything Isaac in a couple days
There are 0 callbacks to remember if you have the docs heh
how could you? There's only like 10 callbacks to remember
Also, for some reason I had completely forgotten about MC_NPC_UPDATE
So he wrote/used a separate AI system
Alright fine
Steam isn't booted up
I do but I'm lazy x)
do you not have AB+?
It's the owner's IP, it shouldn't be distributed by others unless they state otherwise
But ?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838891822&searchtext=
don't do that, just dl it yourself
Can you publish the main.lua on http://pastebin.com ?
Oh haha
idk
i dont know how modding works .-.
Does it use any unusual callback ?
Yeah
with this API that's not that much
its 482 lines long
LETS CHECK
just subscribe and run isaac, it'll be in your afterbirth + mods folder. Wonder if it's well commented :^)
Edmund booster pack pls
I was hoping you could explain how to do it haha
i wish lol
Oh it's not ?
it's not mine bruv
?
Do you have a zip for that ?
Niiiiice
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838891822&searchtext=
Soooo boss
Very impressive
Right ?
kind of amazing that Mei happened with the ab+ API the way it is
The theory still holds
is kind of obsolete at this point though
Actually if you want to read on code injection, Missing HUD 2 is open-source and uses that
At least you can do more things with it
Shots fired x)
Probably easier to use that than the modding API to mod :^)
It's amazeballs
Code injection is so complicated
Hardware addresses everywhere haha
I'd imagine its quite the read haha
I wanna read some C++ hackiness
That's sad
ah, might be why plat god doesn't have it
Nah
Also, is Antibirth open-source ?
Its antibirth but it was a bugged unlock last I heard
Unlocked by defeating Satan as Bethany
is it like new or something?
It is Antibirth
Yeah i don't think it's antibirth even
RIP
http://antibirth.gamepedia.com/Urn_Of_Souls
You have found **5** item(s).

he's right, I can't beat it
No idea what that is haha
urn of souls?
ahem <@145740433165647873>
Can't beat that
You have found **5** item(s).

yo gnawed leaf, halfway to cheese
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
whatever, i'll still be lurking around to help people, but i'm gonna hold off on continueing my mod
if you're so lucky that the functionality is even there
yep half the time or more right now is spent finding ways to do what should be simple stuff
yeah
so it will _eventually_ be an ok api, but that time is not now
At least i know that they _want_ it to work fine and know that it's shitty
NotLikeThis
Fuck this, i'm gonna wait for some more patches before i keep working on my mod. I've ran into so many stupid issues that simply prevent me from doing what i want
I KNOW
God, all of this bullshit just makes modding not fun, when things _should_ work but randomly don't and i spend way too long figuring out that the issue i'm having is because the API is all fucked up
???


no surprise really
`laser:SetHomingType(orig.HomingType)` doesn't work. Says that SetHomingType wants a number, but got a userdata. UWOT
note that that site's docs are outdated
Ahh... Knew I was missing something.
it's `give k1` etc
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/md__i_1_doxygen_test_input_converted_test__debug__console__primer.html
weird
It's strange that this says Entity_Familiar instead of EntityFamiliar
that's really weird then
Say, how does one spawn cards in AB+'s debug console? Seems like it should be obvious, but I'm missing something.
yes i'm sure, it works with other stuff
```lua
function mod:familiarUpdate(fam)```
weird, are you sure fam is an entity?
```Lua
Isaac.DebugString(tostring(fam.Position.x)..","..tostring(fam.Position.y))
```
returns "nil,nil"
which position is it saying is nil?
```Lua
local cur = fam.Position:Distance(entity.Position,Vector(0,0))
```
:^)
is it .position or .Position
wtf
the position is returning nil,nil
oh that's it
sqr would work just as well :P
also
idk either
although i dunno how you managed to get distance to crash you
Good one nicolo
thanks
omg
<@!194259969359478784>
Yup, that's what it is
genius
the second param seems unused
`Vector(1,0):Distance(Vector(0,0), Vector(-1,0))` Returns 1
Oh my god i think i figured out distance
Hey, I'm planning on creating a brand new character (cthulhu) for the binding of isaac, however I have zero artistic skill, would anyone be interested in making the character sprite for me? not sure if I'm gonna publish the mod or not but if I do I will give you a huge shoutout for your help.
or is it not what i assume it to be?
also, is EntityLaser.LaserLength supposed to be 0 all the time for brim?
api is bad
any insights
I also had trouble getting distance to work
calling Distance on a Vector crashes ?
potentially
probably what bumbo does
true
only other thing i could think of is to make a "dummy" familiar that just spawns an NPC that does what you want
ok
fuck
You'll have to make the AI for it yourself
to the enemy
also i need him to move randomly
because alternatively you could make it FollowPosition
:)
crashes the game, so no
does EntityFamiliar:PickEnemyTarget() not do what you need?
make a familiar move towards an enemy
what are you trying to do?
familiars don't use paths it would seem
so it can't be made to be an NPC
then how
if you have an EntityFamiliar then it's not an EntityNPC, it's an EntityFamiliar
but that's an EntityNPC call
that I want to use fam.PathFinder on
i have an EntityFamiliar
no
Are you certain you have an NPC?
fml
why is familiar:ToNPC() returning nil
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
Game():AddPixelation(length)
how to add a permanent retro vision effect pl0x
i haven't messed with it
shoot how do we actually call PathFinder functions
untill we get full callbacks that's the best we can do
not perfect
yeah
check if the charge was full the previous frame and then is empty the next frame i guess
check for active item id
you'd have to check for its use using an update check thing
go in MC_POST_UPDATE i guess
<@!194259969359478784>  What about adding additional effects? Like if I didn't want to cancel it and just wanted to add some second thing.
the MC_USE_ITEM is meant to only work with custom items. The only way to change existing item functionality that i am aware of is to revert there effects or something
so check for cur to be greater than 0
note that it will likely find the entity that you started with
go through all entities and find valid ones for you
thanks
oh
```lua
for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do -- go through all entities in room
                if entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then --ignore fires etc
                    local cur = pos:Distance(entity.Position)    
                    closest = entity 
                    dist = cur
                end
            end
```
no docs function, just use this kind of thing
we can't cancel its effect
not really
Is there any way currently to overwrite existing active item functionality?
that's correct
Is it just me, or does ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM not work for non-custom items.
can't find it in the docs
how
questions don't have any intelligence
there are no stupid questions
I've got a possibly stupid question.
yes
can we find the nearest entity to an entity?
aye
Heyo
ayeverybody
mentioned in Tyrone's blog post and everything lol congrats!
<@109624258317033472> Man you're on fire with the mods lately
kek
_gags._
just use ifs
why would you need a switch anyway
Can someone grab some code and see what sounds best with me? :3
hmmm
Oh god, does lua not have switch statements?
and it didnt evne work for me
and when it occurs naturally (they dont have a main.lua) it does their sound
as what they did is copy the entire sounds.xml and rename their sound to the thing they wanted
And what they did doesn't work for me
Welp
lol
In fact i've only got one working sound mod
but they never actually use that ID
and they set a sound ID and use sound files
I've seen tons of mods with a sounds.xml
lol.
I really need to read the docs before posting those random-ass fictional functions
Shet xD
that isn't a thing
you cant create sound objects
Then you use Isaac.GetSoundIdByName
Oh
the other sounds are all under SoundEffect.SOUND_NAME
eh?
Like with everything defined in your `content` folder
They'll be moved to game files
Like regular sounds
haha
yeah, but how to then use them in Lua
Random guess, didn't actually check if that existed
And ? sounds.xml ? ?
Niiice
anyone know how to add custoim sounds? ?
?
and all things leave rainbow creep behind
and bombs spray paint randomly
it works with tech, brim, techx, tears and bombs
I looked into it for ages to get my paint mod working eprfectly
thats just how it is apparently
yeah haha
ok, thank you ? weird that that rgb is given in 0-1 and and the offset one in 0-255 o.o
so it doesnt look weird with a blue laser and a red impact
that's for the effect laser impact too
```Lua
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    local rainbow = math.random(1,6);
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_LASER and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 and entities[i].Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then
        if rainbow == 1 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
      elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 and entities[i].Variant == EffectVariant.LASER_IMPACT then
        if rainbow == 1 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then entities[i].Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
```
i  made my lasers random ranibow colors ?
how did you do that? ?
I do
yeah
SetColor wont work ?
Yo guys, whatsup ? does anyone know how to recolor EntityLaser?
Yeah right haha
not like it matters much tho
cheers. xD
You know you could also spawn an ENTITY_NULL
lol
what the heck is SOUND_CASTLEPORTCULLIS
Just call playSound(SoundEffect.OPTION, 1.0, 1.0) to play a sound
```Lua
function playSound(sound, vol, pit)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  local soundGuy = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FLY, 0, 0, player.Position, Vector(0,0), player):ToNPC();
  soundGuy:PlaySound(sound, vol, 0, false, pit);
  soundGuy:Remove();
end
```
Bit of useful code for anyone who wants it
Oh btw
wait no that doesn't make sense
...oh.
and I am doing it in the POST_RENDER callback
It plays one frame of the animation then dies
this is weird tho
:^)
yep, thanks
Yyyyup
Isaac is not an object, it's a namespace
`Isaac.WorldToRenderPosition` it is
...
Are you using : instead of . or the other way around? :^)
how is that a table haha
I'm passing it an entity position
dafuq
```calling 'WorldToRenderPosition' on bad self (Vector expected, got table)```
Also note that the moddingofisaac docs hosting isn't up to date, use your local version
wait why did i link that one of it
wtff xD
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/group___functions.html#ga7af3a968a47aff7f6bff8f918e463479
WorldToRenderPosition? ._.
Read the doc dude bro
yeah, they're different
uh how ._.
oh
You should use the Isaac.* functions to transform world coordinates into render coordinates
good to start somewhere
CSS and HTML are markup languages
I know I just started
kek
those aren't even programming languages
and C++ if you know how i think
Lua
Like CSS or HTML5
What does issac modding use
it renders it super far below where i want
actually, no wait
._.
of the screen
It renders the sprite in the very bottom right hand corne
That one seemed the most logical to me
I only have one problem now
Also it's a damn shame that we don't have a MC_ON_ENTITY_UPDATE callback
sorry
yeah, that's what I meant
Well no xD have the creation code be ran once, and the render code be ran in a POST_RENDER callback
so move everything outside of render and update
Right now you're just loading the same sprite every frame, thus resetting it
yeh
ohhh.
I mean no, you should create your sprite only once outside of MC_POST_RENDER and then render and update it every time in MC_POST_RENDER
cause then you get things like meatboy, where collision is tied to frames, and it's easy to clip around by just pressing alt
that's now a post_render
?
```Lua
function silas:PotionSmash()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:GetPlayerType() == char then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i]:IsDead() and entities[i].Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then
        local bottleSmash = Sprite(); bottleSmash:Load("/gfx/effects/green_potion.anm2", true); bottleSmash:Play("Flying", true); bottleSmash.Scale = Vector(0.6,0.6); 
        bottleSmash:Render(entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0)); bottleSmash:Update();
      end
    end
  end
end
```
also it's bad practice to be doing sprites at the same time as computational things
lol ok
'cause the game is rendered on top of it and overwrites it
He's saying you should be using the Post_render callback because otherwise your sprites get overwritten
nu? :v
Can you guess why it doesn't show anything ? x)
You draw a sprite before the game renders
a post_update
they're in the same callback
The one not using an entity
In what callback is your code ?
but it doesn't work when I make it a sprite and try render it
```Lua
entities[i]:GetSprite():Load("/gfx/effects/green_potion.anm2", true); entities[i]:GetSprite():Play("Flying", true); entities[i]:GetSprite().Scale = Vector(0.6,0.6); entities[i].EntityCollisionClass = EntityCollisionClass.ENTCOLL_NONE
```
and it works fine there
I'm loading the sprite onto a tear 2 lines earlier
well
I don't remembner
Or actually ..?
Oh no don't use any directory
XD
doesn't load anything.
Yeah like that
So it has to be post-render, meaning that your sprite will be on top of everything
```Lua
local bottleSmash = Sprite(); bottleSmash:Load("/gfx/effects/green_potion.anm2", true); bottleSmash:Play("Dead", true); bottleSmash.Scale = Vector(0.6,0.6); 
        bottleSmash:Render(entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0)); bottleSmash:Update();
```
Not that I know anyway
Unfortunately there's no way to give callback to a certain entity on-update
call update before or after render?
ah, then that was what I was missing
I think you have to call :Update() too
You load the ANM2 in a Sprite object, then :Play() the animation, then :Render()
Game:Render?
How do you jsut flat out render an animation to the game?
and I'm loading them in the same exact way
the other one doesn'ta
One of the animations works fine
Well this is odd
Bye then o/
It's just German for "welcome", that's all I know
Oh hahaha
We're cramping the modding channel with chatter, soz ;-; I'll be off guys, cya!
The guy I watch in regards to Isaac modding on Youtube starts his stuff off with Wilkommen and he's called Lyte, don't know where you got the LoL from ?
I mean, god I hate the direction that game decided to take, I respect it, but no thanks
Not at all, I don't even touch that thing anymore
You play too much LoL haha
.
And I fixed it x)
It's Lyte language.
That's German
wilkommen, that's some Lyte language, ahaa!
Oh <@126590786945941504> you're a demon now :E willkommen
But hi
Heeeeh not that I know
Is that klingonian? Hi ?
Plop
1 am here, spriting to Kanye is really fucking up my time, I'll be sleeping for five hours again ;-;
Don't worry, I'll be mean to them tomorrow, I'm too sleepy now
you guys are just being mean to kube now :c
quiet
nerd
I don't listen to music
https://gyazo.com/8069dd30ea3407d82a90b693e468bad9 Have a sneak peek
I hate how much time it takes me to sprite stuff, but I guess I'm halfway done with all the ones needed for the animation
Le music
Think about what?
What do you think cube?
You unpack it in content/gfx
BTW, in case anybody wants to use it
https://soundcloud.com/biot13013/neros-day-at-disneyland-8
What boss would this fit?
u can alrdy think what he would drop :3, but for me iits sleep time

ok beggar sprite done
who's got a neat mod for me to ogle
especially as the presenter
client group calls are the worst
Thank's man, I'll try to figure it out. I'm a little bit sad I'll not be able to force the pool but whatever..
Yes, <@271727018276683776>, Isaac.Spawn for a collectible pickup
tbh can someone make a custom tile sheet for the void? like I hate their lazyness behind it
Vortex you did the mod?
honestly it could even replace the void
is a floor that i think could definitely be added
KubeRoot, to spawn an item I should use the Isaac::Spawn() method ?
bc a blue womb floor
Don't remember, I think it was on the BoI server
who
do you know?
well apparently someone added a valid stage without replacing
with lua modding
you have to replace floors to add floors right?
just why
why the f did they double 3 frames of the beggar
okay
but idk if its possible
I mean my beggar idea is simple
I try to, but I get lost
Just read the damn docs
There's like 5 ways to do that
how did you detect at which directing the player is shooting?
oh, how did you do that?
interesting
When you press a shoot button you move all entities in the direction you pressed the button
ok...
After use you lift the item in the air
But it's supposed to be a voodoo doll
That's a placeholder sprite
cuz I dunt get it
what does this blood lamp thinggy do
really? I'd love to be wrong
The item is called the Fallen Ocarina. One time use : devil deal pool. On use spawn 1 item from angel pool for every 1 to 3 sacrifices you've made.
Supposedly somebody had success adding a valid stage
but are u sure u cant?
Actually
you can't add new floors, that's a feature I'd love to see
BTW shitty item proof of concept https://streamable.com/8i7ak
yup
you garbage bot
Not sure if there's a proper way to check for collisions
Adding a new beggar would be interesting
lol
No new beggar haha
Hmm ok, those mod tools still miss a lot of things, like counting how many sacrifices you've made
Hmm Question, would it be possible to add a new beggar?
But IIRC if you specify item ID as -1, it spawns a random item from the current room pool or smth
AFAIK no way to spawn a pedestal from a specific pool
Also, I'm a web developper but pretty new to lua, so I'm in the learning process ?
I'm also wnating to know that
Hi there, I'm new to discord and not sure I'm posting are the place but here it goes. I'm trying to develop an active item based on sacrifices but do not manage to find how to spawn items. Does someone knows how to spawn item pedestal from a specific pool ? Thank's!
there's a start of a documentation on the gamepedia
through the walls.
and then flew right through them
and it bumped into everything that wasnt a wall
I gave an entity gridcollision for walls only
Best of luck to whoever tries
has anyone documented the ab+ api yet
pretty much same
bloodlust is a huge tears up for u and ur familiars and ur other players
nah
basically the same
bloodlust
mega mush 30s charge
and alabaster box
mega mush has 12 room charge
Ahh okay, I figured Mega Blast had it, but I've never used it
(im still in afterbirth internally. i ab+ is not worth mentioning)
thats dumb
why does eden's soul have it
it's not the only one
Delirium and mega blast and eden's soul
mega blast. that is the only one
ooooh, no kidding? what item has that?
Just curious, doing an item called Killer Switch that consumes charges and deals damage according to how full it is
no. largest is 12
Is 6 charges that largest charge bar in the base game?
too true
God this api is so shit to work with
:v
any ideas why it works the opposite of intended?
```bats[i].GridCollisionClass = GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_WALL;```
they now just drift off into the void
seems to make them collide with everything EXCEPT walls
gridcollisionclass for wall
LOL
'id'?
Why on earth is it like that ?
dw
no that's what it is
I can go and check to make sure if you want
Yeah, `id="3"`
entities2
I forgot
Or entities?
Wait, was it entities2?
It's id="3" in entities2.xml
do you mean type 3?
Then they're not familiars
no
Do they have id="3"?
and when I do :ToFamiliar() on them, it completely errors
for some reason my familiars spawn as hostile entities
lol
dw, that's not the problem I'm having anymore lol
what are you trying to make fly?
I am so god damn confused
actually i need to make enemy projectiles "spectral tears" now and it doesn't work for that
also why am i spelling it entitys and not entities
cause i assumed that GridCollisionClass was meant for grid entitys, like rocks, and that EntityGridCollisionClass was meant for regular entitys
no idea
and it doesn't work
I did the first one
well then what is EntityGridCollisionClass for?
As I've said twice now
hopefully in your case one of those work
`player.GridCollisionClass = GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_WALL` works
`npc.GridCollisionClass = GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_SOLID` works
dear lord
it's confusing
there's EntityCollisionClass, GridCollisionClass and EntityGridCollisionClass
```bats[i].EntityCollisionClass = EntityGridCollisionClass.GRIDCOLL_WALLS```
sooo
sppp
this is weird
for a boss i made i used COLLISION_SOLID

oh i see, one is entity the other isnt
works for the player
no it's COLLISION_WALL lol
which is confusing
COLLISION_NONE and such are from the class not the enumerator
it want sto autofill WALL
OH, i see
Same as if I type it into zerobrane
well that's awkward
UMMM
lol
https://gyazo.com/4ca2235973c701bfb0aff15532e2ed8b
:^)
actually it's GRIDCOLL_WALLS
wtf

...it's collision_wall
not COLLISION_WALL
well it's COLLISION_WALLS
I put in exactly what he said into my code and they still bump into stuff
he said for a fly, which flies over rocks and such, right?
I did that, they still run into stuff like poop ?
dude i just told you
Only thing I can see about that is ```numGridCollisionPoints="12"```
otherwise entity.GridCollision = GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_WALL
eg for a fly `<entity gridCollision="walls"`
i think in the xml
Litteraly one item though. Gonna add more before I release.
how do I give an entity the ability to fly? :v
Yo jean
yes is very good <@178160616194834432>
<@229593818691928067> Thanks! <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
that isn't the player
How do you give an entity the ability to fly
all I see is the ordinary controls
new run
enable it
I install the crazy overpowered start mod
so, someone tell me how to install mods
like, I know the directory and all, but lets say
...For me atleast.
...Well this is akward...?
Oh.
If you don't want me to, thats okay too. I have to work on my mod so...
and I aint making a mod at the moment
oh
If Skinless Hush is going to be the Gaster of Isaac, then...
Take your time.
If you're not sure, thats fine.
weeeeeeell
So yeah. Maybe i can help with some sprites if ya want.
maybe i can help with some sprites and stuff, im a below average spriter but i think i could help or some- oh, okay.
or Tome
My question still stands :c
call me Runic
hey overtalkative tome of knowledge
Skinless hush is my new thing
wow
then why doesn't ```bats[i].Velocity = Vector(targets[i].Position - bats[i].Position);``` work
and thats an idle frame.
Velocity is a vector, right
only one frame i think
skinless hush has like
Oh. I thought this was PG 13 or something, hah.
ima look at skinless hush
who wants skinless hush to become a thing
no need to censor
am i the only person
anyways
oh
thats why
peridot is coding some sh*t
remind me what Steven is doing in the Modding channel
literally only me and my familiar in the room
Will go through if there are NO ENTITIES IN THE ROOM
Apparently looking for all enemies in a room then passing ```Lua

            if enms[e]:IsActiveEnemy() and enms[e]:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
```

eh whatever i have to take a shower cya
i wonder when there will be a binding of isaac flash texture mod for binding of isaac afterbirth +.
and duration is probably in frames
you're missing an end there
what
```LUA
function MyMod:FuckMyAssWithATwentyFootPole(player, cacheFlag)
    local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
    Game.AddPixelation(1)
  end
```
just made all my items i've made not work
Game.AddPixelation (integer Duration)
ayy
if you could i wouldn't know how
Mook can't you specify the duration?
Gah, this is annoyingly tough ._.
and how would you do that
The only way I see is applying it every x ticks
Permanent?
somebody once told me but i forgot
could someone remind me how to add permanent retro vision effect to an item
so ... GridEntity:GetType crashes the game, a way to get it is through GridEntity:GetSaveState().Type
sorry i never used it :p
<@229593818691928067> So, some of the other parameters for the TakeDamage function. Could I null that?
k'
If you really want you can give me some time and I can create a Lua iterator for that
<@229593818691928067> Just go from 0 to gridsize
lol
r...really?
player:TakeDamage ?
How does one make Isaac take damage on active item use?
is there a way to iterate over grid entities ?
YESS
and it was so easy too
Found a way to check if player is aiming anywhere whether moving or not ?
any way to circumvent that?
GetLastActionTriggers() is 'moving' if the player is 'moving' and 'shooting' at the same time
Hmm
whyyyyyy
except it was the items.xml why
i knew i was doin it right
```LUA
function Mooknkoyo:life()

end
```
gg wp
i spelled cache wrong
oh
yes
You did add the `cache="damage speed"` in items.xml?
~~don't even comment about indents please~~
sorry
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

  function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
   local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
      end
    end

    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.FuckMyAssWithATwentyFootPole)
```
oh yeah forgot to paste it
Give me the code then
first of all the problem is: one, it's taking too long to activate (as mentioned earlier) and two, i'm not getting -1 speed
okay anyways
i'm normally really good at finding sarcastic comments but wow i fell for that shit
sorry
an idiot
i'm
hah
oh
No but seriously, describe the problem or give me the code
And you don't realise the "I've sent you back the code" isn't a snarky response when I have no code?
You keep going with generic responses
I say something sarcastic
You give me no code
I DONT BELIEVE
NO
HOW CAN YOU
HOW
i didn't get a dm
uhhhhh
<@227262590697340928> You're not checking DMs, are you?
Don't tell me
no
cheers eatme
<@227262590697340928> Yes, I've sent you back the corrected code in DMs
..oh
Game()
<@219159380094877696> You're trying to index the global `Game`, which is a function
*i don't know how it would even be possible to fix that, i mean it's not like there's a timer for it to activate or something*
```attempt to index a function value (global 'Game')```?
*i mean the problem is*
*o ok*
I can't help you with just "my item doesnt work but apparently it works"
Well
cool
oh
Like this (placeholder) I made
You can use a separate image that has everything your mod needs
So no need to edit original spritesheet
Or replace the spritesheet entirely
You can change spritesheet ID on a layer
When doing custom character menu
Also fun thing I found
¯\_(?)_/¯
my item isn't activating immediately but apparently it was working
so
I thought you were talking about the identifier for the room's pattern
oh I see.
yes?
hey kuuube
Index of the room on the current floor
well by room index
<@116386733905412105> What
The starting room on next floor is always empty
can't you get the same room adjacent
The good thing is
good point
it won't update
but then if you change floor and go to the same room index on the second floor
Yeah, as long as you also check if the floor changed
you could just use the room Index
cheers
And it has no __eq metamethod
figures.
Because it creates a new instance of the Lua room object every time
Actually, no, oldRoom ~= newRoom
I had to use :GetData()
when I tried to do that with an entity
maybe
so I imagine i'll just need to check if oldRoom == newRoom
and that returns an actual room
cheers
Game():GetRoom()
how do i get it's 'index'
but what's the accessor for the current room >_>
you're in a new room
if the current room doesn't match the previous update's room value
on update save the current room
Exists exists, it'll tell you if an entity who exists in your table really exists
aka how to check if the room or floor(level) changes
i'm doing it an easier way, how do you check if a player leaves the room in any way
that just returned nil method exists ?
<@219159380094877696> Entity:Exists() worked for me
how to check if a player leaves the current room
Ok, simple question
im a dolt for not trying that sooner lol
Hmm
hey that seemed to work, thanks eatme
one) it's not subtracting my speed (-1) and two) it takes a while for it to actually do its job
broken vhs does work BUT
plot twist
so
ayo guys
local bats = {}
a table
What would it return?
entity:GetData()
how would I do this? :c
and if not, I want to remove them from the table
I want to check if the entities in this table are still in the current room
I'm spawning entities into a table, bats{}
Someone run me through this quickly
not variant
oh wait I actually tried entity.SubType tarot card
?
I tried that but that only does the tarot cards and not runes for whatever reason
PickupVariant.PICKUP_TAROTCARD maybe?
Hey I asked this yesterday but nobody seemed to know - instead of just writing 
```(entity.SubType ~= (Card.RUNE_BERKANO)) and (entity.SubType ~= (Card.RUNE_HAGALAZ))```
 and so on with every type of rune to check that an entity isn't a rune, is there anyway to just make sure it isn't a "Card" type at all?
seems fine
an integer that ticks down on an update function, when it hits 0, spawn?
What would be the best way to 'wait' between firing bats?
so i've looked into the xml files and found one with all the boss names and what i'm guessing is the VS screen images they use, i wonder if changing the actualy boss name on top does anything
But you could just as well Load another anm2
I replace the bomb spritesheet in Rock Bombs
You can
maybe you can mod the bomb animation ?
And by "custom bomb effects" you mean...?
ive found a decent way. But it doesnt synergize with much
Is there any proper way to add custom bomb effects?
hp is and has always been stored in an xml file
you can duplicate the attack events to add more of the same types, but nothing too interesting
which we have been able to do since rebirth
some attacks are stored as events in the animation data
is there any way to tinker with enemy data (HP or attacks) without the AB+ API (asking cause IIRC Godmode had managed to do it)
trudat
I did say it adds a `log` function :P
nbd
it's not the actual log
oh
I thought you meant that I had anm2 in resourecs and png in resources/gfx or something like that (which I apparently don't)
oh ok
It has no use there
No, that you mean, I forgot I had it in the base folder
Oh wait
Organization
what's the purpose of having your anm2 and png in two locations?
That you mean?
link to recent log messages?
kube
i can't wait for `require` to actually work, so i don't have to have tons of items in a single file
look.
if you don't want your username tracked, don't put --luadebug in the flags and the mod won't work
It's not like it put my name, surname, email, address, PESEL and others in there :D
It's not that bad tbh
gg win10
oh god i forgot that it could do that
Good thing it's only my first name ;D
Even better when you decide to say "fuck it" when installing win10 and it automatically fetches your real name from your microsoft account because you told it to
i'm just messing around with the idea
far too many
with this i could load data from other mods...
And yet, I wonder how many people do that
making your username your real name is just bad strats
The point is - there's no real reason to let you do that
Then it wouldn't be `thibaut`, but your actual name
of course it is man that's not the point
Look at you, what if your username was your real name
And, guess what, that'd also be at least mildly abusable
well that's what i want
That's the file directory
That's not the working path
```local path = debug.getinfo(1).source:match("@?(.*/)")
Isaac.DebugString("Path: "..path)```
-> `[INFO] - Lua Debug: Path: /home/thibaut/.local/share//binding of isaac afterbirt
h+ mods/hive/`
3. Why the hell would you want to access that stuff?
2. `require` isn't included without `luadebug` either, so you couldn't use that anyways
1. The working directory isn't the mod directory, it's the isaac directory
the API doesn't support it
Actually, 3
Two things
dude
...what
to access other mods
Why would you need to get the working directory?
to get the working directory
It also adds a function that lets you draw a line between two points
no i mean the variable debug
Keeping track of all messages and displaying the latest 10
It adds a `log` function that basically logs stuff on the screen
Alternatively, I have a debug mini-mod I can upload if you want
Isaac.DebugString(string) puts the string on the log
?
yes
is `debug` only available with the --luadebug flag ?
seems reasonable...?
Max number of bats: 12
<@160893636232347648> Yes, those are the ones that you have to edit, but if you want to add more frames, remove them, or change the way the animation rotates and scales, you'll have to edit the appropriate anm2 file
I don't even remember what was limt
i've seen that the unpacked files also contain png sprite sheets for the various enemies, are those the ones that must be edited to modify the appareance of the corresponding enemy ? or is other stuff needed for that ?
god damnit
did somebody say limt?
I can limit the amount of bats, huzzah
yay ?
that's the idea
Isn't that that chalenged guy guy always **technically** right?
technically i'm still right fok u
:D
Not "saved as plaintext"
just use sublimetext or notepad++ or something
XML is a human-readable format
Or rather
xml are saved as plaintext
But I'm 98% sure you can have a metamethod for `tostring`ing it
i'm guessing there are some tools out there that are needed to edit xml files, right ?
I forgot if that's exactly how it worked
Unless...
As long as both are string or have a tostring metamethod, it'll work
don't you need to `tostring()` the int?
cheers
`..` is the concat operator
string..int
how do you concat a string to an int in Lua?
sounds right to me
Right?
So that they include original stuff and your stuff
In which case you have to edit the built-in xmls
ye^
oh
AFAIK Bob doesn't have AB+
Depends
nope
so... this is probably a stupid question, but to add your modded stuff to your game, you need to move the folders where all your modded files are into the game's resources directory, right ?
If on AB+ you have to unpack all resources and move the `packed` folder
In which case yeah
Unless you don't care about doing it properly and uploading to the workshop
You put them in the appropriate directories in resources in your mod AFAIK
I just replace the existing files yeah?
Hey I forgot how to mod music in to issac
"What do you mean it doesn't work, look at all the working mods!"
kek
Or be a good person and not give Nicolo an excuse to ignore the glitch
You can either make a good mod
This is a serious moral dillema
The thing is
I'll just make another function to update the fire rate then haha
o
But MaxFireRate appears to be reset afterwards
it tries to change it, but it doesn't stay
mmm it's not in the "appropriate callback" I guess
Yeah, the callback runs
...?
which means it did pick up the cache
my log was outputting 'RateMeep'
<@116386733905412105> You say changing MaxFireRate in the **appropriate callback** works for you?
hang on though
aight, i'll try that
hmm
And set it in POST_UPDATE
SO just set a flag in the callback
how can it be broken if mine works
spill the beans
It should work outside of the callback
AFAIK
There is a way
No way to circumvent it at all?
MaxFireDelay in callback is broken
lol
told you eatme
is great
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mzkqp/afterbirth_lua_api_bug_megathread/ Yeah it is
firedelay is broken
but yeah
it does.
oh wait
but it doesn't
either way the damage definitely hsould
firerate does change.
maxfirerate.
cause broken
well firerate doesn't change
Any idea why the actual damage/firerate values wont change?
```Lua
function madCharacters:CapBats(player, cacheFlag)
  Isaac.DebugString("Meep");
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:GetPlayerType() == char then
     Isaac.DebugString("VampireMeep");
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then 
      Isaac.DebugString("DmgMeep");
      player.Damage = player.Damage - 1.5;
      if player.Damage > 25 then
        player.Damage = 10;
      elseif player.Damage < 1 then
        player.Damage = 1;
      end
    elseif cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
      Isaac.DebugString("RateMeep");
      player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay + 15;
      if player.MaxFireDelay < 5 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = 5;
      elseif player.MaxFireDelay > 29 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = 29;
      end
    end
  end
end
```
but the values still don't change
Yep, it goes into the damage/rate caches
means you're adding a callback to a method that's nil
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Meep
[INFO] - Lua Debug: VampireMeep
[INFO] - Lua Debug: RateMeep
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Meep
[INFO] - Lua Debug: VampireMeep
[INFO] - Lua Debug: DmgMeep
to check if it actually goes into the code
so I added debugging
ok
anyway this error:
"[INFO] - [MadCharacters] Error in PostEvaluateItems call: attempt to call a nil value"?
yup
casino games huh
used to be Ash Gaming but our company got bought
Playtech
who do you work for?
haha
Shush, I work as a game dev and like to keep up that habit
the semicolons are cute
XD
although i changed it and it still doesn't work
indeed you could
I could see the error with my mind's eye
._.
CapFireDelay CapBats
```madCharacters:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, madCharacters.CapBats)```
and aren't the arguments for the cacheflag callback player, caheflag not cacheflag, player?
outside of the code you've shared.
in the bottom
check your callback definition
changed that, still have same wrror
function madCharacters:CapFireDelay(cacheFlag, player)
function tophmod:evaluate_earthbending_stats(entityPlayer, cacheFlag)
also firedelay totally changes
it's pretty neato
I think you have your arguments reversed
firedelay is broken and doesn't actually change
char is the new character
```Lua
function madCharacters:CapFireDelay(cacheFlag, player)
  if player:GetPlayerType() == char then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then 
      player.Damage = player.Damage - 1.5;
      if player.Damage > 25 then
        player.Damage = 10;
      elseif player.Damage < 1 then
        player.Damage = 1;
      end
    elseif cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
      player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay + 15;
      if player.MaxFireDelay < 5 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = 5;
      elseif player.MaxFireDelay > 29 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = 29;
      end
    end
  end
end
```
just seems to not work at all
"[INFO] - [MadCharacters] Error in PostEvaluateItems call: attempt to call a nil value"?
holy snap I just went mlg pro on these skellies
god damnit, thank you
...
and just add the changes that would change your base values
check if you're playing as your custom player
in the cache update
what's his nuts will come in and throw a fit if you don't call it the right language
So any idea how I keep a constant base value?
yeah that, sorry
c++*
so it's probably  done in the lua?
the other characters in players.xml have nothing and apparently there aren't nodes for those stats
I want my character to start with 25 tears and 2.0 damage
so look at the other characters as examples
yeah
like their base stats?
uh
and that character's damage
How do I set the player's tears in the xml or whatever?
compared to clotties
they take 2 more hits to die with isaac's base 3.5 damage
so as far as HP goes, they're fine even for basement
for comparaison, a clotty has 15
the brim eyes have 20
10000000 hp
u have like 3 damage on basment 1 and they have like
but enemies that u need to kill like
the brim statues are fine in basment imo
yeha
both eyes are in womb
They're in both
the brim statues are sheol obstacles
or are brim eyes sheol i forget
they're womb enemies for a reason
don't put womb enemies in basment I
time to math
i could reduce their number
i have a feeling you won't be able to dodge those eyes at all
those eyes are evil
xD
yer goin too far.
but that might have been overkill
wanted to use the mega satan arms at first
this could be a interesting basement I boss room
and the firerate capping works, cheers
my friends ?
I like those ?
aaaaa this is good
aww
http://gfycat.com/ColdAlertBeaver
(yes i'm a slightly sadistic modder)
but it'd be fun to watch people rage at my creation *evil laugh*
oh....
YAY flying bats
not a terrible idea
brutal isaac
tbh i may make a less brutal version of this as a boss once i figure out how to tell Basement Renovator "this is a boss room"
gah, damn bats wont play their idle animation correctly
doesn't that sound *fun* ?
no thanks? ?
imagine this as your second room of the run
lol
like that
i wonder if i should make a mod that replaces the rooms with brutally hard ones
pretty sure it worked before that.
must've been in the totear() update
so it works now? ._.
[INFO] - Adding collectible 1 (The Sad Onion)
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Nice meme!
try run it then
lol
```lua
local testmod = RegisterMod( "Test Mod", 1 )

function testmod:evaluate_cache(entityPlayer, cacheFlag)
  if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
    Isaac.DebugString("Nice meme!")
  end
end

testmod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, testmod.evaluate_cache)
```
Yeah before, and about 4 other people have said the same
did you try the most bare-bones test
its bugged
but yeah, MC_EVALUATE_CACHE for CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY never ever calls
while MaxFireDelay is what that cooldown gets set to each time it resets
right, FireDelay is the cooldown for the current shot
maxfiredelay, since firedelay is the current charging time thing
20 bats <:plum:259939492008296448>
other people say the same
are you using FireDelay or MaxFireDelay?
the cache for it doesn't for me
the firedelay works
uh
The bats will do damage similar to dead bird ?
How many bats should he start with, and what should the max number be?
so annoying that the firedelay cache doesn't work
lol ?
yey ? Glad you got it working
thanks alot jean ?
it only has the idle animation playing atm, but who cares ?
not the animations etc
I was missing something in the code
my god it finally wortks
i just click 'replace' then navigate to the .png and choose it, yeah
ok then in vampirebat.anm2 -> Path="familiar/vampirebat.png"
same as the actual game has
and moved the vampirebat.anm2 to /gfx
I removed the familiar/ from anm2path
```
- mod_folder
    - content
        - entities2.xml -> anm2root="gfx/"; anm2path="familiar/vampirebat.anm2"
    - resources
        - gfx
            - familiar
                - vampirebat.anm2 -> Path="vampirebat.png"```
hold on.
you already are checking the same so you dont need to get it 2 times
like stat stuff.
"Tear" stuff
im adding it with my uh...
i have multiple things below.
shouldn't need the 2nd if statment
always hated the spriting part haha
sigh, just can't get it to work
so something like this?
* `player:GetName()`
I changed the entities2.xml as you suggested and moved the .anm2 into the gfx folder
still no loading ?
Ooooh. Okay.
```if player.Name == "Maggy" then
    player:ClearCostumes()
end
```
I mean for a "specific" character.
^
```local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:ClearCostumes()```
idk how to code that in.
well edit the anm2 to say "vampirebat.png"
Its got to do with EntityPlayer::ClearCostumes()    but uh.
I've done that about 3-4 times
well in the editor click on your spritesheet then Replace and select it again
Hey guys, how do i make it so the character i have has no "starting costumes"?
I chose where to save it
wait, what? xD
the path
do what?
did it do that after you selected the spritesheet in the Animation editor ?
so how can I fix it? :v
but mostly it's the path in your vampirebat.anm2 that doesn't work
if you ever have entities other than in gfx/familiar you should change `<entities anm2root="gfx/familiar/" version="1">`to `<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="1">`and 
`<entity anm2path="vampirebat.anm2" baseHP="0"` to `<entity anm2path="familiar/vampirebat.anm2" baseHP="0"`
well
worked hard on that vampire character haha
>_>
haha it's mine now !

of course
Sure, but no stealing :v
can you upload your whole mod directory ?
And also probably won't work on other systems
xD
which would be pretty silly
you have your users etc in ur folder xD
and the xml path is /gfx/familiar
that might not be your problem but if anyone else uses your mod it won't find it
the path for the xml is mymod/content
The path for the animations is mymod/resources/gfx/familiar
unless
so it basically checks TboIMod .. .. .. .. .. Users Maddogs Documents My Games...
Oh yeah the pathing is totally off
^
u know that isaac checks in its folder
Yeah you have to sprite load then make Him play his animation
`<Spritesheet Path="..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Users\Maddogs\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\MadCharacters\resources\gfx\familiar\vampirebat.png" Id="0"/>` wth man ^^
Cos I want to load an animation not a sprite, if you get what i mean
does that have animations though?
Then try to use sprite loading as done in the mod tiniest horn

yep
You have the anm2 file and the png for the animation ?
```Lua
local vampBat = Isaac.GetEntityVariantByName("VampireBat")
      local batty = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, vampBat, 0, player.Position + Vector(5,5), Vector(5.0, 0.0), player);
```
Works perfect for me
ah ok
I had similar problems when i was trying to make a custom familiar ?
thats why I said its not the familiar spawning, it's the sprite/animation
There are plenty of familiar mods that use the sprite:load() ( or something like that )
I've tried that too nick haha
try spawning in a familiar that isn't your own. If that works then you know its not your spawning code but maybe the .amn2 file. If that doesn't work too then you can narrow it down
I've done the same as two of them and it still didn't work :v
I have
You still have to load it , i highly encourage downloading some steam workshop mods
I'm not using any function to load it, it's tied to the entity in entities2.xml
If not, what fonction are you using to load the sprite ?
The entity is loading fine, but it's sprite isn't
Nope :/
Check the log.txt , might give you an answer
anyone know how shockwaves work ? (rocks)
Damn familiar sprite won't load :v
probably
does basement renovator allow you to make rooms that will only be used for bosses ?
So kube why couldn't you just tell me I'll get that same number? I know thats soemthing that will happen if you do it incorrectly. Thats exactly what I'm trying to fix.
Then why the fuck are you trying to mod stuff
If you can't handle understanding what might the function called `GetEntityVariantByName(string)` do
Ofc they tell you "shit"
not what they do
they just tell you what functions there are
the docs don't tell you shit dude
And find the function that will give you the variant of your entity
You instead read the docs
>_>
**YOU DON'T**
how would I add my own DEAD_BIRD
Yeah, it's simple
I mean FamiliarVariant.DEAD_BIRD for example
Do you mean the enum?
How would I add a new FamiliarVariant for my familiar? ._.
Then repeat it, but before the second batch of 4 numbers, exit and continue
generate 4 numbers
Go into room 2
Generate 4 numbers
Start a run
Then second test
Just try it, run the code, run the run, generate a few numbers, exit, continue, try again
*sigh*
oh nvm after 4th download it finally worked
well since I'm using the decoration seed which should be the same for seeded runs it should work
If you don't then I have no clue what the fuck are you going to do with it
As in, if you use that seed later
You'll find out you completely fucked up the RNG
<@150336707609231362> Try using it with seeded runs and continues :P
Whatever the function and enums are
but now its working
do you mean ```GetLastActionTriggers()```?
also the fact that half of the tools outside of AB+ doesn't seem to work doesn't help my salt levels
You're fucking the hell out of the built-in RNG system right now
I mean
When I said "entirely wrong track" or what was it I said
*sigh*
`getActionTriggers() & actiontrigger_shooting ~= 0`
thanks
<@126590786945941504> I figerd it out and got what you where saying. I needed to do seed=RND() then use seed:SetSeed()
I have, I never knew how to make actiontriggers work
it's more the fact that you're forced to pay 10 bucks for an addon to get an API that could have been perfectly released seperatly
There's a bunch of functions for that
basically, i want to spawn a familiar that moves in the direction I'm facing when shooting
Well, check the docs
that, sure
and also how do you get which direction
Do you mean ActionTriggers?
Kube, what's that command to check if a player is firing?
lol
"AB+ bullshit" because you can't download a fucking zip file that's completely unrelated to AB+?
....i'm really starting to get salty about this all AB+ bullshit
Now I just need to figure out how to make familiars work
http://gfycat.com/JampackedDirectIndianringneckparakeet
finally got my own chraracter to work
yeah I am haha
unless you're using AB+
if you can get the tools to work that is
lol
Time to get modding 8D
fuck this shit
yay it still shows an error
this is getting a little bit annoying
Redownload
So your internet f'ed up
Assuming you mean 25772KB by that
The file is actually 39.1MB
25772 Ko
How big is your zip file?
like really, the fuck's going on ?
why the heck does winrar give me an error message then ?
<@150336707609231362> I'm sorry, I can't handle myself today, I'll let somebody else help you, but from what I know you're doing something entirely different from what you should be doing
what the fuck ?
It is a valid zip
So Kube, do you have any idea as to not discard it?
and i'm pretty sure AB+ one, because of the new API shit, won't work for me cause i don't have AB+
Though give me a minute to download
I'll test
and this one has a broken zip
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/3ze00o/the_basement_renovator_a_new_contract_rc1/
i tried to use this for AB since i didnt got AB+
And the downloaded zip opens fine
From your source you posted. its a zip
So I went with the closest guess from "everything", that is, the game's packed .a files
also i don't have AB+ lol
Well, "the compressed file where everything is there" could refer to anything
....wait did i got it from the wrong topic or something ?
It's... Not a zip, dude
the compressed file where everything is there
So how do I not discard it then?  doing rngSeed=RND():SetSeed() returns nil. since it dosent return anything
What zip?
yep
...what
the afterbirth's zip is broke for me
Unofficial one
Also, here's an apparently updated version https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2703/basement-renovator-for-afterbirth-plus
i'm an idiot, you"ll quickly notice that lol
And still don't know how to use it?
That tells you exactly how to run it
So, you've read the post
huh, 2 years ago
this thing to be more precise
Because that'd break seeded runs
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/2qqq96/the_basement_renovator_v10_release/
Even if you were to use that instance, that'd just be stupid
the subreddit
You're getting an instance of RNG, settings its seed and immediately discarding it
its just not changeing
<@126590786945941504> could you atleast try and say what could be the problems? I'm getting no errors from it
Where did you download it from?
:/
but i have no idea how it's meant to work
i just downloaded it
<@160893636232347648> What's your problem with basement renovator?
I'm not even sure where to begin explaining the (potential) problems with that
I'm just out
does anyone know how to run Basement Renovator ?
yeah
Is that your actual code?
`RNG():SetSeed(Game():GetRoom():GetDecorationSeed(),60)`
Wait hold on what
after you put the seed for SetSeed() it also asks for a integer (shiftIDx)
shiftIDx?
do you know what the shiftIDx is?
hopfully
Try it out, I haven't dabbled too much into RNG() myself but there are people here that can definetly help you
I have it set the seed on player initilization. Could that be a problam?
Should*
nope
What does the log say about it? Any errors? Stuff not returning things it shouldn't?
RNG():SetSeed(Game():GetRoom():GetDecorationSeed(),60)
What's the way you've written it
I cant do that if I cant set the seed
Best*
It's the beat workaround rn probably
Use the RoomDecoration as seed <@150336707609231362>
How does one use the RNG() stuff properly? I've tried setting the seed but nothing changes
You just create new file, import spritesheet, add animation, add layer, insert frame, select that frame, select what you want from the spritesheet and bam, you've got a static one-frame animation
Nah
Is the animation editor in the modding tools complex to use?
I'm downloading that for sure once I get home

I love the way you can quite see red http://i.imgur.com/g6IveOi.png
I might upload it to the workshop just 'cause

It reminds me of those Ascii rouge likes
Dude, that looks sick ? What is this for tho? just playing around with shaders?
The womb looks awesome with this http://i.imgur.com/ovZQjgj.png
Yo. Good morning everyone ?
I'd try changing codes and framerate just in case that's the problem
And if that doesn't help, then ¯\_(?)_/¯
Also, http://i.imgur.com/DhwjktW.png
And use the screen-capture-recorder and virtual-audio-capturer
Install recording devices
Configure it
Video capture
Go into task settings
I know what to do
Holy crap ShareX make this lag
Ayy bubbles are fun
https://streamable.com/5iaxk
It's even better now
ohno
I might've hit a sweetspot http://i.imgur.com/my4TMLi.png
That's pretty cool
Seems like you can do a lot with that
Though task settings are global
Yeah, just found it
So yeah, either workflow settings or task settings
Oh it **IS** in the Task Settings
Though, actually
And then Image->Effects
You need to make a workflow
Where do you find that stuff?
You can apply various filters directly to your screenshot before uploading
holy shit
ShareX has image filters http://i.imgur.com/waQu4lX.png
Also fun fact
ShareX is best for short videos
But ShareX is the best for this
Stuff like ShadowPlay and whatever are good for recording long stuff I guess
Thanks a lot, I've been searching for a light screecap program ?
ShareX and OBS are the best free tools for screen capture. Depening on lenght and screenshots. Although OBS doesn't work with Isaac for me
Like seriously, nothing beats ShareX for stuff like this
ShareX
Oh woops was that a double send
Hey <@126590786945941504>  what software are you using to screencapture?

Alright well after some playing around with the scaling and shit I think I'm okay with it rn. I'm still struggling to make proper range caling I think, plus I should cap it, but
(the reason being, i don't have AB+ and Antibirth/Godmode were the only mods before it that i know about that have new bosses)
but i fear i'm gonna get my brain fried
i also will really need to know how Godmode or Antibirth were coded cause otherwise i won't be able to make my NEO Bosses mod idea...
so compiling all the resources folders where the unpacked files are located into one folder in a zip archive ?
If you want to upload mods to the workshop, you will **have** to modify them properly in a mod folder
i'm barely starting to learn how to mod isaac
probably, but i just wanna be sure i'm not editing the wrong thing
Doesn't it work something like putting a different version with the same name and directory path where the root is the 'content' folder of your mod?
So, while looking through the unpacked files, i see that there are image files that are the sprite sheets of the various enemies and elements in the game, do i have to edit those to change their apparence in game ?
or TearHeight
Also TearHeight
So Range Up means modifcations to either FallingSpeed, FallAcc or both?
Never forget teh spongebob
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/667442149630345217
:>
And why the hell were people expecting a highly-polished API at launch from nicolo?
Yeah, the API isn't good, but it's good enough for now
Andthat they're aware of the issues
I feel though sometimes people forget they're a dev team that have their stuff to do aswell
Modders are bitter, angry people, but the API was missing some important stuff, still is.
Also because people exaggerate the issuas
They didn't completely go "No, guys, you don't understand, the API is fine, you just have to start modding those things"
I'm not pissed at Nicolo simply because **somebody** is working on the API
the releases and all
in all honesty I can sort of show some udnerstanding towards the team with the events they had to cover
Yeah, but I know some people who decided t owait until people had figured some of the api out and then get imto modding, so at least they'll be pleased with that
I feel like having a tutorial on how to begin modding the game is worthless now that the community figured stuff out. I'd be way more interested in the advanced stuff. Hopefully he addresses that somewhat at least.
<@227262590697340928> Are you talking about the framework or what?
So it's just a tutorial on the use of some tools?
Well.. about time, I hope they adress the documentation lack on the stream or at least some of the stuff the API lags
http://tyrod.com/post/156051051704/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-megapost-2017
No, it's a shitty tumblr post tweeted by tyrone IIRC
<@126590786945941504> Is that post on reddit?
What thingy?
because boy do i want to
also how in the hell do i use the thingy you created
oh cool
So Tyrone will be making a tutorial modding stream
huh
Ohshit, I just read the megapost
;-;
yet there's somethin going wrong
i cant find any err's in the log
hurt me
go eat some spinach
go
okay
<@236834773211807754> It means my wizard powers are still weak and I need to eat more spinach
how do i use kube's thing that he made
eehhhhhhg
what does that mean
I'll rewrite that I suppose it is better to make it player.FireTear()
*cough* I actually have set it up as an Isaac.Spawn entity *cough*
id rather play in the sandpit and make sprites
There's northing stopping you from mastering the art of magic yourself
But
Coding is magic and we're wizards
You guessed it
how does coding work. you're all a bunch of wizards.
Game also has a spawn function with a different assortment of arguments
sounds unfun
Isaac.Spawn(blah blah lots of garbage)
you'd have to set up the entity by hand
is there a way to spawn a tear without it automatically doing that?
for better or worse this is true
so it takes on the player's tear properties
FireTear acts just as if the player had fire the tear
the player's variants?
Hmm, on a side note what if I'd want a spawned tear to take the player's variants howd that go? Has someone tried it?
thank god
so you don't have to manually add that in
neat
ah, it does seem to do that
Okay well I could play around with FireTear a bit then, I'm not rushing to manually add item conditions ;-;
cause manually doing that would be really not a fun time
might be worth testing
That would depend on whether or not Player:FireTear() has the chances for those affects
Also morning guys
How would I go about including the player's tear variants in a mod? I mean when I splash tears around me if I wanted to use some tear effect the player has (Tough Love, Common Cold etc) would I have to go through ifs to check if they have the item and manually tell them to spawn that type of tear?
(assuming you mean without code, cause doing it with code is surely possible but likely not worth it)
try dling a mod that adds a character with items and see how they do it
truthfully idk i haven't messed with characters, i've heard that you can't have more than 1 modded character anyway
carefully
how do you make a character that doesn't have d6 and has two items
ok so
i may be
you there
hey chalenged
*cough*
thats pretty ambitious for your first character huh
its my first character ^_^
he can also use his active item (6 charge)  to transform into a giant bat/man hybrid that shoots black lasers and bats all around
giving it back to him
and then slowly drain the life from them
the bats will fly erratically into enemies
he will spawn bats
how do you make a character start off with two items and have the item not be the d6
s u c c
So whats he gonna do?
http://gfycat.com/JampackedDirectIndianringneckparakeet
Elijah sprite finally completed ?
?
oh shut up
it's `Mooknkoyo:life()`
```LUA
function Mooknkoyo.life()

end
```
check your ends i guess?
weird
<@!83097725666590720> It's a local variable, but it's not in any function. ```local MrGreenman = RegisterMod("MrGreenman", 1)
local game = Game()
local curRoom = nil```
i'm sure there is but i'm dumb
Hey, instead of just writing ```(entity.SubType ~= (Card.RUNE_BERKANO)) and (entity.SubType ~= (Card.RUNE_HAGALAZ))``` and so on to check that an entity isn't a rune, is there anyway to just make sure it isn't a "Card" type at all?
That good for a mark?
https://gyazo.com/40b7eba0b59386538584d79686c46260
See ya o/
my child
I'll be back eventually, don't worry
g'night!
aww
Good night to yall o/
Anyway, time for me to go to bed
Just put it at the top right of his head
Isaac has no visible neck though
but at the neck makes sense XD
Would make sense ?
Two tooth marks on the top of his head
it feels empty ._.
should I put a scar or anything on the back of his head
hahaha ?
looks like it's getting there
I wouldn't say "epic" *yet*, but it's alright ?
Yeah it's alright
You said "this looks epic" x)
http://gfycat.com/MildAnxiousHarvestmen
I'm not that good at shading so don't expect it to be epic haha
Tell me what ya think, and if anything should be changed/touched up
ok
Yes please
I'll make a gif
OK this looks epic
havent even done the sides yet haha
still making the back of the cloak
not quite ready yet haha
nice maddogs i wanna see it XD
xD
eggman is ready
IT WORKS
ughh
Costume has no errors but isn't applied
where is curRoom declared?
Oh man this will look nice
Trying to replicate an effect similar to Toxic Shock.
Then why is it the rest of the code in the if statement running every frame?
will also trigger on teleports etc
yeah that should work
```if curRoom ~= game:GetRoom() then
      curRoom = game:GetRoom()``` This should be useful for telling me when a player moves to a new room, right? Because right now, it just runs every frame.
XD
I feel out of touch...
of course
ofc?
ofc i would credit you ?
Yeah, I could do it :D
sadly im a lua noob XD
i was wondering if anyone could do the code for a small item mod ? it adds a spacebar item that has a 3 room charge and when used summons 5 flies and puts a banana skin at isaacs feet when an enemy touches the banana peel it gets stunned or confused for a while :D
the spacebar item would be a banana (i will do the spriting)
?
Like an upside down chross in another color?
Should I add anything fancy to the cape tho?
I'm doing that now bonkers
Hmm
its fine
well idk, sorry
<@219159380094877696> If the cape was a costume you could make a cape.
just says use it :/
It says nothign on how to use it
check the post on the top of the reddit
no idea
<@!83097725666590720> When you say use RoomDecorationSeed what exactly do you mean? Use it in what way?
Might have to make a costume for it or something
its the same for every character
The only sprite that actually changes when facing backwards is the head
He does... :/
he shouldn't maddogs
i haven't tried the workaround myself
the top post on the subreddit mentions it
well this sucks
i don't have the docs up
so I can't make a cape...?
Isaac uses the same sprite when walking up as he does when walking down
....oh
right?
oh wait. I get what you are saying replace RNG():Random with RoomSeed():Random
weird
because I cant set the seed
does it so happen to be the fact you cant set the seed?
use the RoomDecorationSeed cause right now RNG() gives the same value everytime you reset it
ohthatsgood
Is there ?
There's a bug with RNG() right now
I'm just trying to make it random but it keeps outputting the same number
<@150336707609231362>
Looks like a pretty normal RNG to me
What do you want to do with it ?
Nah just kidding
RTFM ( ?° ?? ?°)
No-one online currently sadly
Anyone know how to properly use RNG()?
well that errored
and oh lol
man shading adds nice depth
It had two periods, instead of one for the .png file.
Was a problem with the name I had.
Nope.
I can help you a little, I'm a tiny bit ahead of you
probably
Probably something with the XML.
My character now works! Except his spritesheet makes him invisible.
are you addign a frame and clicking it?
get it in the sprite sheet?
Because I made text for the item I am making, but when I finally get it on there. It won't show up.
Rhe
then delete the fly anms <:plum:259939492008296448>
Animation editor is really bugging me.
Nah, a fancy vampire has it clean and sharp
Also wondering if the bottom of the coat should be jagged or not
It's hard to visualize
Oh yeah right haha
Bear in mind how huge the head is haha
I think the collar can actually be smaller, on the first frame
I think that much is fine
I can extend it a couple pixels down or to the sides
Also should I make it longer in any way or..?
Oh you mean like that
I count 8 on screen and 2 off screen for each
Except maybe if you want super elaborate animations
https://gyazo.com/403ded7bddc257c0a6ad60d6382864f1
Nah the costumes thing do that for you
And costumes also have 4 if I'm not mistaken
so that'd take code
and I'd have to sync up the animations
Isaac has 4 though
I just see that Isaac has like 8 different walking animations and costumes seems to have like 2
I get your point, heh
Well there you go then
sure can
Can't costumes be animated ?
That's indeed an animation
and when he moves and the cape flutters, matrefey? ?
anybody have an issue where attempting to disable all mods with tab crashes the game?
A costume has 4 directions heh
yeah, but when he turns sideways..?
All of that can just be a costume
If you just want a cape being held by a hand at the height of the mouth
Only costumes, not animations
but it'll take coding etc
I can probably do it with costumes and animations
It'll be something I invest time in once the main mechanics are done
I can see how it might work, that's the thing
Just sadly it's very tough to do
too
I know what you mean
I know what you mean Gryphling
I know... I can see it in my mind, but just don't know how to say it...
yup, it surely looks nice
;D
Nice reskin of Charm of the Vampire you got going on ( ?° ?? ?°)
Wrapping around the head will be tough, hmm
you know how in Vampire movies with capes, especially the cheesy ones, the cape's top comes to new the vamp's mouth, hitting about the edge on either side?
Ahh I see what you mean
yeah
it still doesn't quite look like it's wrapping around in front of his head...
Is this a new character?
Better?
https://gyazo.com/b8ea0aa8eb8c64b60eea41efbc7ed223
OK i got it
Actually hang on a bit
ok, how's this
lets see
ah
wrap around slightly
more forward?
can you make it look more forward? if that makes sense
Too much collar? Or should I add more?
https://gyazo.com/7cb5a2a0785e713808d1716609bdf084
ok, another one then
I think a more pronounced collar might look good
I like the last one the most
damnit melon.
And should I add a little flick to the ends of the cape? or a more pronounced collar?
I prefer cellar to burning basement

Guys, which is better
Not that I know of.
there have been whispers
Yep I am
HI all ? There are french developpers ? ?
Once I get the character working. I will try to fix up the sprite, and make it look better.
There you go haha
It was before his portrait picture.
Found it.
O
Blue Baby has soul hearts
Yeah right, I only said that off the top of my head haha
you mean players.xml?
I think it was armor. I did that, but all characters have only black hearts in XML
That would be in characters.xml
But also you can just go see in those XML files you talk about
I don't remember
Maybe armor actually
soulhearts ?
What are soul hearts called in XML? I want to give my character soul hearts.
RIP indeed
rip
I do all my items my own hacky way
I did tho
you'd have to ask Kuberoot
then I can't help much with that
ah
That's Kube's framework for passive items
kuberoot made it
its for stat changes
that's a very strange way to put an item in
items["The Bread"] = {
    Damage = 0.5,
    MoveSpeed = 0.5
    }
Oh there it is
I don't see a bread
the bread?
https://hastebin.com/ipuceyonuk.lua my code is not working, Everything else does, but the The Bread item does not.
What with?
can you halp?
mad pls
dang, his character sprite is almost perfect
cya
Bai
Alright guys I'm off, cya

Grats on the character Mad ?
The tail on the G looked like an R to me or some shit
yeha
black backdrop
oh, sorry.
just gozen
r
Box of Friends
?
Alright, irony Grozen means litteraly ugly in my language
where did you get the R from
Man, now I wanna fix the sprite and text on that. It's supposed to be Monster Friends or smth but didn't have timeand it looks really blurry and hate how her hand stands on her hair. But no. Code now.
Grozen?
http://i.imgur.com/j6UtdDT.png
<@126590786945941504> I removed all of the code and did what you said, but it still is not doing what it is supposed to.
Ayy, Vi
oops
> tfw you did one single mod and it's a Red Hot Chili pill
I still havnt figured out to get the sprites to work
since I don't know if we can find the font anywhere
but yeah taking letter is optimal
Hate the letters on Monsters though
https://gyazo.com/1b893bb9f0a44306f34818563e346c36
Here I think I made this on the day AB+ came out lol
hand made one
ooh new character what will he do?

I think Ihad something like that too actually lol wait
E from eden, L from magdalene, etc
Perfect
https://gyazo.com/662817536e547fdf996a8b31b959e8d0
Oh, haha, I made the character sprite by hand but not the text
I thought you ment sprite by hand
when you said by hand
I made the character from scratch, but the letters from others
Pretty not bad
but it limits it;s looks ?
At least I can program pretty good ?
oh
And resize them and then clear pixels
haha
That's exactly what I did ender
it'll be great
take text from other letters in the game
If you make the H a bit smaller
I wish I could draw anything
Yeah that's better
Maybe the H is a little off
just a hint
Noice
I think that's good enough
https://gyazo.com/65cd2ea8782484edd5094b4d5dc38d92
by hand
not name, char sprite
updating it, hold on
<@219159380094877696> may I ask how you made that nice character menu name?
Does this name look better?
Oh, I am fucking retarded. I did it the other way. Thank you!
ooo
Nice, finally ?
Weeeeeey
Niiiice
:D:D
https://gyazo.com/c953e772235a8fb7f520f57d441421d9
And fix that to be `local mod = MyMod`
Just, put the whole framework code back in
I thought it was going to be obvious
You decide to edit first `mod` and the entire rest of the code
When I put `local mod = mod --EDIT IF IT ISN'T mod`
No it's not
"But hurr durr I changed it, it's fixed"
Yeah ...
*sigh*
wait what the fuck
Change the first line to `local mod =`
Are you blind m8
```Lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Healthcare", 1)
-- later
local items
do
    local MyMod = mod
```
You've checked log.txt, right?
Dude you didn't change it at all xD
sorry for tagging you kube, my mistake
thank you so much yatboim ?
<@!267112861921181697> hmhmhm
https://hastebin.com/cirituhixu.lua I checked and NONE of my items work
apparently so
all or nothing eh
wow.
omfg you were right
I ain't gonna fix your old shit
testing it
Well give me the real one then
I'm very disappointed there's no ZAWARDO on that timestop mode :/
Old hastebin, that was changed
but yeah, just renamed that layer from Mei to the character's name and bam, works fine
let me try that
:v
so i guess for character loading it's all right or nothing works
you didn't rename the layer in one of the anm2 files (Death Screen.anm2) and since that was missing, your character didn't load properly at all
You guys know what's the DamageCooldown on a standart Isaac flash animation?
Your RegisterMod variable isn't mod x)
RIP
`local MyMod = mod -- !!! CHANGE THIS IF YOUR RegisterMod VARIABLE ISN'T mod !!!`
?
you're gonna be real upset with this news <@219159380094877696>
Well I guess KubeRoot will have to answer
https://hastebin.com/aseyayugez.lua
no stat updates
item not working
That is ?
oh shit, after posting this I apologize for tagging
Still dealing with the issue from the code framework <@126590786945941504> gave me
Hey Ender whaddup
Where you can create pages, edit their content with useful info etc
Modding of Isaac should have a Wiki-type deal
hello
Feel free to share said knowledge by the way
at least then i'll have more knowledge to help others
send it my way then and we'll get it sorted out
i'll just pm it to you
Whoever wants the character thing im doing so you can help me
Actually
Good use of the gravity event
Nice hahaha
i'd have to upload it somewhere then
just send a link
they didn't do a great job
if you can send files
I can send it over here if you want
Time Stop
?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu0ww4rAxC4
because guessing your problem isn't going to get us very far
But at least it's finding that there's supposed to be something
is your mod packed up somewhere?
That's RIP
https://gyazo.com/3de1e49b0d9e02984958930248868a97
still not there
Isaac after an OP run, that is.
Sigh
He's the Isaac of animation through math
Damn yeah he is
Quilez is bae
<@126590786945941504> somebody has good references
could you add lights to things with shaders kuberoot? i'm a little naive when it comes to the render pipeline and what access we have to it
:D
Hahaha Quilez's smooth minimum
The binding of Virtual Boy
GLSL for days yo
Man I'm gonna mess with that
then maybe you simply forgot something
Whaaat you can do a whole shader overwrite !?
nope
or a special character perhaps
does your character have a space in the name?
The layer is the same name as the character
I renamed those too
because the anm2 files look for a layer with the same name as the character
Here's the shitty shader mod
or did you rename stuff
did you change the images only?
Oh, I missed that conversation
or the stats page
it's not loading the player icon
What do you mean by that?
what's wrong with your player menu
That's like the creepypasta version of BoI
Anybody wanna try to beat the binding of downsaac? http://i.imgur.com/VGoumjn.png
sigh
And I guess <@112975821186031616> can you tell you all about it
Well I have one idea, and that would be to use an utility called diff
I have no idea xD
then how would you ever test it
Can't see many alternatives
I hope not
ugh
Did you install it through Steam ? Maybe it actually did more than copy a folder to the mods directory
and it doesnt work
literally everything is the same as that mod
sigh
sin for his robotic majesty
pray to RoboBaby, make sacrifices
Haha alright
it doesn't work at all
I EXACTLY copied the mei mod
with your character
Seriously how can you make the player menu work
<@203215784770535424> yeah, I just overlooked it and after trying a gew things I realized what that I had mistyped that
Well RoboBaby is officialy a satanist
<@172780123504771074> yeah ?
can someone kill me already
http://i.imgur.com/GxnTjM6.png
why would it work
of course it still doesn't work
Sigh
<@203215784770535424> Right, so I decided to take a break, updated some Hip-Hop recordsto my spotify andI come back and realize that my issue was I used a . instead of :
Do the same then xD what can I say
it just. works. in his mopd
I downloaded the mei thing
there isn't one
That's the only sound advice I can give you x)
See what XML files use the images, and replicate their format
how on earth do I do the character thing in the main menu
urgh
character icon in menu wont shop up
<:huttsRIP:248237561988775936>
RIP xD
#hope
No! Why!
please work...
?
No problem, I'll be staying around if you have more questions
I've been trying heh. Right I'm probably skimming right over it. THanks a bunch again!
But you can safely use the docs as a reference
I don't know your code haha
the EntityType?
Right so I'm basically just pulling the stuff I need out of the table, which in this case should be eer
No problem haha
Riiight okay I think this helps out a lot.. 
I feel I need to make a run through the language tutorials again
Kube was suggesting their free book, I'll probs read that up

Wow, thanks for the clear up man ?
Likely, functions that expect an `EntityPlayer` as a parameter will not complain if you feed them a table that has exactly all the key/value pairs they use (instead of many more like a true EntityPlayer would have)
Nothing more
So when in the documentation you see "`Isaac.GetPlayer(integer)` returns an EntityPlayer", it actually means "`Isaac.GetPlayer(integer)` returns a table in which you can safely expect to find the contents described in the `EntityPlayer` field of the doc"
I dont fucking know how the term in english is ffs Bulgarian
I mean
Well it's not a strictly defined language so yes
Calling them names is only a way for the programmer to know what they're dealing with
Also, there are no types in Lua ?
What we do by writing `obj.Bleh` is actually not access the property named "Bleh" of the object (or structure, if you know C) obj, but actually remove the value for which the key is "Bleh" in the table obj
Instead of using a raw table that has no specific type declared?
So I have to specifically convert it to entity?
Mm-hmm
A table has fields that can be defined by anything
I'm fairly new to Lua myself, but I got that much
Tables I gues are something I got confused by a lot in the tutorials
Everything remotely complex is a table
There are no objects, classes or containers in Lua
I am very new to Lua, yeah ><
You must be new to Lua ?
<@203215784770535424>  Well that is really odd because my log demands that it's returning a table instead
<@172780123504771074> it does
it is
Hard to earn anything from there
Game:GetPlayer(integer) returns an EntitPlayer, right?
Yeah, the gaming market is oversaturated, really
a full company by the name of <Void> Logic Entertainment
I want to start a business
If you have questions ask anyway
oh yeah
someone did and i need their help haha
cs is the deal
aw
Also, if you're going to get a job, a game dev degree isn't going to give you a good one
I did not do such a thing
did you make a character?
I what ?
<@203215784770535424> you made a character right
went to
the magestic bearded god
gaben newel
mmh~
You have found **5** item(s).
!items
hell it's what
that's what most programmers go to
Plop
Yeah, CS is probably the best
The skills I learn in those can adapt to gaming like spreading butter on bread
instead of bothering with a gaming degree.
THat's why I am attempting Dual Majoring in Business and Computer Science
well yeah
but yes
mmhmm
not just game design
communication is importiant everywhere, and everywhere in programming too
But that does prove my point in how communication is important in game design
I can't blame him for Sonic Boom despite the fact that he was the director of that project, to be fair development was fine until nintendo suddenly revealed that they had two months to port the game onto gimped shitty hardware
Sonic Xtreme would have been the first, and best 3D sonic game
if Chris Senn had decent fucking communication skills
I mean
pretty much
and CERTAINLY don't fucking tell you the ACTUAL skills you need to successfully COMMUNICATE these ideas over
really
And that's the most importiant part
but they can't tell you for shit why it's important to do so
how to code a move, character or otherwise
They can tell you how to make a level
like, this is my problem with video game design schools and classes
It felt like a game design class if that makes any sense
It just told me "This is super important because this and this" but it never told me why and furthermore
yeah
but well, it depends
still, a video on how to mod isaac won't go in depth on the language itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Y78C-2T1g
this was the video I found which is why my code looks weird
just basic stuff
for reference
Shouldn't take more than 1-2 days if you're dedicated
wlel
yeah, I know
If anything I would recommend doing basic lua tutorials to get started, then come back
Not saying it isn't useful lol
Oh yeah
Galaxy trail had a sonic OC that became Sash Lilac of Freedom Planet, so successful to get a sequel
Even to mod a basic lua knowledge is useful
Hired BY SEGA
And his OWN FULLY FUNDED ORIGINAL SONIC GAME
From shitty sonic ports to literally the best ways to play any classic sonic game
Look at Christian Whitehead and Galaxy Trail
I wanted to do mods because after mods you can move on to make full games I mean
shit fam
like
Damn I am impressed
That's all?
by the way
is that it?
Room start
I specifically worked on that and I could probably cut out a quarter of the code if I didn't do that xD
And it'd automatically update the player if they have the item
You could then later do ```lua
items["Candy"].MoveSpeed = -2```
So if you registered ```lua
items["Candy"] = {
    Damage = 2,
    MoveSpeed = 2
}```
As it automatically evaluates cache if you change the stats of one of the items in the framework
The stat framework would be useful for this
Also, little fun fact
Is it just on room start or at any time?
and if you aren't, it will happen more
It's effected by Luck, if you're lucky it will happen less
like Broken Stopwatch
Yeaah
Oh, you mean, completely at random, out of the blue?
the player
it slows YOU Down
not tear but like
I looked up a tutorial as to how this shit is supposed to work and this was all that was supposed to happen
Well, the simple stat framework lets you add tearflags too
it looks like you're missing a couple of 'end's in your function
that is, the Randomly procking slow effect
candy is a simple stat item but it also adds one wrench in the gear
eehhh
BTW, if you want to do simple stat items, you might be interested in my framework: https://redd.it/5ooq09
But you haven't closed the function or the HasCollectible if
I'd start with learning Lua ¯\_(?)_/¯
I'd start with why the hell were you using a shitty tutorial whatsoever
I have a feeling the tutorial I found was ass.
You telll people, they don't read, but this
*sigh*
```<formatting code>
local CandyMod = RegisterMod("Candy",1)
local Candy = Isaac.GetItemsIdByName("Candy")

function CandyMod:CacheUpdate(player, CacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Candy) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage +2;
    end
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then 
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
    end
    
CandyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, CandyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
Can you show the contents?
yes
Do you have a main.lua?
it's in Resources like it should be
Like, "runtime is terminating in an unusual way" is an error I've only encountered when trying to hack the fuck out of the class system to gain access to a Config instance
....png- the sprite Yeah it is
Are you sure the png file is there and is valid?
none at all
Nope
Do you have any other mods enabled?
ONLY when the mod is in the game so I know that I'm fucking up somewhere
"Runtime was requested to terminate in an unusual way"
erm
sooo
It says "runtime is terminating in an unusual way"
I'll try that but I'm unsure
welll
anyway did you try putting a / before the > on the second line?

Because I need help with <#220581404612886528>
Hey someone good at programming?
either rendering them as text in game or in the log
You can always debug the variables
right
nothing off in the log except a huge amount of ```000000Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 574, Subtype: 0; Pos: 187.562241, 306.028992; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000```
bizzare
I don't see anything wrong with it
I mean, I believe that part of the code is fine
at the start as false
yes
clear is defined outside the function, right?
this is at the start too ```local currentRoomId = game:GetLevel():GetCurrentRoomIndex()```
also, with that code you don't need first visit. Since that would also mean that it won't work if the player bombs out and in of the room
```if room:IsFirstVisit() then
    if room:IsClear() and not clear then
      local    level = game:GetLevel()
      local chance = math.random(1)
      if chance == (1) then
        sSprite:Play("Spawn", 1)
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(fam.Position, 50), Vector(0,0), player)
      end
      clear = true
    end
  end
  if currentRoomId ~= lastRoomId then
    clear = room:IsClear()
    lastRoomId = currentRoomId
  end```
<@124088844181045249> oddly enough it now triggers when first picked up and never again
with the id being the item id
with a specific item on
spawn 5.100.id
how do i spawn an item pedastal with the dev console?
you also check if the player changed rooms
if both are true, that means the room got cleared this tick
and if it is now
Essentially you are checking if the room wasn't empty the last tick
thanks
I'll try it out
```
if currentRoomId ~= lastRoomId then
    lilTrinketBoxClearRoom = Game():GetRoom():IsClear()
    
    lastRoomId = currentRoomId
end

```
and
but should work
Don't know if that's the best way to do it
```
if not lilTrinketBoxClearRoom and Game():GetRoom():IsClear() then --Room got cleared, potentially drop trinket
    if myMod.randomInteger(1, lilTrinketBoxProcChance) == 1 then
        local spawnPosition = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(lilTrinketBoxFamiliarEntity.Position, 0)
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_TRINKET, myMod.randomInteger(1, currentHighestTrinketIdNumber), spawnPosition, Vector(0,0), player)
    end
    lilTrinketBoxClearRoom = true
end
```
something like this
set it to true and spawn the item
and the flag is false
and if the room becomes empty
if you just have a flag that you set to false if the room is not empty
yeah I want to avoid that
also, this will trigger on rooms that are empty
because thats a bad idea
I've removed the first local clear = false
no, IsClear should work just fine
should I search for entities? and if that comes back true then run the rest
yeah poor spelling
sorry a black heart
or black heart
you mean like, sending you a room back, or something?
oh
because it was triggering in the spawn room
essentially at the end of the room I want there to be a chance for the familiar to drop a back room
what is the purpose of this, for example? `level:GetCurrentRoomIndex()`
I'm actually not quite sure what you are trying to do
I'm fairly certain the while do isn't even necessary and can be accomplished by an if then
The animations also don't play but I'll get to that afterwards
its really conveluted
```local function onFamiliarUpdate(_, fam)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  fam:FollowPosition(player.Position)
  sSprite = fam:GetSprite()
  if not (sSprite:IsPlaying("Spawn")) and not (sSprite:IsPlaying("Float")) then
    sSprite:Play("Idle")
  end
  local room = game:GetRoom()
  if math.random(7) == 1 and player:HasCollectible(ItemId.SSKULL) then
    sSprite:Play("Float", 1)
  end
  local clear = false
  if room:IsFirstVisit() then
    if room:IsClear() then
      local    level = game:GetLevel()
      while clear == false and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex()~=84 do
        local chance = math.random(1)
        if chance == (1) then
          sSprite:Play("Spawn", 1)
          clear = true
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(fam.Position, 50), Vector(0,0), player)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end```
Let me see, maybe I can help you
meanwhile here's me trying to get something to trigger at the end of a room
looks fucking great though
Might be a bit much
https://streamable.com/qodtt
Now different colors have different tear effects, based upon their color
or even just addeffects of the item
it'd be annoying but a workaround nonetheless
you could have to game give you an additional item that adds a costume when you pick up the familiar
But I guess Isaac doesn't want to put on his costume when it's a familiar
oh sorry
Everything works just fine
This is just for regular items, and I know how to do that
This is not what I need, but thanks
this guy has good tutorials
try watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPRrtj2mJ8o
I fear I may have to
I don't wanna force AddNullCostume
i do not know how to do that yet
the costume
yeah
ah
whats not working then
but I want a costume for isaac
entities2.xml*
the familiar works just fine
got that
you need an entities.xml also
well it's not applying
familiar
or type="passive"?
do I just use type="familiar" in the xml?
Familiars are just regular collectibles, right? Shouldn't need anything special if that's the case, I imagine.
like, on isaac on pickup
does anyone know if I need to do something specific to apply a costume to a familiar item?
<@112975821186031616> oh yeah i should've realised that
Just throw it outside your loop.
you have to spawn them in the cache eval with a familiars cache
<@193389830690963457> Every time your script runs, you're declaring `clear` as true right before you compare it to being false. It'll never ever be false for that.
and the familiar callbacks will run for it
But you just make an entity with id="3"
idk shit about how do they work with callbacks
Anyone quickly run me through how a familiar works?
wish my sprite guy was onine :c
Well, time to start making sprites/animations for the bats
any reason as to why this doesn't trigger at the end of rooms ```local room = game:GetRoom()
  if math.random(7) == 1 and player:HasCollectible(ItemId.SSKULL) then
    sSprite:Play("Float", 1)
  end
  local clear = true
  if room:IsFirstVisit() then
    if room:IsClear() and clear == false then
    local chance = math.random(1)
      if chance == (1) then
        sSprite:Play("Spawn", 1)
        clear = true
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(fam.Position, 50), Vector(0,0), player)
      end
    end
  end```
was too spooky. so I turned down the spook
it
?
spooky door
can't beat
Well, since I realised you can use `bombs="5"` in the items.xml, I don't really see a need for that thing
true
that's really not convenient haha
Eh, except cache callback wouldn't work if your item doesn't cache anything in the xml
*only reasonable way
i guess keep track of the number of items held and compare it to GetCollectibleNum in the cache callback
Well, the only way I can imagine is checking GetCollectibleNum on either POST_UPDATE or PEFFECT
how do you check for that btw ?
As in, the exact moment the player picks up the item
No, it's a simple stat item framework after all, I don't even check for that in the mod
for when you pickup the item
What kinds of callbacks?
<@116386733905412105> I get this alot also ```[ASSERT] - Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 574, Subtype: 0; Pos: 290.856598, 293.393463; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000[warn] no animation named Head```
does it have callbacks ?
Well, then, just in case anybody's interested, posting a link again: https://redd.it/5ooq09
<@229593818691928067> Thank you

        clear = true
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(fam.Position, 50), Vector(0,0), player)
      end
    end
  end
end```
yes
the variant is 574
which I assume is your follower
why is that though
the entity is type 3
it's detecting an entity teleport
quick question any reason as to why this keeps occuring on mass in my log ```ASSERT] - Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 574, Subtype: 0; Pos: 80.000000, 280.000000; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000```
the loop was 40 frames, copy and paste 20 times it'll play your Appear animation then Idle for 13 seconds then Appear again but who spends 13 seconds on the title screen ?
as a hack
that'll work
```<Animations DefaultAnimation="Idle">
        <Animation Name="Idle" FrameNum="840" Loop="true">
            <RootAnimation>
                <Frame XPosition="0" YPosition="0" XScale="100" YScale="100" Delay="840" Visible="true" RedTint="255" GreenTint="255" BlueTint="255" AlphaTint="255" RedOffset="0" GreenOffset="0" BlueOffset="0" Rotation="0" Interpolated="false"/>
            </RootAnimation>
            <LayerAnimations>
                { frames from Appear }
                { frames from Idle } * 20
            </LayerAnimations>
            <NullAnimations/>
            <Triggers/>
        </Animation>
    </Animations>```
<@249083616901070848>
It popped in my mind that it's an entity colliding with another one
?
yeah I just figured it out
It's an entity attribute
CollisionDamage is the tear's damage
"Appear" does not play.
Wait what's the paramater that determines a tear's damage then? Or is it always taken in proportion to the player's damage?

```
because some enemies spawn others
I've also just realised that for the Item i'm trying to make checking for a dead entity would be obcene
Many ways to do so
ah
yeah you'd have to do a FrameCount check
like keeping track of entities that you have already activated stuff for
so IsDead passes several times, unless you don't do anything about it
i think so
wait
yeah
It's just that the entity isn't removed the next frame
hey are TearDamage, TearScale, TearHeight etc used for the character's tears rather than the ones spawned from the item?
Well, it does
i assume IsDead doesn't work like how I assume
bit scary
<@126590786945941504> this happens now
Elijah first ;D
Well, time to start on characters
np haha
THanks a lot for the help
ayy
?
I managed it
https://gyazo.com/1911797abf3c9119513cc6c347f46323
still need that tear explosion effect?
Ayyo hello
Hi mad!
Alright
<@193389830690963457> Change `Everything.onFamiliarUpdate` to `onFamiliarUpdate`
Back homeeeee
Well, I'm going to skip you the trouble this time
Where the hell did you even get that?
you could change the looping animation to have the Appear animation in the beginning and then duplicate hundreds of time the looping part
There's no `true` in there
What <@171906066051760128>
it doesnt need the true
thats to play a random animation every so often
<@249083616901070848> if you're trying to change the animations for the title menu then right now it's not possible to control which animations play, so if you want to have an appear then something that loops i'm afraid that might not be possible (someone correct me if i'm wrong)
https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
More specifically, the first few chapters on variables :P
I'd refer to Programming in Lua, the book, available online for free
<@126590786945941504> Do you have a document to refer to?
(its 1 for now for testing)
Its a familar that after an enemy is killed it has a chance o drop a black heart
I going to be honest I don'y know what that means
But `onFamiliarUpdate` is only available as an upvalue
Well, you indexed the `Everything` table with `onFamiliarUpdate`
What do you mean?
And where do you put it in the `Everything` table? :P
it referse to this ```local function onFamiliarUpdate(_, fam)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  fam:FollowParent()
  sSprite = fam:GetSprite()
  if not (sSprite:IsPlaying("Spawn")) and not (sSprite:IsPlaying("Float")) then
    sSprite:Play("Idle")
  end
  local room = game:GetRoom()
  if math.random(7) == 1 and player:HasCollectible(ItemId.SSKULL) then
    sSprite:Play("Float", 1)
  end
  if room:IsFirstVisit() then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if (entities[i]:IsDead()) then
        local chance = math.random(1)
        if chance == (1) then
          sSprite:Play("Spawn", 1)
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(fam.Position, 50), Vector(0,0), player)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end```
Well, show the rest of your code :P
yeah i couldn't think of a name
but the callback is fine ```Everything:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE, Everything.onFamiliarUpdate, variant.SKULL)```
Also, did you really call your mod `Everything`?
You passed a `nil` to the `AddCallback`
can anybody help me wih this familiar error: ```[ASSERT] - Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 574, Subtype: 0; Pos: 320.000000, 680.000000; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000[Everything] Error in MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE call: attempt to call a nil value```
I have to spawn the entity laser first though
I think jean has it
ah
that's for entityplayer tho
with the angle inside the parenthesis
you can use FIreBrimstone() also
You just have to detect when the start animation plays and, well, play a looping animation afterwards
Actually
afaik
you can't control how the animations play <@249083616901070848>
`brim = EntityLaser.ShootAngle(1, pos, angle, duration, Vector(0,0), npc)`
so who knows how to make an npc fire a brim?
`titlemenu.anm2`
in code ?
where ?
what
this
<@229593818691928067>
with the offset stuff and such
I have trouble figuring it out properly
So, how does the color class work?
that would be *FUN*
Remove a random collectible item per floor
Whey I love Ultra Hard too :' )
The way I did it is to entirely remove heart pickups from the game, haha
there are plenty of ways you could increase difficulty somehow or another
On a fun side note that is totally irrelevant and Im just interested in knowing - is there a way to increase the difficulty like Purple heart does? ?
That's actually neat, but his has the screenfuck factor due toe more tears

I fought a rainbow once
rainbow color with different tear effects
instead of splitting up light, it splits up tears
The plan is to have it work similar to a light prism
Well, it's not going to just be split shot
great minds think alike
FeelsBadMan
i literally already have an item like that
pretty
Woohoo splitting tears. https://streamable.com/uhfrm
tried passing in 0 instead, caught exception
calls for a ProjectileParams in one of the arguments but throws an error: expected number
yeah definitely broken
Good api strikes again
hmmm apparently they don't work for anybody
<@249083616901070848> what do you mean ?
on EntityNPC
FireProjectiles (Vector Pos, Vector Velocity, ProjectilesMode Mode, ProjectileParams Params)
ProjectileMode?
is there a list of valid ProjectilesMode options
ah thanks ^^
In this mod
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2809/demon-in-a-bottle
I did Scayze
<@229593818691928067> Is there any way to play a "loop animation" after playing "Start Animation"?
ehh. Has anyone successfully used GetData() to save some information to an entity?
Found the communist.
I mean it's not a lie to be fair
Well
https://gyazo.com/fe604b2d50fa0b4865c0525acbcbc693
ask noodle
how old is robo-baby 2.0 anyway
but I also want to be an angel me and you go way back <@216324079504982016>  c;mon now
i wannt to be an angler please I need food
i want to be an angle instead
i want to be an angel
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I want to be an angel the morest
Don't do it. I've never met someone with a devil role I liked.
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be an angel even more than Flipski
we need an "Angle" role since there's no room for angels
?
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
I want to be an angel
i tested RNG but not math.random
well 1533 and 1315 are definitely different sequences.
Math.random() doesn't produce very random numbers, doesn't it use the clock as a seed?
there was a post that said RNG and math.random both had the issue
but math.random() is built in to lua
yeah
are you on windows?
"This is not an optimal world " - <@112975821186031616>
I was able to get random results with math.random()
1533 1315
lol
is that right ?
"If you hug the top right corner before entering the next floor, you always get a library"
wow that's throwbacking. Might even get some speedrun exploitations out of that one lol
go oldschool and use playerposition
or the room decoration seed
just use something arbitrary, like a reference ID :^)
but, y'know
not pretty
some sort of workaround
or something
For now, just use the game frames since launch as a seed when you load in a game
Optimally all useful features should exist on release, but this is not an optimal world.
yeah, it shows that they at least care that they're missing things in the api
I mean, they will, eventually
Well I mean it IS something at least, it's hope all the other issues might get attention
he added a function that should have existed on release? neat
Right, let's hope Tyrone finishes his Spongebob season soon then :^) I mean to be fair he did add ToTear() yesterday so people can;t be too sour at him
or if the limited environment allows os.time() or whatever it is in lua, use that for the seed
wait for an api patch
So what would be the correct way to do  get an optimally random number then?
because good api
but, on windows, that will be the same string of numbers everytime you reload the mod
kk thx
RNG():RandomFloat()
You obviously ask when you're clueless
Mm true, but sometimes you can't reach the solution in a logical way, for example I hadn't realized the Modcallbacks returned a boolean and I couldn't find that mentioned anywhere
how do I use RNG
It depends if your goal is learning or creating something
yes, but you still gain experience by having someone help guide you as well
Well, you do gain some experience in problem solving
I learned that with the invincibility piece of the code, yeah ?
yeah i respect that, but you spending 2+ hours on something that we can help you with in a minute over something obtuse isn't always the right choice
I find it easier to learn it as I'm actually building something, so I'm trying not to ask you guys about every little thing, plus it gets annoying - I mean I gotta put in some work, research, ya know
yeah the cache is kinda odd, make sure to ask questions if you need help with it
Definetly don't know this, don't worry ? I'll be honest I don't know how to use cache or what it's for, so I'm just learning it as I go
(you may already know about this but it is not particularly obvious)
You also need to make sure the cache knows what stat to update
stat changes are gonna need a cache update, and if you want to do it dynamically you have to use player:EvaluateItems()
That's the stuff I'm gonna look into - player stat implementation and connecting visual cues with the item state ?
yeah, that's gonna happen, this is far from done, but it's something at least
It'll be better if I implement the player's stats and teartypes and some visual effect to know if it activates
is there a visual cue for if it's active/when it activates?
cool idea
I was trying to fit it between Infamy and Holy Mantle
ah
There's a chance it wont negate any damage in a room and it's just once
When you enter a room the item you have activates and randomly you negate damage once per that room. After it is negated you will periodically shoot tears as show in the gif until leaving the room
Umm
No when
If so, that's awesome
When a bomb explosion hits you, you make a tear explosion?
achievement*
I'm too proud of this minor achievment, honestly
https://gyazo.com/1911797abf3c9119513cc6c347f46323
There's also the player:GetPlayerType(), which returns the character they're playing, including darkjudas and laz2
I got the effect I needed, I playtested it for a floor or two before dinner and
I think
EntityPlayer:GetName()
there's a PlayerName or something like that right
uh
so my "new character" actually looks like what i want it to.
ClearCostumes() but i cant seem to figure out the "specific players/characters" part.
I'm trying to figure out how to remove costumes on specific players/characters.
It's a shame that neither docs nor resources mention `shader`, not even once
from time to time
so you have to take it off
ehh idk
But you're drowning when you have it on
Bowlshaped.
While it's on you get distortion and increased damage
like goldfish aquarium.
You can put it on, you can put it off
i was thinking of that goldfish sort of thing.
0 charge
My idea would be an active item tbh
Or water tears,
...water tears
But how would the aquarium work? You shoot piranhas. (pirahnas? Piranas? I don't know.)
Actually, that's genious
Yeah, thats a good idea.
Like in the cartoons :P
Also, you could have an aquarium on your head
And a way to switch them on from Lua
water eyes
that would be perfect if you'd get something related with eyes and water...
Also guys, I made an alternative shader, this one really feels like water distortion https://streamable.com/095gf
I'm trying to make a "delirium" mod.
Yep
For now atleast.
...Then low damage?
so you either have to work around or wait
fire rate cache doesn't work properly currently though
make it a multiplier
maybe have a really slow fire rate.
or low damage
Good idea,
...and has continuum.
slow firing rate?
which is op.
By the way, can you suggest me how to balance my character? It literally shoots 5 tears.
I just want an easy way for people to find someone's mod from their discord
Oh.
Most don't have a problem with people talking about their mods
Nah, myself
?
You mean Maddogs1`
It's fine
Not talking about that
Its a private mod.
Hey, i'm just sending a picture of it...
What would be the best way to shamelessely advertise your mod on this channel without writing it in chat?
Its ze deleeriummmmmm as a charact0r
TBH daurt is the best GoT character
daurt
Working on a mod, you can guess who this is.
You just play the animation on the player
Depends

None of that is hard to make in Lua prolly
Can't wait
I have Joe making sprites for me too ^_^
I took the day off tomorrow to get it working
None of it is the easy part haha
I want like evolving animations where he sprouts bat wings and flies up slightly then starts spewing then from his cape tho
I think the active item is the easy part
But that's gonna be tough
Killing everything in a storm of bats
That transforms him into a massive vampire who throws bats everywhere
I also plan on a 24 charge active item
damn, sounds really interesting
He also slowly loses health, so he has to feast to stay alive
Is there any sort of /whois on discord?
<:isaac_surprised:245063314873253888>
If he lets go of fire the bats come back to him and heal him for amounts of enemies killed
He'll summon bats and they home erratically into enemies, number of bats based on tear rate
For starters he has an awesome cape etc
I did not mean it in a backhanded compliment kind of way either, really
Do you guys have links to your mods?
My vampire mod will hopefully be as follows:
tbh I feel I've spent more time trying to get modding than actually playing afterbirth+ ._.
Yeah, I like to make stuff seem complex when it's not that much
I mean, they look really good!
XD
You do seem to think your items through very carefully
<@269950308606672898> I hope it's at least as pretty
Still basically noone looks into it, heh
If you think the paint mod is impressive, wait till you see my vampire 8D
I hope to release a big update for my mod today. Bring the item count to like over 20
<@121460786655657985> Yeah, I can see that. At least you are getting into the modding early, a lot of possibilities still left open
?
<@219159380094877696>  if I get stuck in a rut you can, I'm nearly there I have to make the parabolla effect and it'll be done pretty much
In two hours
You'll just have to wait until I get home
And <@172780123504771074> I can send you the code used to make it work if you want
<@124088844181045249>  Yeah, I suppose, but it is the first thing I'm making so it's mostly just getting the hang of it
Dang kube :v
<@219159380094877696> I don't think there's a way to control shaders from Lua
Magic IT fingers
?
Hahaha
Dang, flip found it before me
<@229593818691928067> It hasn't gone far enough to produce the first item , we have the time to live
I feel like people keep getting the same ideas
it looks so cool !
THAT IS THE EXACT EFFECT IM TRYING TO GET MINUS THE PAINTED PART EFF

`a clown set of items`
has modding gone too far ?

Wtf
Nope same one
Yep, I', trying to make a clown set of items. Might make something like that, like a water-squirting flower item or smth
https://gfycat.com/GorgeousJitteryIlladopsis
Here we are
The new ones are even better
wow that's pretty
Lemme checj
And as for the tears splitting up on the way down, it sound really awesome. Like a bombardement of tears
Oh right I saw that gif yesterday ?
Wait that's the old one
Yeah, <@219159380094877696> bombs looks sick
http://gfycat.com/GorgeousJitteryIlladopsis
<@249083616901070848> it probably wouldn't play it if you added a new animation but you could add something at the beginning of whatever animation it plays
Let me grab the gif
Hexanix, I had a nice effect on my paint bombs doing the same thing
Wow, that sounds neat
I'm gonna make him have the ability to cycle between potions to throw by using his active ?
Right, I'll scale down the effect a bit so that it doesn't look like a college partygoer after too many drinks. 
I'm thinking it would be fun if the shots split into smaller ones at some point in their fall
Mind sending me that snippet of code in a PM flip?
Cheers to Flip for helping me with it
ooh
That's the flight pattern my mad scientist character will throw his potions
np
The fountain
that is the result
https://streamable.com/if2g3
Oh! Thanks a lot I'll look into this, it'll be useful ^^
```
local customtear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, player.Position, Vector(5,0), player):ToTear()
customtear.Height = -5
customtear.FallingSpeed = -50
customtear.FallingAcceleration = 2
```
The default is -23 something I think, height is weird. Why is it negative? Just how it's coded?
So <@126590786945941504>, when are you turning these into pill effects like retro vision? ;D
maddogs should have the code
tear height has to be negative
but yeah, you pretty much set the tear falling and acceleration variables to high values
Don't quite remember how I did it
Depends on how you are going to do it. Player value for the tearFallingSpeed is apparently inverted
I see then, I'll try it out, thanks.
Also is it something I'm missing or does TearHeight just have a very slight effect on the way tears look in game?
But I haven't done it myself
Though from what I've heard one of these has to be negative
So it flies up fast and starts falling down quickly
You just set tear Velocity and Acceleration to big values
Nope, but I think I know how to do it
<@126590786945941504>  Was it you that showed that parabolla tear movement a bit ago?
Would it be possible to add `Appear` animation to `titlemenu.anm2`?
Hello!

Honestly kube's effect looks more like heat if anything
You need :GetHearts() for that

Cos player's .hitpoints is how much damage he takes in the current floor
That confused me at first

Entity.Health?

this always prints false
Might take tomorrow off work to do some moddin
```lua
function mimicdoormod:my_mimic_update(mimic)
    Isaac.DebugString(old_mimic == mimic and "true" or "false")

In advance: I'm sorry
It's time to make a shitty shader mod
Y'all know what
is different each frame
the variable passed in as my npc
so in MC_NPC_UPDATE
Where the game just goes in realtime, but you get a bonus as long as you press buttons in rhytm
right! PLAYER_CREEP
You could make it patapon style
For my paint item I used PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN and adjusted the sprite color
Jean, there's different creep effects, some that don't hurt the player, but I dunno how to extend the duration
And I mean perfectly right
Another would be that getting the beat right spawned brimstone lasers from you, alternating between diagonally and horizontally and vertically
does anyone know how to change creep duration and make it not hurt the player ?
That was one of my ideas
tears fired within a frame of the beat hit have bonus stats?
I know how I'd make it work, I just dunno how I want the character to function for the rhythm guy
Also would a mad scientist character who throws potions that make creep work well?
then go from there.
then translate that in to frames
you'll need the bpm of whatever song you're trying to sync up to
I want it to kinda be like Crypt of the NecroDancer in the way that getting the beat right rewards you
But I have one left who will be a rhythm character and I dunno how to make it work
A demon that summons pentagrams in front of him
I have a vampire who attacks with a bat army that move on your command
How would be the best way to style a rhythm based character
Try getting the child of the effect I guess ¯\_(?)_/¯
I wonder if that poof is an effect that you could remove :D
Gah that damn Mei mod took my idea for a character
hm
I still got the poof of smoke
that just made it not play its idle animation
```lua
    ent:ClearEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_APPEAR)```
uh
or rather removing the flag
I'd try giving it the flag
alright, how about: how to remove the puff of smoke on spawn?
nvm I just gave it an outrageously high collisionmass
anybody know how to make an entity not move around when it gets hit?
had to make my entity's id within the set of ids currently used as enemies
alright got it to work
but my custom entity doesn't ever spawn
because I can goto it
ok so the room gets loaded in
Feel free
well I'll find out.
Can't really tell you haha
presumably.
and include those exports in my mod's content/ or resources/ folder
then I just export the room editor results
well
But that's probably not a good idea, if you want to distribute your mod
You'll probably have to append it to the game files yeah
Oh wait if it's the room editor then I don't know
Make sure to use the same tags too
No, just create in your `content` folder a file with the same name as the XML file you want to append things to, and then fill it with your content
I gotta append my custom stuff to the default xml files and tell the room editor to use those right?
so to get the room editor to use my custom stuff
No problem
Cool cool I got my code to work. Thanks for helping me out with understanding how it worked.
o**no**
I am many automata.
yeah
automata is plural
Automata is the plural
It's automat**on** apparently
Except it is
Probably not exactly
That's the name
(And shut up, I forgot the actual name)
Welp
It's just a finite-state automata
As an arachnid, I am unoffended.
No, it doesn't think
It lives, it writes, it thinks !
"it" xD
See, it agreed with me \o/
If you're gonna be like that
Well I mean that also works with isaac-ng and the various SOs
Yeh.
We need a #linux channel where alzarath and the likes can repeat over and over "Ha, file extensions" "Ha, GUIs", "Ha, installers"
lol
Ha, file extensions.
Also, I didn't say any of that except for the "expose" button part
Well run one on isaac-ng.exe and the various DLLs and you'll see what I saw
Maybe the amazing disassembly that proves Nicalis is satan itself trying to steal our money with a DLC that's literally an "expose" button :P
Sure it's not writable, but it's readable
It even had symbols exported, what more do you want
Especially things disassembled into C, that's no big deal
mhm
I've disassembled shit before
The config class exists, you can access it via ItemConfig.Config.__class, the functions exist but we can't get an instance
I know how to read a disassembly alright
Does anyone know how to use Color:SetTint() properly?
And I know that from experience, not some dude who came here with a disassembly and said something that you believed because he had a disassembly, because sorry, that's wha tyou look like
Or the broken Config namespace
Few things like the dozen classes that are referenced in the doc but aren't exposed
Some things, few things and they're slowly patching everything up
But some things are still very wrong
Yes, sure, "A dude"
Don't get me wrong, it's still great that they did
ah, apparently the binaries aren't in packed; they're just in resources/rooms
They hit a big "expose" button and that's it
A dude came here with the disassembly to confirm
The majority tbh
But a lot of stuff works
It sure looks like it
They missed key stuff
They missed stuff
Yes it is
No, it's not
<@126590786945941504> the "without checking anything" part is what they did though
How do you think that'd work, that they'd just magically have everything you could ever possibly want already predicted and coded?
there isn't a packed -> rooms
<@203215784770535424> Yes, of course, let's expose every single function and behavior available in C++ to Lua without checking anything, what could go wrong?
I went to the packed folder
importing the binaries told me it was missing .stb files
Because that told you what you have to do
Import Binaries.
yes
Did you read what it said when you first opened it?
how do I get the pre-existing rooms in the room editor?
Which it does
You shouldn't have to create anything more if the code for it already exists
That includes all those gibs
Or just create an animation
Oh, isn't it just the gibs from entities2.xml?
And there's nothing you can do about it except rewrite the entire code for aaaaall the various triggers to spew blood in different fashions
There will be no blood spewing out, no nothing and it'll look ugly
Well just see by yourself, try to play Monstro's "Death" animation through an entity that isn't Monstro
What do you mean by "triggers do nothing"?
Ofc it's a doable, you can iterate over available sprites and make callbacks yourself
Yeah but the triggers do nothing anymore !
Just swap out the entity and sprite and bam, you're using it for different entities
Dude, there's no writing more code, it's just not doable
And you can reuse the same code
So, "I'm not used to this system and I can't be arsed to write more code so it sucks"
Because of that, you can't reuse the same code for the same events in different entities
Instead of manually catching triggers after they've happened
adept?
what
A callback function is much more adapted for this
That's pretty sucky
And what's the problem?
They're quite handy
And yeah that's my point
I used them
Yes, I know
What I call "triggers" are defined in the ANM2 format
You can just get if they were triggered yet AFAIK
You can't "define" triggers in Lua, can you?
that was my issue <@112975821186031616>
The same trigger events you define in ANM2 files
Trigger events are defined on a by-Sprite basis, by an unexposed API
Well, there's a file called `bossportraits.xml`, but the id of 13 doesn't match Lust.
What do you mean by that?
"forces you to locally define trigger events"
And no it's not good. It plays animation but forces you to locally define trigger events so they're not usable anywhere else
So, the class is awful because you can't graps its basics?
"Didn't care to try"
Didn't care to try
Also either GetFrame() or SetFrame() is broken
Yes it is
anybody know what the "portrait" value in entities2.xml means?
Lust has a portrait value of 13 but I can't find a lust portrait in the unpacked resources
No it's not
The Sprite class is nice
The Sprite class
What's horrible?
It's horrible but there's nothing else ;_;
Is there something better?
Dude no
I need to learn to use Sprite.
And then when you pick which one, that item actually spawns in the middle
It renders text and an image for all 4 items
The idea being you walk into a room
Yeah
Probably more elegant too
That too
^
Then again, they could always just despawn the items and then spawn them in with the poll.
That's a way
Delete it upon acquiring it
I don't assume there's any way to prevent a player from picking up an item.
Yeah, definitely
Seems like it'd be hard to enforce something like that with the API as it is.
As well as choosing which item at mom to pick up, which floor to go to etc
And chat can choose which you get
But it only adds items, nothing more
The plan is that twitch chat will be rendered in-game, and upon entering rooms with items you get multiple choices
That's Polling of Isaac
That sounds pretty rad.
No mod exists to do this currently
There's one that added 4 items to a room and you had to manually do a poll
Isn't there a mod that interacts with it somehow out there? Could look into that.
The ability for chat to decide what items you take, what floor you go to etc
Damn son
Implementing twitch chat into BoI
What's the project anyways?
I'm interested in this project haha
I have been, just might as well ask
Nothing easy, I'm sure.
You'll have to look at the Twitch API.
I don't know about that, sorry
*twitchchat
Or a program that does it already
You would think that yes, your function then takes a player as an argument.
Anyone know how to output twitch that to a file easily?
I thought that was obvious by the argument named `player` in your code.
<@94052069345861632> yes exactly
And <@126590786945941504> that's what `player:HasCollectible` is for
RIP
Somebody kill me
*sigh*
Oh right because ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE takes a player as an argument right?
Can't you also pass the item ID to the PEFFECT to only trigger if a player has the item or smth?
Your function will be called multiple times with the appropriate player being passed as a parameter every time
Lust has a portrait value of 13 but I can't find a lust portrait in the unpacked resources
anybody know what the "portrait" value in entities2.xml means?
He means how he accomodates multiple players.
Yeah I get that.
`function MyMod:Pewpew(player)`
Dude it's in your parameters hahaha
Iterate through them.
But since doing local player = Isaac.getPlayer(0) is bad, how'd you get the player entity?
Right okay. That is good to know.
And by that I mean holding the arrow key, at least with normal tears I guess
ACTIONTRIGGER_SHOOTING is active every tick the player is firing
ah okay. My Lua isnt that great. Still getting a hang of it.
Also, just so you know
Lua has & for bitwise AND and `and` for logic `and`
Not boolean
Oh.
That's bitwise AND
Why not just `and`?
Yes
Only one &?
And remove that horrible `local player =` line
What you want is `if player:GetLastActionTriggers() & ActionTriggers.ACTIONTRIGGER_SHOOTING ~= 0 then`
Back in my days you had to alloc every single bit you wanted to use!
Well screw you too gramps ?
'ave ya ever heard of proper coding practices?
Kids these days
*grumble grumble*
Doesn't help that all of the tutorials I've glanced have used it.
Yeah I can see that ?
<@94052069345861632> don't mind him, he's a grumpy old man in advance
I want to find the first person who started doing it and murder them for spreading the misconception
I'm sorry, but I've lost track of how many times I've seen it
*urgh*
Dude come on
Just fuck you
Also, fuck you for the `player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`
Fucking RIP
Also, the player bit hahaha
Also, `()` are not mandatory for ifs whiles and fors in Lua
Oh I see
Additionally, you have an unclosed ( on the first if
That you have to check with &
It returns a bitwise integer
Welp
Returns an integer.
No
Doesn't `player:GetLastActionTriggers` return a table ?
*sigh*
```lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("BreakfastBurrito", 1)
local breakfastBurrito = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Breakfast Burrito")
--local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)


  
function MyMod:Pewpew(player)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if (player:HasCollectible(breakfastBurrito) then
    if (player:GetLastActionTriggers() == ActionTriggers.ACTIONTRIGGER_SHOOTING) then
        player:AddBlueFlies(3,Vector(0,0), target);
    end
  end
end
 
  

MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE, MyMod.Pewpew)
```
Hey buys. I have this code that I can't get to work. Doesn't seem like the code ever gets into the if player:GetLastActionTriggers() statement
Oh okay
You just weren't registering them as sent
They were being sent
But they left it in for Jacob and Esau balancing or something
By that I meant, my messages weren't being sent haha
Suposedly it was originally a glitch
Alright there we go
yeah
Discord is dying halp
Test
and two players can pick up both items
in the alt path all item rooms have a choice right ?
Did they ?
What ? No they didn't
No Antibirth I have issues with item distribution, I never saw these double item rooms
double item rooms
No idea what Antibirth did. What'd they do?
wouldn't he just have to do what Antibirth did ?
Yeah ...
The most likely way they'd change it would be to make the enemies more bullet-spongey, and bullet-sponges are rarely fun.
It would make coop truly hard, whereas with coop babies you can mostly mess around and if you die, oh well, the other player just needs to grab some health and that's it
For a game supposedly challenging, it's not that big of a deal IMO
Multiple full-sized players would make balancing a nightmare.
It makes sense to me. Only one Isaac, and the babies get only a fraction of Isaac's health.
Dude x)
Tbh true
Oh, right, for some reason I assumed the first would be the current option
The limited gimmick being the coop babies thing
Which one are you talking about?
"limited gimmick"
what
Hm, let me think
"Do you want something that's genuinely fun to play or a limited gimmick for multiplayer"
He also asked if people would want the charge bar and dice room descriptions as everyone assumed he wouldn't.
As weird players will randomly get bonuses
Ed asking stupid questions
It'll completely go to fucking shit if there's multiple players with items
If you do Isaac.GetPlayer
Also
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/820758574628380673
That gives the opposite impression of him adding multiplayer.
That's not **the** tweet yet
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/820760141041500160
Just thought you meant something more urgent like it discretely breaking things or something.
Oh, well I think I saw those.
Ehhlemmefindit
Antibirth-style multiplayer might be a thing and the game theoretically supports multiple players
Show me the tweets, Kube.
Didn't you see the tweets
Nononono
how is that not practical ?
No
Oh, well I can see the value in adding it for a collectible. But not an active item.
It's not funny
is an example
I'm gonna be so mad
If I see you using `Isaac.GetPlayer` somewhere where you should be getting/passing the player
if all you need from your passive is a one time thing
dude
this is very contained though
Not even, 'cuz you'd have all that extra clode for creating the callback, then you'd have to effectively create the entire function anyways, but in a less readable way.
no, fuck you for that `Isaac.GetPlayer`
ew
```items["Mysterious fabric"] = {
    CanFly = true,
    TearFlags = 3,
    Damage = 1,
    TearColor = Color(0.9,0.9,1,0.6,0,0,0),
    callback = function()
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        player:AddSoulHearts(1)
    end
}```
It'd save you, what, one line of code?
Good point
redundant
And adding it for use would be, like
That's right yeah
Its use seems mostly for passive items.
This is meant for simple stat items
In the context of a framework that makes adding objects easier, it makes sense
The thing is
Opinions are divided
that'd be a good idea i think
That doesn't seem very valuable, to be honest.
In your `items` table
<@126590786945941504> suggestion : add a callback value to your framework that is basically a function that is registered as an MC_USE_ITEM callback
Hype
alright time to make my first custom enemy
kthxbye
hicheckoutmylatestuploadhttps://redd.it/5ooq09
hi!
Well, it is a spriting tool
As in *a sprite*.
lolwat
Oh, *aseprite*. Thought that was a mis-spelling.
hahah
Yech. Encrypt that junk.
Especially with how the license is and considering I used the free option
Don't worry, it takes up 15MB and I can't legally distribute it :P
Don't worry, I won't use 'em ?
And not sure which files are from which
I have aseprite in my animation editor directory
There's one problem
erm
Rars work on Linux, silly.
I could pack it as a rar just to fuck with you <3
i had to install AB+ on windows to get the animation editor but then it runs on Wine with no config
Eh, throw 'em all in there just in case.
Do you want all of them or just the relevant and useful ones? :P
Only the ones that work on it. It doesn't send me Windows files.
Do you not get the tools on linux?
...whut
Would you send me your tools folder?
Well I mean that probably goes without saying.
But "I wish I wasn't lazy"
Then it's not "I wish I had access"
Bah. Lazy.
Supposedly it runs fine in wine
I mean
lol
I wish I had access to the animation editor. T T
You can interpolate scale, position and rotation too
Rescaling is in the animation editor
Is that done frame-by-frame or is there some sort of thing that allows that in the animation editor?
It looks epic enough as it is
i forgot to make it flap its wings lol
It's perfect
Also does it drop them or just give them?
Omg

I have to leave now, if someone finds out what the fuck is wrong, then please message me. School is a dick. Bye.
Try it ¯\_(?)_/¯
NO IDEA IM BORED AND CANT GER TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF JAW PAIN
Does that work for other pickups, <@126590786945941504>?
Why are you doing that?
I like how I'm just still in the chat just posting randomly and awkwardly just being here
BTW, TIL `bombs="5"` works in items.xml
I mean I've never done it so who knows.
Probably not the problem, though. Probably.
k
Oi, don't assign an id.
<passive description="Heroes never die!" gfx="Healthcare.png" id="929" name="Healthcare" />
My best guess is you don't actually have an item by the name of 'Healthcare' in your items.xml?
help meh please I'm running out of time
A huge mess
I wanna be a big mess
I not want to
Stop being a mess.
I'm a mess
mine are a mess.
Bleh, tabs.
I have to leave in seven minutes, fyi
https://hastebin.com/aseyayugez.lua
It'd help.
the brimstone breaking is a random error i have no clue why it happened and isn't happening consistently, the triangle brimstone has been reverted to outward brimstone
what do you  mena? should I post a hastebin?
Admittedly I'm not sure if that'd make a difference in lua.
Did you put it *before* you added the `The Bread` table?
You were only supposed to copy the parts after the comments in the `local items` stuff, fyi.
to MyMod = MyMod
Yes, I changed the mod variable
You're using Kube's framework? Did you add his code to the mod?
Excuse me, but I got an error on line 7 saying that there was an unexepected arugement in callback, got nil, but line seven is a variable.
Oh huh why is it breaking? Figured it out?
In Loli's mod.
Wait brimstone is broken?
for me it was a triangle of straight brimstones that didn't connect well
iTs A fEaTuRe
Just write it off as a feature.
It doesn't go back into the little ball.
The brimstone, when shot, kind of just stays shot.
but the API is limiting my ability to fix some things how I want to
i'm fixing an issue right now that i didn't realize would be an issue with ipecac...
what was broken about brimstone?
I enjoyed it too, hard to use if you didn't get a good run.
the brimstone was broken though ?
you did a really good job, i love that character ?
``items["The Bread"] = {
    Damage = +0.5
    MoveSpeed = +0.5
    }
``
hm, my cache updates do not seem to be working. Am I doing it correctly?
i am
oh hey <@!135254843567767552> are you the one you made Mei ?
That's much different from C#? Seems like standard behavior.
I hope custom achievements and completion marks will be available soon.
See ya guys
Thanks a lot for the help <@135254843567767552> ! I've been looking for a scope explanation in lua, but I think I pretty much get it. Locals were a lot different on c# but then again lua isnt much like c# at all. Right I'll make the fixes once I get home, thanks a whole bunch!
still bytesize?
how does this one's numbers work?
That seems to be the one people are using.
https://hastebin.com/onovihirov.hs ?
Robo baby please
there should be an updateder one
Speaking of which, how do I add red health with the cache
though that looks like the one that was create before they fixed it
ok...
they are bitwise, so 1,2,4,8,16,32, bit shifting
1<<3 is not 3
Aight/
Maybe you should throw it on the Binding of Isaac wiki if you can verify it. They could use the contributions.
or is that not it? 3 seems to be homing and not spectral and piercing...
https://hastebin.com/xaqudunuba.hs
I found it! It would be nice if someone could pin it, if someone wants to use it in the future.
Ill check the reddit. Thanks for your time.
nope, there's a file floating around somewhere though
ok, thanks. I can find these on the documentation?
3 would be penetration and spectral
I know tearflags has to do with tear effects
if that makes no sense, you should read this <http://lua-users.org/wiki/ScopeTutorial>
oh! sorry to bother you one last time, but what does TearFlags = 3 mean?
if you want to use it everywhere else in your code, you should put `local tear_1` up at the top so that it doesn't just get defined on _G
thx, you too
good. thank you, have a good rest of the day / night
not really...there are a few problems with where it is. being where it is it belongs in the surrounding if statement's scope, so what you're actually doing with `tear_1 = blah` later on is setting tear_1 on the global table, which will make it accessible to the rest of your code...and everyone elses code
yes
one last thing, just to clarify before I waste time, item pools are working, yes?
¯\_(?)_/¯
ok, I figured. thanks for the framework, it is going to help a lot.
No, the framework gets the ID for you
do we still need to getitemidbyname at the top?
<@!135254843567767552>  why take out the definition of tear_1 from the first if (the frame()==1)?  Doesn't local cover the :onDamage() function aswell?
thank you, just reassuring myself.
Right below the callbacks
<@!267112861921181697> Yes, after the `end`
it changes back to default otherwise
hey kube, just making sure, but for your framework, we want to edit the thing at the end, after the callbacks, right
Why play the sprite every tick?
Something like that, but
```for _,tear in pairs(ai.projectiles) do
    local d = tear:GetData()
    d.fallingVelocity = d.fallingVelocity + d.fallingAcceleration
    d.z = d.z - d.fallingVelocity
    tear.SpriteOffset = Vector(0, -d.z)
    tear:GetSprite():Play("RegularTear8", true)
end```
I don't have code, but that's just how you'd do it
And every frame you set velocity = velocity + acceleration
Every frame you set height = height + velocity
At start you set it to TearHeight
But you basically update it every frame
On Entity
but i can't change the range
I'm not sure if it's PositionOffset
i have a hack of updating the sprite offset yeah
Then you want to change offsets
no just an Entity
the shotspeed can be changed by Velocity
And, just to be sure, that entity has no built-in behavior for, well, falling down/range?
well yeah
And by "projectile" tear you mean just an Entity?
Kube do you know if those params Height, FallingSpeed etc. can be emulated on a "projectile" tear ? "ToTear" doesn't work on them
interesting
ahhh that's apparently what range is
yeah i meant expected air time, whoops
Also, if you want actual distance, you'll also need ShotSpeed
No, but 1. I think I've seen it on the wiki and 2. It's a simple square function dammit
kube, do you have some helper function to turn TearHeight, TearFallingSpeed and TearFallingAcceleration into a distance?
If you're looking for a monstro's lung like effect where you want to spawn multiple tears at the same time you'll need another for loop to loop over that spawn section of code
`local tear_1` in that first if statement need to be brought out of that if statement
`local tear_1Stats` isn't necessary since the attributes of the tear are accessed using `local tear_1`
Because it's a square equation
The most meaningful is the acceleration
tear_1Stats.FallingSpeed? YOu mean tear_1.FallingSpeed?
have you set a tear's tear height before? the default height is -23.75 and doesn't move the tear in a very meaningful way
"TearHeight is a poorly designed variable" Now what the f does that mean?
You need `Game():GetNumPlayers()-1` I think
There were a few issues here and there
```lua
    for playerIndex=0,Game():GetNumPlayers() do  -- applies to all the players
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(playerIndex)
        
        if balloonPopped == true and Game():GetFrameCount() % 1 == 0 then
            -- Create the entity and cast it to a tear
            tear_1 = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 1, player.Position, Vector(10,10), player):ToTear()
            tear_1.Velocity = Vector(math.random()-0.5,math.random()-0.5) * 8 -- A random velocity
            tear_1.Height = -math.random(20,30) -- TearHeight is a poorly designed variable
            tear_1.Scale = math.random() + 0.6
            tear_1.FallingSpeed = tear_1Stats.FallingSpeed * (math.random() * 0.5 + 0.75)
        end
    end
```
okay so
Now on reddit
https://redd.it/5ooq09
Thanks, sorry for not clearing that up, I should add descriptions when sharing the code ?
Thn
okay now that i understand i can help you out here
ah i see
I want to be able to change the spawned tear stats so that I can achieve that effect  of spreading the shots
an dthen negate a random hit once per room, upon which I want tears to be shot (spread actually, simmiliar to a less directed monstro's lung) from isaac after certain periods (hence the frame%50==0)
the item is supposed to be picked up
No, no I don't think I've made it clear in the code
but since you're creating a pickup, you probably don't mean those stats
if you mean the proper stats of the tear like Height, Damage, etc, you need to cast that entity you got from Isaac.Spawn into a Tear first `tear_1:ToTear()` and then access them
as for stats, the data for that entity it on the entity itself, so whatever you're looking for can be accessed with `tear_1.Position` or `tear_1.SpriteScale` for example
```local tear_1 = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, WaterBalloon.COLLECTIBLE_WATER_BALLOON, Vector(320,300), Vector(0,0), nil)```
I guess tear_1 should have been the entity itself and then the tear_1Stats should be the data for that entity, but I have a sneaking suspicion I still don't understand how that works
no idea, what are they supposed to be
with the risk of making someone angry Id like to ask for some help. I want to learn how tearspawning works and after some thought I came to this: https://hastebin.com/wekovuwome.lua  What values should  tear_1 and tear_1Stats take?
hot damn
MaxFireDelay doesn't work because nicalis plz fix
<@227262590697340928>
```lua
items["Mysterious fabric"] = {
    CanFly = true,
    TearFlags = 3,
    Damage = 1,
    TearColor = Color(0.9,0.9,1,0.6,0,0,0),
}

items["Pegasus Boots"] = {
    MoveSpeed = 2,
    TearFlags = 8,
    ShotSpeed = 1,
    Damage = -1,
    TearColor = Color(0.3, 1, 0.4, 1, 0, 50, 0)
}

items["Pegasus Boots"].Damage = -2```
This framework lets you easily define stat-changing items as well as change their stats during runtime
I see yeah
That one has a callback for errors, so it's more try/catch type
There's also xpcall
Makes sense
Oh it just returns a boolean
I assume it's no try/catch-type thing like in OO languages
How does the "catching" take place ?
pcall calls a function and catches any errors
Well
I'm not familiar with Lua
What's pcall ?
Some userdata errors on you if you try to index stuff from it
And unless I'm retarded
Because why not abuse pcall?
Because if not, I figured out ```lua
    local isColor
    do
        local function colorTest(c)
            local _
            _ = (c.R and c.G and c.B and c.A and c.RO and c.__mul) or error()
        end

        isColor = function(c)
            return type(c)=="userdata" and pcall(colorTest, c)
        end
    end```
Also is there a built-in way to check for colors?
Yeah I see
`c1*c2` is equivalent to `c1=c1*c2; return c1`
Is what you mean by `c1*c2` editing c1
Basically
...?
It's in-place multiplication ?
So I figured out I can use Lerp to clone colors ```lua
    local cwhite = Color(1,1,1,1,0,0,0)
    local function cloneColor(c)
        return Color.Lerp(c, cwhite, 0)
    end```
Wow that's awful
It's retarded
You'd get different results every time
If you were to repeatedly multiply `c1*c2`, without externally changing `c1` or `c2`
What ?
So `c1*c2` actually edits `c1`
The __mul metamethod is self-modifying
Colors have a fucked up thing
BTW, fun fact
Because I didn't make them and they'd take up a shitload of space in the code
So why not throw in the TearFlags enum too
I know, but it still needs your framework is what I mean
This itself defines all stat modifiers
I thought it was missing something
```lua
items["Mysterious fabric"] = {
    CanFly = true,
    TearFlags = 3,
    Damage = 1,
    TearColor = Color(0.9,0.9,1,0.6,0,0,0),
}

items["Pegasus Boots"] = {
    MoveSpeed = 2,
    TearFlags = 8,
    ShotSpeed = 1,
    Damage = -1,
    TearColor = Color(0.3, 1, 0.4, 1, 0, 50, 0)
}```
Well yeah haha
Well
What do you mean ?
Of course with my framework at the top
The above code snippet along with the items.xml is all you need to get the items working
Heh I don't agree
But fun fact
No point not hardcoding them if it's just example items
Just. y'know
I'm using those, actually
Yeah I know, they have been gathered by the community though
From what I know, those are missing from enums.lua
You might've missed it, but
Even better : use enum values for TearFlags haha
Yep, slowing works too
Both items together give you green semi-transparent high shot-speed spectral piercing shots for sure
```lua
items["Mysterious fabric"] = {
    CanFly = true,
    TearFlags = 3,
    Damage = 1,
    TearColor = Color(0.9,0.9,1,0.6,0,0,0),
}

items["Pegasus Boots"] = {
    MoveSpeed = 2,
    TearFlags = 8,
    ShotSpeed = 1,
    Damage = -1,
    TearColor = Color(0.3, 1, 0.4, 1, 0, 50, 0)
}```
The framework appears to be working fine
So
Yes
I assume k is the ID of the current player ?
Also hi
That's nice
`for k, v in players() do` iterates over all players according to game:GetNumPlayers()
BTW, in case somebody finds this useful, ```lua
    local function __players(n, i)
        i=i+1
        if i<n then
            return i, game:GetPlayer(i)
        end
    end

    local function players()
        return __players, game:GetNumPlayers(), -1
    end

    for k, v in players() do
        log(v:GetName())
    end```
renrnernmmnshhhnnr
mshnerr
looked*
even*
nvm I think I'm not ven going to pretend I looke hard enough to find it
How should I return an EntityTear's type? 
The EntityType parameter isn't inherited fro mEntity according to the documentation
well shit
oh fuck
I'm also gonna go to bed, good luck on all your modding ventures
Anyways: the experiment continues tomorrow. Good night, everyone.
Considering the transient nature of it, that might work.
I am going to start with that in mind, cause it's a lot less work -- though it all depends on how much control I can have over the Effect's animation :V
gtg
Save them to a table and iterate over that table instead of all entities
You could just, y'know
erm
So: I am slowly becoming an expert at familiars. Maybe next I will make an Orbital...? XD
It appears, does its thing, then disappears.
In short: I am making a familiar that is actually a Crack the Sky beam. :V
The challenge here is simple: *there are no effect callbacks*, so if I wanted to have, say, three simultaneous beams behaving independently, keeping track of them would be a pain in the butt... EXCEPT. My previous item can *do that already*.
That depends on how I implement it, but yeah.
potentially
and even tickrate
Yup.
and you can probably set the damage too
nice
Anyways: making my own beam by breaking down the CTS anim means I can make a *longer lasting beam*. Potentially *as long as I want it to be*. ;D
and they don't stop coming
and they don't stop coming
upon entering the next floor, it comes back
of that floor
is to defeat the boss
HAHAHAH, doooooon't tempt me is way too easy XD
and by ayeverybody i mean good night everyone, its late as fuck lol
and the only way to get it off temporarily
and the beam permanently chasing you
starting off a hard mode run
you know what would make for a really awesome challenge
oh
lol
Precisely. And I tried the Hush beam too but, guess what? Even if you spawn it from Isaac, it still chases isaac XD
ayeverybody
so like a Hush beam?
So, it's a single Crack the Sky beam that actually *moves*.
that sounds really neat
ah
What I'm working on is something that can be described as an "Orbital Cannon trying to aim at the enemies from Space but it's actually random"
then maybe reserve it to 4 beams at once, but they're slightly closer to isaac?
it's just inconsistent
it has really high damage
fair
mm
Yep.
then it would be too good
what if Crack the Sky did a circle of beams around Isaac instead of randomly placed beams
i mean with the current limitations it might be the _only_ idea
Main reason: Crack the sky beam has a *set duration*.
MMMH. I am thinking that maybe, MAYBE, retooling the Crack the Sky Effect into my own effect might not just be a *great* idea, but the *best* idea.
and without the useless stat ups
like purity but more controlled
neat
so it's like a damage vs fire rate mode switching item
that sounds neat
And using that turns it back into the red pill
Which gives you a tears up
Then you can use it and it turns into a blue pill
While holding the red pill, you get a damage up
It's an active item
You pick up the red pill
That's like
Also, I'm thinking about an active item
a tiny book is stil la book
PIL **is** a book
oh it's like somewhat of a tiny book ok
ok i'll just shut up and read it
:-I
"one sitting"
how long does this take to read in one sitting
o k
i'm not gonna put effort in if you won't
at _least_ skim it please
you should probably read the manual
i cri
oh
no
is that how it's done
ok so
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

  function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
   local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
  
  function MyMod:FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole(player, cacheFlag)
   local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")
   if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole)
  
  function MyMod:FuckMyAssWithATwentyFootPole(player, cacheFlag)
    local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 10;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.FuckMyAssWithATwentyFootPole)
```
this way you can easily see what is controlled by the control flow statement, as well as where it ends
everything inside of some contrl flow statement should be indented past it, and the ending part should have the same indentation as what it's ending
_fondly remembers all the times that autoindenting has helped find missing ends. Last week._
i don't actually correctly know how to indent so i'll just give my best shot at it
Or use a tool that autoindents. They are hella useful.
indenting is very useful for _exactly_ the problem you're having
fine gimme a sec
if you understand then why not fix you're indenting? I wouldn't be telling you to do it if i didn't think it would be useful
You have a Function, that contains an if that contains an if. So, one end to tail the inner if, another end for the other if, and a final end for the function
you guys are really getting on my ass about indentation and i understand but calm
that's why reading the manual also helps
^
That's why indentation helps.
do i need three ends
i mean*
that's not what i'm talking about i mena
if they are not the same you're doing it wrong
count your ifs and functions, and count your ends
every if and function statement needs to end somewhere
because i bet i fucking do
but do i need three ends
no
I lost my FeelsGoodMan with a gun, does anyone else have one?
~~~end jokes are gr8 aren't they~~~
let's see if making a duplicate CTS works. BRB testing.
do i need three ends at the end of the ending statement so i can end the function?
wait
Ah, the follies of youth.
no lube needed ( ?° ?? ?°)
dont enable this behavior
okay let me get the lube
WITH A TEN FOOT POLE
no
ASS
IN THE AS
ME
fUCK
no equals
```LUA
function = Mooknkoyo.Life()

end
```
XD
because you are ___STILL___ missing an end
the `end`s should be the same indentation as the things they are ending
fine i'll fix it when i get around to it
nnnnnnnnnnn
your indentation is still garbage
ok so here's the one thing function i'm having problems with
```LUA
function MyMod:FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole(player, cacheFlag)
   local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")
   if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
    end
  end
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole)
```
(also look at my beautiful callback and function name)
weird
I can't even remember what I was trying to do with Config. But, yeah, it's this Black Box that *looks* like it contains *very useful stuff*, but it's all locked away.
til to always be scared of kube, he's a cranky old man ( ?° ?? ?°)
You can access the classes under ItemConfig tho
Which is needed for GetCollectibles(), for example
As in, you can't get an instance
But not accessible
as well as classes
um, config is under namespaces
Literally Unmoddable :V
Heheh. Yeah. I was fuming in my head last week about that.
Like ***WHERE THE HELL DO WE GET A `CONFIG` INSTANCE?***
The only API problem I'm pissed about right now is Config
Honestly
~~ok so i'm trying to make this one function but this one end that is needed but seems to be just dandy keeps kicking my ass~~
Yeah, let's go back to complaining about the API's many shortcomings. Stupid Crack Beam Damage.
lua's pretty easy compared to other languages
or should i just look up tutorials and then figure out how to make original content
probably, if you want to mod enough
would it be worth trying to learn Lua from scratch after having tried to learn Java in the past to a certain degree
<@269562360295849985> See, I personally would say >95% of the people here can't code well, but that's just me being an asshole
also we're getting a bit off-topic again
wow robobaby
yo robo-baby is brutal
Success as in, learning how to Code Well.
***RTFM***
Want to learn programming?
either spend 4 hours trying to figure something out, or ask someone and have them tell you within a minute that you forgot a semicolon
So, want to learn programming? ASK.
Afraid of asking? ASK ANWAY.

There is literally **nothing to lose**.
Yeah, depends on how you define success
yeah, especially in programming
cranky old men scare me ( ?° ?? ?°)
In my experience in Education, the students who succeed the most are the ones who ask the most questions when they don't know something.
i actualyl don't know
But just tell me not to help you and I'll keep quiet
or woman
exactly
Well I am an asshole
kube is just a cranky old man
kube scares me
life is a meme
just kube
= ___=
not you
we're just memers
do you really think we're hostile?
my boyfriend keeps telling me to ask for help but i'm actually scared to ask because i'm going to get murdered by kube probably
Alright, I have tested all possible variables! 

CONCLUSION: I will end up programming my own effect, 'cause nothing else works the way it's supposed to XD
i _have_ a pc
Get a fooken PC
so rip
ehg
i wish i could have gotten linux working as a dual boot for my laptop, but i just couldn't get it to work, and VMWare bluescreens me
Though for a long while I didn't go beyond messing around with bash and forgetting most of it
With my brother being a linux fanatic and whatnot
I got quite a head start
>since high school
*eeeeeeh*
as a computer science major
and rn i am in my final college semester
i've only been programming since high school, and only particularly seriously since i started college
huh
(( so was i. ))
*I was dead back then*
*oh okay good point chalenged*
heh
First time I did any coding was in Logo, when I was but a wee lad, IN THE 80S.
We're mostly quite experienced programmers here
*i should be afraid*
I feel like including VB, ASP and prolog there are just cheating
I've been programming regularly for... 15 years now?
don't be afraid ;A;
((and you should be perfect at coding within the first few days of you trying it /s))
i'm starting to be afraid to ask for help tbh
It's a matter of practice, honestly. You don't get good at coding from one day to the next.
(( because code is capable of feeling emotions, everyone knows that /s ))
thanks for the info anatole
<@227262590697340928> : Short answer: Yes.
script*
actually, i think i first kinda learned lua from ComperCraft, the minecraft mod
*does my code hate me due to the fact that i suck at coding*
i started with c++, then a class required java so i kinda learned that, then a class required python so i kinda learned that, then something i worked on used javascript so i kinda learned that, then DS modding required lua so i kinda learned that
Let's see...

I started with Java. Then C++. Then Visual Basic. Then C#. Then ASP, Python, Matlab, Prolog, Haskell.
Those were two questions
shock
None ?
Oh, what other 7-8 languages and how many of them are HTML? <3
cause it's seeming that way
have you considered that the API is too limited for this?
Nope, still doing 2.0
COULD BE.
(( of course thats cheating, i already program in like 7-8 different languages so learning lua came almost naturally ))
maybe try entity:Update() after changing the collision damage? ( i don't actually know what update() does)
You know how I learned Lua?

I sat down, and started typing until *something* came out that worked.
https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
that's my passive aggressive way of saying read up on the language
It's not MinRadius
Nor MaxRadius
Mass? Nope. Obviously.

CollisionDamage = 20.0

BUT, it does 2.0 damage, even if I increase that value to, say, 100.
i like helping people with things, but at some point i feel like i should be putting in less effort than the person i'm helping
hhhhhhhh
should read that
yeah i probably
oh
Dude, if you don't have a clue about Lua, how about you read a book about Lua, like Programming in Lua, that's available for free online on the official website?
is that a form of candy?
there's an apple with a razor blade in it
(also i put ends after the local because i thought that's what you meant because let me speak from mook to english: "I don't want you to write code for me I want you to write out where the error is at, so i can learn to find it in a different piece of code. Mostly because I'm a fucking idiot and I've never used lua before this, thank you for all the help you can give me, and goodbye.")
Caramel apples aren't in the game, are they?
huh
or a glob perhaps
And by "item idea", I don't mean "give me random stats"
make it a ball of molassis
Unless somebody wants to sprite that
+speed - shot speed
And something a shitty spriter like me can sprite
Also, I need an item idea for an, uh, simple stat item
if everything needs an end, do ends end with ends? What about those ends? when does it end?
Well how do you end each letter in an end without having unended end letters in the end ends?
are you THE apocalypse? :O
and everybody
i will end everything
everything needs ends
now that i think about it
cause it seems like you think local needs an end
if that's the issue
local doesn't need an end
but ok lemme check
so if that doesn't help you than i cannot help you
i'm pretty sure i did
Or the if, or the while, or the for, but in this case the function
and i don't have another way to reword it
He said that the end is supposed to only be after all the code that's supposed to be included in the function
no not neccessarily
mook please scroll up
Like seriously
i think
could you also translate from english to lua?
"Guys, I don't know what I'm doing, can't you just write the code for me?"
you didn't say anything the second time
I'll translate from mook to english for you
Nonono, you see
was i unclear the second time as well?
*i want you to fuck me jerry, fuck me, and by fuck i mean help*
GOOD point
sure
Aren't we all those challenged guys on this blessed day
i'm getting afterbirth+ soon anyway
make up your mind
am i _that_ chalenged guy or _some_ chalenged guy
hueh
Well, either it was for ab+ or some chalenged guy put it up there
rip
i probably read the shit wrong there
rebirth doesn't have proper mod support
the workshop is for ab+
uwot
well i found a mod there that was for rebirth lol
True. But, if I want to learn how things work in this thing, I gotta tinker with it until I cannot tinker with it no more. :V
only ab+
there shouldn't be rebirth mods on the workshop
help anatole and then help me
what about on rebirth
<@269562360295849985> Alternatively just recreate the beam yourself
Don't press tab again because that disables them
subscribe to them, then in isaac go to mods, press tab, and then they're enabled
does anyone know how to make steam workshop mods work?
So, back to my goddamn crack the sky problem: entities.xml lists ``collisionDamage=0``. There are no other clues as to what can possibly change the value of the damage, except it's of course a Float. Expect more info from me about this subject soon.
i am a baby
That doesn't mean you should bully them
***THE ENTIRE TEAM IS BABIES***
__DONT BULLY THEM KUBE THEY'RE JUST A BABBY__
I've got to find my Lua package in my sublime and just add those bitwise operators
hm
JESUS
the way you open the file doesn't matter lol
gOOD POINT SHOOSH
**OPEN THE FILE IN THE DAMN EDITOR**
isn't your mod saved in a file?
i retract my statement
or, y'know
okay nevermind
copy it down
i could just
actually
what
what
Though from what I remember it doesn't have bitwise operators from 5.3
but that means i have to recode the entire mod kube
it's pretty good
yeah, that's what i use
And I think the standard Lua package is good enough
Just use Sublime Text with The Subliming of Isaac
It can often do more bad than good
does zerobrane studio autoindent
Unless you mean another tab being added after you press enter
Also, autoindentation is, like
don't end a function before you have the code that you want to be inside the function
It's funny how that chalenged guy is telling that other person not to slap ends everywhere
also i don't remember what you said
Protip: If you use any decent text editor, you will likely find a function that autoindents, <@227262590697340928>
you were
yes
i told you the issue didn't i? was i unclear?
</KubeRoot>
*can we get back on topic to me being fucking terrible at indenting and ending ourselves*
I know how to come back after being banned
On one server
I've been permabanned at least 4 times in GMod
pff
you don't come back after being banned
Does that mean that I start with an item when I get banned and come back?
I got eden's blessing

wait really
<@227262590697340928> `Game::AddPixelation()`
Speaking of i'm totally gonna watch the latest nlss vod
oh also once i get dmg up and speed down i'm gonna have to find out how to make a retro vision effect
Oh you right
So it has no spun
Which is in rebirth
Maybe you got used to Antibirth
He's been saying it all along in afterbirth
And it's CollisionDamage, which doesn't actually change the effect's damage :V
shrug
he's only been saying it since ab+
Effect
I have no clue
There's `Entity.ContactDamage`
What type of entity is a crack the sky laser?
He has been taking experimental treatment since AB, because that's when spun came out and it counted towards it...? Or did I miss something?
But
did they fix the items not counting towards it?
what
To get back on topic: Is it possible to change the Damage of an effect, say, the Crack The Sky laser?
erm
lmao
Nah if you'd been actually watching NL lately he's been like "no man now that AB+ is out you gotta take Experimental Treatment for that spun"
i still need that danke help
you're right. To the <#207235517236903937> channel :^)
we're getting off topic
Get a spun role
oh my good point
Get 3 syringes from robo-baby
I've actually got an astonishbing number of good items
Why aren't there transformations on this server
wait
*At least it counts for spun*
this is bullshit
hah
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
...Still not a won run
You have found **13** item(s).
!items
You have found **8** item(s).

        if cannotRunBecauseQuota() then

!items
And then I discovered I could just
So I had to do the pixel loops in a hacky way
I learned them in python for a discord bot :p
I came from ranger cameras in E2
I've learned the magic of coroutines back when writing a trace camera in SF in GMod
Basically, coroutines allow you to *yield* the current execution and return to it later
what a pure soul
lol
and i've only started a few days ago
i have no experience in lua besides this
I'd never looked into it
Oh, there are coroutines in lua?
there we go

i have like no experience in lua besides this and some don't starve stuff
Do you know what coroutines do?
one sec
huh?
so
...what?
dang, a hard lock
```lua
function KubeRoot:Life()
    while true do
        coroutine.yield()

so mook, you only want to end a function after all the code the function should contain
I'll just
gg no re
gg it's over

Ending my life.

i am the embodiment of the word stupid
I'm not sure how long has this been going for, but we gotta **end** this at some point
because i will learn nothing new about how stupid i am
I'd rather end my life here
please do tell me how stupid i am
no, I'd end up shouting at mook if this keeps going
it appears they've found it
i'll just let kuberoot do it
It's in 3 places at least

ok shitlord tell me where i should indent properly please so i can find the fuccin error
ERR was not found and i actually laughed
you could just scroll to the bottom of the log
but it said
and i saw it as i was searching it
i searched ERR
and the last time i did
and i keep searching ERR
ye i do most of the time
literally everytime
also everytime something doesn't work the way you think it should ,check the log
also make sure to indent properly or people will bully you
yessirree
so never be afraid to make mistakes, and admit that you made mistakes, just remember to learn from each one
just remember that programming is difficult to pick up and at first you will have a lot of issues that have simple solutions, but as you get more experience you'll know how to avoid those issues. Coding is all learning from mistakes
;-;
o
html5 is static, it's not a real coding language
so not a full course or anything
in multimedia
which i'm only just learning
this is my first time coding besides html5
not at all tbh
Have you used any other languages before, mook?
But no seriously, every time you open an `if`, `while`, `for` or a separate `do` you need an `end`
ayyy lotr
he's just meming
one end after each if
And one **END** to rule them all
oke doke
Five ends for the dwarves
Two ends after an `if`
One end after every `function`
anyways how many ends do i need after each function
i mean a little
wow u gise r bulys
Don't forget to check for nils in your code! ```lua
if Mooknkoyo == nil then
    --always runs
else
    --actual code
end```
sHUUUT
script*
*HE DOESN'T EVEN CODE*
MY BOYFRIEND GOT IT AND HE'S THE ONE SPRITING
WHY DIDN'T I GET THAT
YOU BASTARD
oH SHIT
:^)
did i end you properly
oke doke
only one
oh
```lua
function Mooknkoyo()

end
```
how many ends do i need to put after each function
eeeeeeeend me
this isn't python
"my problem was that i put spaces" just doesn't work in insignificant-whitespace languages
i'm trying to sound smart shoosh
*what*
so the function didn't have an end
yeah true but my real problem was
was that i put spaces inbetween the function and if
it really makes it way easier to find these kinds of issues
stop whining about my indentation shoosh
he does still have fucked up indentation though
Sorry
The first function doesn't end
Wait nvm
or
Mook just has fucked up indentation
There are enough ends
*sigh*
wait so
you need an `end` statement to end a function, just like how you use one to end an if
i mean i have ends almost everywhere i have no clue what you're saying
*cough cough*
you need an end to end a function

post ur code again
all the time

might help you find it if you fix your indenting
neat

cough
gonna check the log
tfw the item still doesn't work <:isaac:257394072933761026>
sounding :^)
nice
that's gonna hurt
FuckMyUrethraWithATenFootPole
i'll probably move to
whelp
oh i'm making a fan made expansion
(don't actually cause it'll be hard to keep track of callbacks if you make too many)
YES
OH GOD
just keep adding ten for every callback
FuckMyAssWithATwentyFootPole
one of my functions and now callbacks is going to be:
Oh this'll be fucking beautiful.
`MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole)`
wait so i have to call the callback FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole?
Just make sure you're passing in the same function you're making into the AddModCallback function.
yeh
and they'll fucking laugh
i'm actually going to do that so if anyone looks through the code it'll just be there
oh my god
you could call it MyMod:FuckMyAssWithATenFootPole() if you wanted
literally doesn't matter
you define the function name
okay so another small question how do i know what to rename functions as and what to rename callbacks as?
good point???
huh
isn't everything a form of fetish really, though :^)
sure whatevs
oh
it's a something
wait so it's a form of fetish or???
too bad
:^)
also don't google unbirth
just a mod
(also are you working on a fan made expansion? the name unbirth kind of makes it seem like it)
oh ok

ok then i'm confused
oh
no, leave that part
so the MyMod part should be changed, correct?
i, for example, use the item name followed by the type of callback
whatever you want that makes sense to you
wait what should i call the functions
oh
For example
Almost. You'll want each function to have a different name, and then add more AddCallbacks
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
  
function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
    end
  end
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
  
function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
  
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 10;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
So like this?
i'm just being stupid once more
okay good point
you're only using the one mod
wouldn't i also have to register the mod as well though?
(or 3 in your case)
oh
you don't. You define 2 different functions
but i thought you couldn't define one function inside another function though.
they should each be in their own function using the evaluate_cache callback
the same callback though, right?
you should probably make each item have its own callback
i dunno i'm just basing it off of what i'm told and from watching tutorials, and i'm still learning as i'm going along so i honestly don't know, though cricket's collar works
how come grill is the only item to be defined outside of the function?
`items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/">
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
 <passive cache="damage speed" name="Cricket's Collar" description="Le Mao" gfx="cricketscollar.png" />
 <passive cahce="damage speed" name="Broken VHS" description="It's broken..." gfx="brokenvhs.png" />
</items>`
show me your items.xml
no damage up speed down
textures work
also mooknkoyo you need to tell us _what_ the issue is
i'm so confused
all rng is just pseudo-randomness anyway
... the not-so-random rng
what
seed it with os.time
@ me if you fix it thanks
i'm gonna activate the mod and spawn it in 'n stuff in a sec so i can check the log
here's all my code
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)

    local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;

MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
sorry for not being here when i needed help
ok so
time to wait until it gets patched
well so much for making my item that relies on true randomness
What a good api
Sick, even RNG:Next() is still producing the same number even after restarting the game and starting a new run
I just put a RNG():RandomFloat() at the top of my mod and set it to show me, reloaded the mod, and then restarted isaac. It's still that number
Oh my god they're right
Also, what about values after that? Because I can call rng:Next() once to just flush the cached value if it's because of that
so that makes no sense (and isn't the case on Linux it doesn't seem, which is why I can't test it)
Because RNG by default uses the run's seed
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5olp2c/psa_mathrandom_and_rng_will_always_give_you_the/ can someone verify using RNG() without setting your own seed gives the same first value every time you start the game?
post it
Same here.
can someone help me figure out a problem?
...if it is even possible
i think i should make a mod like that
i always liked drawing on the minimap in isaac 3ds
What a relief
bye
so your not gonna see more for a while as I come up with a hundred or some items and mechanics.
I think instead of just running straight into the coding I really need to think from the design aspect first
figured
It's for anything that you want to trigger when the game updates.
the function
PostUpdate is for trinkets too right
is there any way to create custom gridentities
Read the documentation.
preferably one that does not shoot, there does not seem ot be an orbital section
Question: Is there a nice example damaging orbital in steam workshop yet?
<@219159380094877696>  Nice overwatch reference you have there
<@269950308606672898>
is character editor out for ab+
Cool!
Ah i see
MaxDistance cuts the brimstone short like Azazel, the only thing i'm not 100% on is changing the appearance of the laser
you can use FireBrimstone to easily fire a brimstone in any direction, you can limit it to when you fire using a variable or two, you can set the brimstones position to anywhere or parent it to a halo entity that follows your every move, it's easy to get the exact direction the player is firing, so it sounds like your idea is very possible
I'm down to get started on it, i just wanted to make sure it was possible.
Would it be?
seems pretty easy
basically i want to make a halo that hovers over your head and you fire from it as opposed to firing from your eyes, along with making it fire in one of 8 directions.
So. I want to make an item(and possibly a character that starts with it) that changes your tears to a brimstone-esque beam, with a limited range like azazel, and fires in either one of 8 directions or a full 360.
may as well just ask it and see if someone will bite
what's the idea?
Could i ask a question to anyone expiernced in modding? I had an idea i really want to try but i'm not sure if the API will allow it.
cya ?
for now I'm off
Hi!
due to not being able to make them
sadly I've had to scrap about 5 so far
cheers haha
you've got some neat ideas bangin around in there
oh nice
http://gfycat.com/FlawlessArcticIbex
this one stops fatal damage and ascends you
An example of another item:
very cool
Those are two of the 14 items in the pack haha
http://gfycat.com/HarmoniousFragrantGoldeneye
http://gfycat.com/FirmDetailedBarb
http://gfycat.com/SleepyShadyCowbird
http://gfycat.com/WelltodoBaggyGuanaco
i'll get some gifs
it also does it to bombs with a certain item
up to you, if you release it and want to later add things, you should make sure the people getting it know that. But if you think it's fine then go for it
that's pretty cool for an aesthetic mod actually
ye
it just randomizes your tear colour every shot?
should I? :c
it's got.... 14 items so far
I might release this mod tomorrow
Tech 2 is fun - if you don't like the colour you got, just let go and press again xD
shrug
which is even weirder
tech works fine though
weird
only the first laser gets colored
if i give myself brimstone and then 2 mutant spiders
also weirdly enough with my paint item
yeahh...
I was thinking about that at the beginning but realized it would be such a pain in the ass it wasn't worth it for me
have fun
blegh
getting network information async just
That's a bitch of a problem right there
but have no idea where to start...
The output is less pretty now, but it's better done
I wanna get started on the twitch chat integration
naisu
So go give the new one a download
But no, yeah, for anyone who's actually using Modrequire (i think... <@229593818691928067> , you said you were) I updated it and fixed some of the problems
nice!
My paint item works with brimstone and tech now :D:D
but it works better I do believe
i'm not sure if this is worse or better code
updated
https://ptpb.pw/R3Ay.py/py
meaning it flashed rainbow colours ?
I forgot to add ```and entities[i].FrameCount == 0``` to it
LOL
splat colour is probably...for blood? creep? i'm not sure
dang
well, it's not entities[i].SplatColor
you can colour the laser sure, the splash is a child of the laser so you can get to that as well
is that SplatColor?
but not the splash effect? ?
Well, I can colour the laser right
tech as well
i believe brimstone is properly damage flagged as laser
same with tech
or somethin else
is a brimstone laser in ENTITY_LASER or ENTITY_TEAR?
also, GetData isn't a valid function for entities returned by EntityRef, so trying to give all tear spawned entities custom data won't work either
so sorry, you're f'd in that situation
but at least in the case of tech x, the source is just a null entity
in the case of brimstone and such if the source is the player then whatever, no big deal
unfortunately...that doesn't work for things like brimstone and tech where the source is the player
but then it could be a laser or brimstone
Guess I'd have to do a modcallback for damaged entities, and then check if the source is player
you do get the source of the damage, but it's an EntityRef. that EntityRef DOES contain a .Entity attribute which gives you the Entity which can be used to see if it's got the player as a parent
more like a lottle more
that's a little more complicated unfortunately
*'s tears
Also how do I check whether or not an enemy died due to the player
seems right to me
```Lua
entities[i].Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER
```
it just needs certain wording
no wait
yep though
I tried that, nope :/
i think if a player fires it the player will be the tear's Parent
How do I check whether or not a tear is spawned by the player
if you've extracted your resources that is
just go to your resources folder and look at challenges.xml, it's actually documented relatively well
I haven't worked with challenges yet
oh good, maybe you can teach him them then
challenges are just a simple xml file though
then the lua is more helpful probably
Ok, I don't really need the "How to start modding" guide, because i'm already working on another mod for AB
in fact there's a whole section of tutorials on this subreddit
the second link is about lua
Alright, i'll take a look at it.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/40bmlz/want_to_prepare_for_afterbirth_heres_a_list_of/
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/2n7pmk/psa_how_to_start_modding/
one sec
Ok then.
like a basic passive item that changes your damage
so I would suggest you start with something simple
ok.
Nope.
have you ever programmed before?
ah
The problem is, I have no idea, how I make a mod with LUA. :/
I don't know about challenges though
they just gave us access to curses right?
I don't know how to make a challenge.
uh
Could someone help me? I want to make a new challenge (or curse or whatever), but i'm really confused about AB+ modding.
Actually, I really should keep items and characters etc seperate
kill me!
Anyways, time to try and make a character!
Master Spriter over here
I took the placenta item, recoloured it gold and added a shitty dollar sign
you should see my black market sprite
what a shitty sprite
Waow
I'll have to see if Matre can help me if he gets on.
Cya.
I'm gonna be off for tonight tho, cy'all
Gonna be like spectral tears and tears up or something
ahhh
No, **the** fabric :>
Starmap? :p
I've got my first shitty sprite done http://i.imgur.com/AVDfHN7.png
I just need to come up with a few items to test it on
Holy shit that will make everything so easy.
So you'd just do like ```lua
items["Broken VHS"] = {
    damage = 10,
    speed = -1
}``` if you use it
Oh shit, sweet.
Also, <@227262590697340928>, sorry, I can't be arsed to help you with that now, but you might be happy that I'll probably make a simple stat item framework tomorrow
I said that to transit
Mook that was @  me
Oh, that method means I don't have to programmatically determine load order, either
Eeeeeh I don't under stand what you mean by `returns [scriptname] = {scriptfunc()}`. Help me understand please.
That's a good point, thanks. Didn't think of that
Fair
Well, you never know if they don't do `Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Damage = 1000` :P
changes the actual overhead of different parts of the file
it's not "technically" correct
and just directly return them
Why not just run all of the scriptfuncs required at the beginning and save the tables returned
And then unpack that
Like the first time you run it, do `returns[scriptname] = {scriptfunc()}`
that could've been weird
sorry, i was just fundamentally misunderstanding require
ok
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  
    local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
    end
  end
  
    local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
  
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 10;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
Yes, just make `require` return the same stuff
No, just upload your whole code
but i shouldn't make sure every require returns a different table, though, you're saying?
Wait I'm missing the top of the function? So do I need to add another function above
```LUA
local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
```
Because of metatables
Also you can't really reliably do that in Lua
Otherwise those would just be editable
You'd have to go over all subtables and replace those too
I said that if you were going to make sure every `require` returns a different table
i didn't understand that
what did you mean by caching return tables then?
thanks
my b
no yeah, you're right
You should also probably be getting brokenVhs_item outside of the callback
You're missing the top of the function
```LUA
    local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
  
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 10;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
      end
    end
  end
  
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
Actually here's the full broken vhs thing if you want it.
yep, prints `eh`
not mutability in the same file
that was my misunderstanding
fair i should just test it i guess
It should, I can test right now
that's what i'm talking about
?
ye
so if I did
```lua
x=require('emptytable')
require('otherscript')
print(x.test)
```
otherscript
```lua
require('emptytable').test = "eh"
```
it would print "eh"
You do get `player` elsewhere in the code, right?
nope
Are you doing that in EVALUATE_CACHE?
dumb*
i'm done
that didn't work
ok
Okay so am I not able to do
```LUA
player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
```
I've been literally repeating the same thing over and over for the last 10 minutes
This is standard Lua `require` behavior
dude
i didn't know that was the case across scripts
And this prints `true` when ran
I just posted this
```lua
require("emptytable").asdf = true
print(require("emptytable").asdf)```
I just
dude
see, I don't know lua well, my b
Yes.
You can'd make it immutable if you don't account for subtables
oh, it is?
And even better
`require` DOES make it mutable
yes?
But that's standard `require` behavior
so it needs to be separate instances
then have it be mutable by two different scripts that required it
you don't want it to fakerequire something
Tested with Lua 5.1
since it's only going to be added once with my require replacement
The code I gave you is actual Lua behavior
I feel like we're misunderstanding each other
`require` caches the result exactly as it was returned by the subscript
And that's the standard behavior
Scripts are supposed to be able to edit stuff in the library
You want them to return the same thing
Dude
if they both return the same library
yes??
that's what you want to be able to return a copy so scripts don't interfere with each other
exactly, right?
Prints `true`
```lua
require("emptytable").asdf = true
print(require("emptytable").asdf)```
oh
i get what you're saying
you're right
wait
like i said, i don't know lua well
go for it
Like at this point I'm just going to try it myself
What even!?!?
Why table.unpack?
what
I'll go ahead and try
i checked it with table.unpack(require('testing')) unless that's wrong
yeah
Have you tried running that?
unless i'm dumb
it doesn't seem so?
Because that's standard behavior
AFAIK it will
See if the return gets modified
And test it with `require`
Just make a Lua script `return {}`
if someone does i want to be able to handle it
Unless something changed or I got really confused
Doesn't matter
Why would you modify tables that are returned by scripts
Like hold on
ok apparently i am dumb
wait really
No
bye!
yes???
not the original
you want a copy of the original to be modified
will fix this tommorow
ok
say you get a module table back and modify it internally
Or what do you mean even?
am i dumb?
The standard `require` returns the same stuff every time the same thing is required
so if multiple scripts require it it doesn't have to run the whole thing again?
But why?
the module
A copy of what?
ok, i broke my head
to make a copy for different requires?
Why {table.unpack(table)}
am i stupid
What
have it return a copy if necessary, otherwise don't
I would probably also want to detect if that was necessary i think
{table.unpack(table)} would do it, yes?
like it's actually possible to sanely do that with this method
that's one of the things that would make this work better actually
yeah i know :p
Especially if a few files require the same thing
It's not hard to code, but it's easy to overlook
If you really want to imitate require, you have to cache return values from the script
Also small note
especially once i determine load order
it solves a couple of problems
Also kube i think i am gonna do what you recommended with overwriting require
i'm off to bed. Thanks for the help (It still doesnt work but I'll look at it tomorrow)
No, that'd still be too much hardcoding
hmm
So the pseudocode would be something like
I don't like ifs, I wonder how do I get rid of that
That way you end up with just one if for the dot>0 check
Then for collision point you just take that vector and, well, you do vector(max(x,y), max(x,y)) I guess
Then you take those and see which one has smaller length
If it's >0 then it's relevant here
Check the dot product of the beam direction and that vector
Split each one into vectors as X and Y
If you get top-left and bottom-right as coords relative to the player
So, in theory
hm
[sic]
"your gay"
Like it'd just work here, somewhere
I really feel like...
I'm still wondering if I could apply the dot product in here somehow
what do i put as the message
I'm ordering a cake for myself cos I'm greedy
it's more the easiest for a person how i was doing it tho i think
That's how I always was with math sorta but the easiest way mathematically seemed like what i was doing
"analytical methodology" would probably include at least pen and paper
I've never heard somebody describe analytical methodology as a flow.
It's probably a bit easier if you're slightly tripping out from sleep deprivation
You can split the beam into components, you can think about what it'd look like if you rotated the whole thing 45 degrees
+
Imagine the beam hitting the wall, think about what stuff goes where
what
Go with the flow
You just gotta, ya know
y'see
i'll put it that way
i don't know good math
i guess
fair enough
Ain't even vector math here
i don't know vector math so shrug
sad
So you can get the distance to the collision point relative to a wall based on 2x^2 basically
and tearFlag method don't work
Also, since you're firing at 45 degree angles, then for calculating the collision point with the wall, X=Y
wait a sec
What does it return?
yes
And GetEndPoint doesn't work?
variant 5
EntityLaser.ShootAngle
yes
Wait, is that even EntityLaser?
oh true
look, this is what i am doing
https://streamable.com/sms5k
There's also `Room:GetLaserTarget (Vector Pos, Vector Dir)`
Apparently doesn't work right?
EntityLaser has an endpoint vector
Well
Oh, you need to find the intersection of the brim direction with the wall
Wait what are you doing?
yeah
he can science it.
it's just math
but blegh
Could whip up some code i guess
Yeah?
oh
and that's where it'll hit the wall
Subtract isaac's position from that wall, and add/subtract it from isaac's position in both of the two directions
so if firing right, check top value and right value and bottom and right
figure out which wall is closest on each side, with the fire direction
pass the edges
yes
get fire direction, Room:GetTopLeftPosition and Room:GetBottomRightPosition
To get 45 degree intersections
and, erm. let's think
Do you mean pass through the edges of the screen?
ok
for the second
I'd guess give it spectral qualities
how can i spawn something at the end of my brim if i don't know how long is it and it's 45 degree rotated, or how i can make brim pass trough walls?
np mate
Thanks Transit
i will ask something
cuz there is a lot of people
so
unless i'm misremembering functions
should do it
```lua
function Mod:post_player_init()
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
end

Mod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, Mod.post_player_init )
```
So how'd you reset it on player init?
hmm okay.
generates*
so i'd add that. if it's working rn it's probably only when you run luamod mod within the game context
Haven't tested but figure it generated a new player entity on run start
Hmm not sure about that
making sure to reset it on player init i guess yea?
yeah I do
you have player as a global variable i guess?
Something like that?
```lua
  function MyMod:fartByChance()
  if (player:HasCollectible(breakfastBurrito) then
    if (player:GetActiveWeaponEntity() ~= nil and player.FireDelay == player.MaxFireDelay)
      player:AddBlueFlies(3,Vector(0,0), target);
    end
  end
```
Yeah, didn't mean it in that way, sry
oh
"also"
oh
it will work if brim is charged
GetActiveWeaponEntity on brim
I think just testing if FireDelay hits a specific frame, either 0 or MaxFireDelay
i think it would not work on brim
That might be more efficient than checking every single tear every single time
Also, I'd probably check if FireDelay == MaxFireDelay
But does it work on normal tears?
And gives you the brimstone the player is firing
I tested a while ago and I'm 96% sure it triggers on brimstone
GetActiveWeaponEntity IIRC
yeah
Are you talking about getting the stuff the player is firing?
he wants 3 blue flies to spawn whenever the player shoots.
I fyou want brim
Actually
try to do something with it
there's probably an easier way than what I'm about to suggest
Okay.
not brim, or laser
and that works only on tears
yes
oh
but sax's code will trigger each frame each tear is in existence
yeah I don't think framecount works that way
```lua
     local entities2 = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
      for i2 = 1, #entities2 do 
        local e2 = entities2[i2];
        if e2.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and e2.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then 
--code
end
end
```
But at the moment I dont go into the IF statement
Just to test if I get into the IF statement
So at the moment I just want to add blue flies when the player shoots.
```Lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("BreakfastBurrito", 1)
local breakfastBurrito = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("BreakfastBurrito")
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function MyMod:fartByChance()
  if (player:HasCollectible(breakfastBurrito) then
    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    target = player;
  
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if(entities[i]:FrameCount == 0) then
      --isaacTears[countTears+1] = entities[i];
      --countTears = countTears + 1;
        player:AddBlueFlies(3,Vector(0,0), target);
      end
    end
  end

MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE, MyMod.fartByChance)
```
Right so I have fiddled a little bit and I am not sure if I am going in the right direction
I assume
you can do < instead of ~=
uh
ok thx
i need to use 3 then
oh
so it will just keep incrementing past
which ~= 10.5
isn't*
charge + 1 = 11
and charge = 10
let's say maxfiredelay = 10.5
wait
so as long as shooting and state is -1, the charge will increment up to maxfiredelay * 2.5
if shooting and charge is not equal to maxfiredelay * 2.5 and state is -1 then increment charge
if player:GetFireDirection() ~= -1 and holyBrimstoneItemCharge ~= Isaac.GetPlayer(0).MaxFireDelay * 2.5 and holyBrimstoneItemState == -1 then
      holyBrimstoneItemCharge = holyBrimstoneItemCharge + 1
    end
brimstone charge is going beyond the limit
ok but what's the broken part
i was lazy to look in the code
i used it just for example
guys
yeah lolvar not present in that doc.
also what isn't working here
I don't see lolvar anywhere in this
code
https://hastebin.com/aferidoteb.lua
but what code breaks?
and code breaks
yeah
my max tear delay changes when I pick up the sad onion.
lolvar is ``lolvar = lolvar + 1``
i'm doing ``if  lolVar == player.MaxFireDelay * 2.5 then``
so, when i pick Polyphemus it works, but when i pick up<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>it doesn't
oh
<@223869207748542464>
what's wrong with maxteardelay?
maybe
the keeper?
uh
https://redd.it/5oh0l8
WHAT
"ResourceExtractor got updated to include previously unknown file names"
i need to create a mod with name "FIX MAXTEARDELAY NICALIS"
i know!
oh!
Don't worry, it's not like he cares about tweets other than AB+ mods ¯\_(?)_/¯
i don't have twitter ¯\_(?)_/¯
Tweet Tyrone or smth ¯\_(?)_/¯
so, when i pick Polyphemus it works, but when i pick up<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>it doesn't
Are you saying you can use a different cache type because your mod has no items?
What?
erm
Good news is I can use it in my mod, since it has no items :p
It does, Kube?
Yeah
(as someone who's never used it)
i'm doing ``if  lolVar == player.MaxFireDelay * 2.5 then``
because my impression is every time it caches it completely rebuilds your stat
doesn't that break when you pick up an item that's got firedelay?
although wait
^
Use another cache although that's sorta awful
is there a way to fix it?!?!
:/
cos the cache for firedelay doesn't work
it seems to break when i pickup fireDelay up
but the callback for firedelay is
No
Is MaxFireDelay broken?
but it still doesn't S U C C
OK got the effect working
but the first and other bombs still dont do anything ._.
if I make the effect's parent the bomb, on the second bomb it sticks to it
I posted the code up above
...then you fucked it up
and all future bombs did nothing
the player
the second bomb spawned the pulling effect on me
It spawned it nowhere on the first bomb
Yeah
<@219159380094877696> Did you try parenting it like I said before?
okay
Nope, I think GetActiveWeaponEntity only works for stuff like brimstone
there's an EntityEffect.PULLING_EFFECT, but it spawns for 1 frame then disappears
Seriously though, how do I add the vacuum/pulling effect of those void maws and pits
hmm
Ok, not necessarily I guess. It just depends on whether the application would improve from it or not
<@96016391173332992> It wouldn't be stupid in every case :P
**S U C C**
How does I make bombs s u c c
```Lua
function madPack:vaccuum_bombs_effect()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(vaccuumBombs) then
    if vaccuumBombsAdded == 0 then
      player:AddBombs(5);
      vaccuumBombsAdded = 1;
    end
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 then
        local succ = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PULLING_EFFECT, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player); succ.Parent = player;
```
?
that would be stupid
Don't
Right.
If you want to seed the shots you can do RNG:Random kappa
Though I think I can go and check it now
Right. I'll try your suggestions out.
But check what does that do before you proceed with scanning every entity in the room every tick
I'm not 100% sure
EntityPlayer:GetActiveWeaponEntity
well
But from what I could tell it returns the last tear fired
I forgot what the exact function name was
<@126590786945941504> ye?
and for each tear do math.random
Guys
*sigh*
scan all entities
then make the tear's spawnerentity player.
Oh  sorry let me clarify. For each tear that isaac shoots.
you can do math.random() for every tear
and if they are, make isaac fart
you don't even need to check that
and see if they're a tear with framecount 0
You could just check all entities in the room
oh
For each tear that is shot I want there to be chance of isaac farting. That is basicly it.
Though it depends on what exactly you're doing
Probably PEFFECT
What modcallback should I use?
Right I will see if  I can get that to work
And then you check for whatever trigger you want with bitwise operators
It's just EntityPlayer:GetLastActionTriggers()
they'd be so useful
I wish I knew how the ActionTriggers worked
Well you are right about that ?
To be fair Found Hud, while an A-class dad joke, isn't exactly very intuitive
Always check the options is the aesop here
Yikes
Oh I hate this post https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5oh35j/isaac_afterbirth_missing_hud_2_not_working/
Ah alright.  But that is a way to do it. I was looking at doing something with the actiontrigger_SHOOTING
Note that GetFireDirection is only for what direction they're pressing, not necessarily where they're shooting, i.e. with marked it will still be -1 if nothing is pressed, and the direction it gives will not necessarily be where the mark actually is
if EntityPlayer:GetFireDiretion ~= -1 then ...
?
Hey guys. Do you have an idea of how to check whether the player is shooting or not`
FeelsOrphanedMan
That whole post could be taken horribly out of context
Kube, you've tried parenting?
It might just die when it has no parent
I'd try parenting it to an entity
there's an EffectVariant for it, but that just spawns the visual for 1 frame and thats it
Anyone know how the vacuum effect works?
sorry for bothering
welp it kinda works but heh
my bad
oh yeah now i understand
I don't understand
So I installed Mei mod....
So why would you play an animation on a loop?
yeah i realize
And it all runs instantly in one tick/frame
You do realise a `for` loop will just keep going until you return from it, in which case the next time you run it it resets, right?
Also
no i want him to play an animation when he has to spawn a reward
Don't tell me you're using an animation to tell how many bombs you have to spawn based on how far he is into the animation or something... Right?
Wait hold on
It's hard to tell what the issue might be from just this small snippet
ah, okay. but, that doesn't need to be a loop does it? Couldn't it just be a conditional for if counter is at least 1? And when is counter being decremented? It might be being decremented before it fully plays an animation
to check how many rewards he has to spawn
causeits a bomb bum i need to loop on the number of bombs he picked up
also, why is it in a loop?
awesome mod, <@109624258317033472>!
POST_RENDER is for text on screen at least i use it only for that , but FAMILIAR_UPDATE should work
in a FAMILIAR_UPDATE mod callback
You are calling this under the mod callback 'POST_RENDER" right?
it does nothing
but when it needs to change the animation
i can get the bum to play his float animation
yup sprite is familiar:getsprite()
Good to know I'm not the only one
i assume sprite is a variable set elsewhere?
'Madpack'
dw, i'm just as unoriginal
lel
I guess you can guess where that name comes from
Yeah, that's my mod, heh
hey guys , it seems i cant get my familiar to play certain animations for a certain condition , what would be the syntax ?
i currently have 
```lua
for i= 1,counter do

        --Play animation--
            if(not(sprite:IsPlaying("PreSpawn"))) then
                sprite:Play("PreSpawn",true)
            end ```
and lol 'the_flipping_of_isaac'
yeah like that flipskiz, but more range
nope , no error
whatchu need bruh?
Is there an error in the log drazeb?
Kinda like this? https://streamable.com/fqpsu
can anyone help me ?
constantly
makes isaac spew tears in random directions
would be a 'fountain' item
my idea
yeah ^_^
I was mostly talking about like in my video
And yeah, for small height it works nicely
Your item is really pretty
oh, right, of course
http://gfycat.com/FirmDetailedBarb
and I don't see why that wouldn't work
Great!
Oh man that made it so much nicer <@124088844181045249>
i currently have ```lua
for i= 1,counter do

        --Play animation--
            if(not(sprite:IsPlaying("PreSpawn"))) then
                sprite:Play("PreSpawn",true)
            end
```
hey guys , it seems i cant get my familiar to play certain animations for a certain condition , what would be the syntax ?
fun time
But awesome!
does it die from damage?
Just finished the Mod that was famous on reddit yesterday: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=844440401 Take a look! ?
get ready
my next idea
would be kinda fun and pretty
Item called a fountain pen: Literally shoots out a fountain of weak tears
oh well
a bit irritating, isn't as clean looking as it should be
has the same arbitrary limit
or well, kinda
fast acceleration up, slow feather falling down
at least I can say that ipecac works in the same way
make it look good
now you just have to fine tune it
cheers
nice
?
?
it worked!
doesn't accelerate for ever like it should
for some reason
Also, the tear falling speed doesn't go higher than something related to the acceleration
kinda pretty tho
```
        local customtear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, player.Position, Vector(5,0), player):ToTear()
        customtear.Height = -5
        customtear.FallingSpeed = -50
        customtear.FallingAcceleration = 2
```
that gave me an idea for an item
lol...
https://streamable.com/if2g3
Well, for some reason the tear falling speed works in the opposite way
try it yourself
let me try spawning tears
```Lua
local customtear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(5,0), player);
        customtear:ToTear().Height = -5
        customtear:ToTear().FallingSpeed = 50
        customtear:ToTear().FallingAcceleration = 2;
```
okay
It just explodes instantly
to 200
from -100
I tried every multiple of 10
set it to like, -5
too low range, then
Spawned tears still just explode instantly
it doesn't work with spawned tears?
only to tears the player spawns
it does look weird however
shame doing it to spawned tears doesn't work
```
        player.TearHeight = -10
        player.TearFallingSpeed = 50
        player.TearFallingAcceleration = 2
```
it started lagging a ton tho lol
messing with the values
Closest thing
how?
lol
So tear height works inversely
https://streamable.com/9u35n
*-25
tear height of my basic tears is -5
wtf
I still had to manually update the animations and such
The more I try mod cool stuff, the less I like doing so >_>
and all it did was change the .Variant value
yeah I tried using ChangeVariant()
>_>
Height doesn't seem to work either
oh ok
it's more about tears not doing what we want
you may just be looking at an old version of the documentation
did you figure out your totears issue
still just spawns high and falls slowly
tried setting waitframes to 0
I'll try out a few things
from the start
which means it's velocity isn't being updated
If you fire a tear, it doesn't start to fall down instantly
?
since the tear goes a while before falling down
what about wait frames?
that's what I'm getting from this
every single frame
it seems you have to actually call the falling speed set
also, I believe it's something with how tears work
it just spawns it high and it immediately starts SLOWLY falling
it doesn't
unless it goes up
it's set to -5 atm
then it'd hit the floor instantly
or a bit over
set the tear height to 0?
and slowly falls down
It spawns miles in the air
how so?
but it doesn't work anything like your graph
Nice
So it works?
due to that sentence
finally got it to work
it returns the tear entity
so they definitely are tears after I spawn them
it doesn't change it
I can spawn tears and then access them using GetRoomEntities and an if statement for ENTITY_TEAR
ToTear gives you back a EntityTear reference
also
dunno
I believe you have to do something for that
or whatever
I have no clue how to transform an entity to another type
Still gives the same error
well, here's the problem.
```Lua
local customtear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(5,0), player);
        customtear:ToTear();
        customtear.FallingSpeed = -3;
```
but still doesnt' have a member fallingspeed
It likes the totear command
it won't be a tear if you just spawn an entity
I updated my game 10 seconds ago
It should be a tear anyways
your game probably isn't updated
And if it isn't there
You aren't doing the to tear thingy
I don't know how to use actiontriggers either :/
Hey guys. How can I check if the player is shooting. I have found the ActionTrigger_SHOOTING but I have been unable to find a way to make use of it.
I know
Read the code i put.
You sure?
http://i.imgur.com/hln0aTl.png
But anyways yeah, spawned tears can't have their falling speed set apparently
also I don't have the ToTear() thing everyone is talking about?
wat.
```Lua
local customtear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(5,0), player);
        customtear.FallingSpeed = -3;
```
error: no member named FallingSpeed
>_>
but still always make the mistake of 'if value = true'
I've been coding for years now
An upside down u
And all you change is the constant value
https://streamable.com/rmlt4
And if the starting height is 0
With a start height of 15
<@219159380094877696> https://streamable.com/1jkwu

k is FallingSpeed. See what happens when you change it
nothing my reading comprehension is first grade rn
oh duh
Yay, back home, sprites loaded ?
tear height is the z length
falling acceleration is the z acceleration
Falling speed is the z velocity
what do you mean?
I doubt it's both velocity and acceleration
Is there a way to make a space item that changes music?
<@126590786945941504>
tear height would be the starting point
up
for the z value
and the acceleration.. well, the acceleration
falling speed would be the velocity
deceleration
<@166265383291060224> the entity variant is RED_CANDLE_FLAME the entity is ENTITY_EFFECT
is the falling speed really like
wait a sec
simply setting it to a high value will do that
well, yeah
depening on what you want
Literally in the shape of an upside down U
You would have to make a sort of mathematical model to make it proper
I want them to arc up in the air then fall down
Well, it depends what you want to do?
But to get a nice curve you'd need to update their value every frame
up is negative
or, negative value, rather
set the falling speed to a high value
acceleration is probably not neccesary to mess with
But how do you make them arc up first ._.
That will be TearFallingSpeed
Shut up, robobaby
I also wanna know how to make tears arc high and fall fast like the ones from boils/gushers
Like, in an ipecac item, or something
Meh, those are useful
Heh, I'll have to try that
Those two chance constantly, so you can't mess with them much
yes
And would doubling a tear's height make it double the range then?
and TearFallingAcceleration
You also have TearFallingSpeed
TearHeight
yeah
But yes, if it's in the game somewhere
But seriously how do I add range to my damn character XD
You can always do it manually
I mean
Tears have a field .HomingStrength and stuff like that so it's there somewhere
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/hit-the-target-with-a-deadly-homing-missile--active-8933
i mean i would have to change the direction of the entity towards a npc within a certain range, i have no idea how todo that :/
Is range just tear height?
Also really weird is how I can't find the range stat
So idk
I couldn't get it to work
If it's in the game, do that
hmm
I read somewhere it was BulletFlags.SMART, but that may be old
to some degree
Making things homing is actually surprisingly easy
yeah, to add it to a entity
Like, manually?
cause that sounds like abit of a task
no one would happen to know how to add homing?
apparently so ?
liar liar plants for hire
never mind i tell a lie, it comes under flame not fire
cause i cant find an 'entity' for its flame, so i would assume it spawns the effect, but can you give the effect collision?
does anyone know how the red candle works?
are there ever?
are there update notes for the new one?
haha
thanks. i tried to type it with the 'c'. im really not a smart man
and then the name
when you type in giveitem
you can get the id
oh
starting 511
spawn 5.100.  but what ID?
how would i go about spawning an item pedestral with an custom item on it via console?
But okay, thanks
Well yes, I'm just giving that as a simlpe example to reassure what'd be a const in the game
The entire damn game
That's what "works with vectors"
Drawing on the screen, player movement, player position, stuff facing stuff, beams, lasers, circles, everything
You want to know what works with vectors?
What
"for example an Angel boss beam"
cool
Today's update did that
Yep
someone told me that nicalis added toTear, is it true?
I mean, I'm only guessing it works woth vectors, but it seems logical
Like for example an Angel boss beam?
But you can't set X or Y, you can't Resize and you can't Normalize it
You'll find that you can read X and Y, you can get the length, you can get the vector Normalized
Basically, const objects cannot be modified
Sometimes you'll encounter const objects
I guess there is one thing, it's not about vectors but the OOP system in the API in general
Well, hmm
alright then this makes things easier ?
It's just standard vectors in programming
Nope
You can't multiply vectors, or rather you can apply one of the two multiplications
Right, I know that, is there something specific about it in Isaac?
You can add vectors, you can subtract them
Y represents the coordinates from top to bottom
X represents the coordinates from left to right
A vector is a set of two numbers, [X, Y]
Look up how they work in maths
my vote is still on jim
you can ask me
Do you guys know where I can look up some info on how Vectors work in Isaac?
well i vote for Silas <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
And Jean, I have been keeping a poll and the votes are even
Silaejah
lol!
Lol
That sounds like something you put on your feet to moisturize them not gonna lie lol
Or Elmasil
Splicing their names would mean Elaelas
El-Ma-Sil
A vampire, a skeleton and a zombie or something
Splice up their names lol
make a poll :p
Clearly I'll just have to make three ;D
Dang it's 3-3-3 for vampires now
I'm getting the hang of it, slowly
Oh haha
it's the first thing I'm doing
No no, I had trouble actually understanding how invincibility and changing rooms worked
And you had trouble removing the holy mantle's effect if you had both items?
A holy mantle with a random negation and a specified effect - Isaac will periodically spray out tears simmiliar to the little red blobs that grow and shoot blood tears aroun them until exiting the room and negating damage again
So holy mantle with a random effect on pop
An Item I'm making is supposed to have the chance of negating damage once per room and then start a new effect once damage has been negated until the end of the room
It'slike
??? XD
Right, that makes sense ? I'm just happy that I managed to finally work around the crappy Holy Mantle clone thing
Just tried to test out something new haha
From testing out stuff ?
Man, where do you guys get all this info from?
Is there more advanced documentation somewhere or am I missing something about the structure's logic?
Ah, alright I see
It means if the player has psychic slowing tears, so will the tear you spawn
All tears to inherit effects?
allow
I mean what does it basically do
How does that work?
So they inherit stuff
I know you can just set all spawned tear's flags to player.TearFlags
I don't, but I don't think so
Hey do you happen to know whether spawning a tear variant of 0 includes effects from other items (such as Tough Love) as a possible ter to be spawned
i did it! thanks for the help guys
Removing brad and Camille then, now it's between Elijah, Mael and Silas
I like Mael
Only name it Brad if it has the squarest jaw ever
Votes: 2, 0, 1, 2, 3
Elijah? Brad? Camille? Mael? Silas?
I have votes though
Not yet
You should name it Buffy just for the lols
You got your Vampire name yet?
Poke your eyes out asap :' )
He's trying to tell you something
They're small but still
Yeah haha
a bit overboard
Eight are like
I wanted a cactus so I can have something fresh looking in my room but
Wat
I mean
Came home to like eight new cactuses my father had promised me. Got them from some friend of his who laso had promised him
Sup
Hey yáll
I can't think of too much I'd want to do with that haha
What things
also, they finally added Entity:ToTear() so i can aactually do the things i want
although, afterbirth might have a seperate folder than rebirth
i believe so
i found 2 locations, 
C:\Users\User\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Rebirth and 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\84857488\250900\remote
Are they correct?
and know that if your save is on the steam cloud it will be in a different location than if it is not on the cloud
nice idea, i will for sure
make sure to back up your save if you haven't already
i want to keep my save honestly, i have it from years ?
i think i can make it with a tutorial or something to guide me a bit
hmm if you dont know what your doing try finding a save editor its best not to mess with cheat engine unless you know what your doing
i'm scared of doing some stupid things and ruin something
wait i don't even know where to start to be honest
ok so have you selected isaac using cheat engine?
greed one i already capped it and there is no need having it filled again am i right?
normal one
Nova are you talking about the greed donation machine or normal one?
i usually like to play legit but this time i accidentaly broke my 999 donation machine and i can't be arsed doing it again, a friend told me to try with cheat engine but well i don't know where to start, i just downloaded cheat engine and Mega Table CTAB+ 0.8
Nova what you tryna edit with cheat engine?
Hello! anyone who can help me a bit with cheat engine?
If im have a "dr fetus" how detec when rhe bombs spawn by e button or fire tears?
Or you can go see more historical accounts of vampires: http://listverse.com/2013/08/11/10-vampires-from-history-youve-never-heard-of/
But, what about CAINE with an E? Different!! or with a K! KAINE XD
Obviously I can't use Cain >_>
Most biblical vampire? Cain from Vampire The Masquerade. :V
And preferably slightly biblical
The problem being I want a vampire who isn't too classic haha
Classic vampires: Dracula, Alucard, Carmilla, Millarca, Ruthven, Nosferatu
Modern vampires: Lestat, Armand, Angel, Spike, Edward ((audible chuckling)), Stefan, Damon, Anita, Chocula
No!
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be an angel
i want to be an angle
Vampiro
Fine, I'll say it, DIO
jim
Aaand now that's done, any more ideas for vampire names?
Damn work, interrupting my modding
Trying to find the standard deviation and variance of the results from a sim
What kind of things could you be implementing?
Because my brain goes "well, i, so, uh, imaginary numbers, duh"
I'm so confused trying to read this
Note to self: **never** use `i` on paper
Been given some formulas to code into my game sims... yay...
Modding will have to wait a bit hehe
Silas: 1
imo
Silas sounds gr8
hmmm
Or just the classic 'Vlad'?
Baal?
Elijah? Brad? Camille? Mael? Silas?
Am I onto something?
Yeah, so jesus would be like an opposite vampire. And since vampire is kinda like the devil...
Well he has people drink *his* blood a lot.
theres a chance
But...
Sadly Lilith would be a good name
maybe he was
but was he a vampire
He's undead, right?
I am Dracula!
Jesus.
haha
its a very good name, yes, hahaha, yes , very good
*jojo reference*
Too obvious haha
Dracula
Or an Isaac themed vampire character
Also, anyone got good names for a biblical vampire?
You do have require if you use --luadebug
Without require it'll be rough tho
^
Oh
"twitch API docs" is what you want to google
dude, that's not how google works
I don't know twitch api haha
Try googling "how the twitch API works"
Are you doing "twitch integration" from Lua in a way that the Lua doesn't do twitch integration?
Simplest way to do it to start
Why read text from a file?
Nonono
Yeah, as in people can influence your game
Wat
If so, I can hopefully make it work
Twitch chat integration?
I just need to know if I can code in a way to read text from a file
I only started modding 3 days ago ;D
But I'm not sure where to start
I'm willing to do as much towards the twitch chat integration as I can
<@119871368543076354> I'll accept it and try it myself, but jeez it'll be tough
BTW, Have the Clamp methods always been there on Vector?
So, somebody's using the built-in luasocket to do twitch integration?
¯\_(?)_/¯
<@126590786945941504> okay that makes so much sense. thank you so much for all of the help! I'll message back if something comes up
Ok so <@219159380094877696> I'm gonna add you so that you can give updates on twitch integration, if you want to keep working on it
With AddCollectibleEffect
Then you modify the resulting TemporaryEffects
EntityPlayer:GetEffects()
Lemme check the docs
I'm not an authority in temporary effects, I haven't done anything with them, so maybe somebody who did is online here...
Yes!
Basically it gives you a chance of humble bundle
Yeah, like, you enter a room with enemies and you have a 50% chance to get the effect of humbling bundle?
But like for each room
In theory, you can just detect new consumables and spawn a new entity with the same type, variant and subtype
50% of doubling consumables in the room
But another thing is doubling individual items or disabling the effect, which I haven't messed with
Because you can easily apply the effect of an item, if it works with humbling bundle
Or 50% chance of doubling all consumables in the room?
Do you want 50% chance of doubling every consumable?
But, well
yeah xD
whatever the c++
To <@116386733905412105>
oh
No, not "what?" to you, max
"I'm sure that's in the lua"
Yeah I'm sorry. I explained that poorly
those two items affect consumable drops
...what?
I'm sure that's in the lua so I doubt it...
okay that is super helpful. one more question- the main function of the item is that it gives you a 50% chance of double consumables if you are at full red hearts, and 50% of no consumables if you have red heart damage. Is there a way to modify humbling bundle or contract from below for this?
I gotcha!
But vec2-vec1
And now it's hardwired into my brain
For some reason in my life I got used to saying "substracting" instead of "subtracting"
Oh fuck I keep saying "substracting"
is substracting like negative cuil
Though you might get away with just telling it to fly towards the player
You can get the position of the player, the position of the familiar, substract them and tell the familiar to move in the resulting direction
Well, I'm pretty sure there's no built-in "follow entity X at distance Y", so you'd probably have to code that yourself
Hey there! I'm kind of new to this and just had a question about a mod I'm making... I'm trying to make a familiar that follows you at the distance of Gemini, but it kind of looks like Spider mod. How do I make t follow me?
Alright, sweeeeet
as long as `otherEntity.Vector()` is a Vector attribute (like Position or Velocity)
As a basic example
So Entity.Vector() = otherEntity.Vector() + Vector(2,2) would work?
`local newVector = Vector(3,4) + Vector(2,2)`
exactly like that
Like (3,4) + (2,2) = (5,6)
How do I add two vectors together?
'Someone made a twitch chat mod for a streamer'
Oh sweet
First comment
could be a start :p
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhl1k/the_networking_of_isaac/
but idk how to use this API too good
I mean I get the idea of coding
All I'd need to start is a way to get twitch chat output in any format
I need to take some online programming courses in my spare time
If I had someone to start it out, I could code for hours making it all work
xD
I only worked on a C# Mod for like 2 months
I could do it, but I have no idea how the Twitch API works or how to even start
I have like .25 years of experience in html
same
Unfortunately, I'm not very talented when it comes to programming
I now need that ?
Exactly
ClusterTruck style
My god.
Or make chat do stuff to the game
Even more useful if you could somehow make chat appear in game
But very very useful
Damn that'd be tough I imagine
If that's possible
Speaking of streaming, I'm thinking of starting up a twitch integration mod
#TheDream
LAN party and dates on weekends
Work as a game dev and spend all my free time modding or streaming
Hahaha much better
Anyways, this is probably a better use of your time
Traded in my robux for about $2250 and left
Yeah, but still
When I hit 1mil profile views
Haha but I stopped years ago
Good news: roblox is actually still relevant
Got famous on old ROBLOX ?
well that makes sense xD
I have 6 years experience in Lua haha
how do you so fast
Or a character that eats hearts to survive
What would be a good biblical name for a vampire character
Wow
13 items modded, sprited and completed, yay ?
you would have to know the position of the last familiar in the chain i guess
An item/trinket that makes familiars orbit around you
Wait you've given me an idea
since, you know, orbitals are familiars
oh whoops, i keep getting familair / orbit confused
i thought Orbit is something for 'pretty fly' and similar that circle around the player. But i gues ill try it out, thanks ^^
It's got something to do with OrbitLayer but you'd have to know what orbit layer you want it tofollow and there's probably rules on when / how you update it
ive only seen FollowPosition and similar
like, how they normally do it?
is it possible to have a familiar follow the rest of the other familiars?
lol
I don't know if I want to have much to do with that audience from what I've seen D:
I think it's a project more suited to that audience.
No
did you ask the subreddit?
BTW, would anybody be interested in a mod "framework" that lets you define simple stat changing items like ```lua
items["Wings"] = {
    speed = 1,
    teardelay = -1,
    flight = true
}

items["Demon Heart"] = {
    teardelay = 15,
    damage = 10
}```?
so I'm still stuck manually changing sprites
too bad ChangeVariant() didn't work as expected
WOW
OH
Entity:ToTear() now exists
hi
hi
o shit ok

<@124088844181045249> where are your sprites?
Lol, good point

There's more people who can give good feedback there
How about <#267353315073982465> ?
If anyone has a sec, also tell me how my sprite attempts are ?
Also, <@126492058864189440> you can tell me what you think of my sprites. Don't need you to make anything for me, as I myself want to just get somewhat better at spriting myself.
Now Joe has something to do for the next month
I can send you the layout png if you want
Also, Joe, I think minichibis is already working on that, but if you want something to do, you could try to sprite a nice frame for my tetris mod
I use Photoshop
and maddogs
Just so you know, the "Habit" description is "Item Martyr" :>
pm me transit
But it's really intuitive
I need a sprite for 'Martyr'- an item that revives you as an angel upon fatal damage
Aseprite might throw you off with the custom pixelated interface
Joe I'm gonna need a lot of "drawn by Isaac" style sprites for what I'm working on
I'd also recommend trying out aseprite if you're just getting into it
I'm good at spitting but I'd rather spend my time coding
yeah dude what do you need
<@126492058864189440>, you able to help out?
I think sprinting is fine, even though I suck
Xiaphursius made most of my sprites
Like Xippy
<@96016391173332992> if you need sprites hmu
Plenty of people here are willing to sprite
Ah I have an old laptop so
6/13 items sprited
I hate spriting. If I could just never sprite again Id be happy
Love the thing
Yeah, I never regretted my graphics card purchase
Honestly tho
Making a sprite for an item takes longer than coding the item itself
oh dear
`gfx card`
It only supports OpenGL 2.1. I'm just glad I can run isaac.
Ah. I have the world's oldest gfx card so
Yeah, that
NVidia's technology to be precise
It's nvidia gpu stuff
Running stuff on the GPU in parallel
Honestly I don't even know what CUDA is
The thing is, I've seen the CUDA part of coding in C++, but I didn't even know lookup tables are a thing before I used Lua
I even made a semi-shitty ludum dare c++ game
hahah
fuck memory allocation tbh
I've done CUDA, but that's another branch
Did some C last semester
I mean
And I haven't gone much farther than that
That are like arrays but **resizable**
Been meaning to
Let's just say I was amazed when I discovered vectors
That's what I have the most experience with
Well
Same tbh
The only C++ I learned is, well, uh
Hah
It's OOP C++
If there's one thing I really have to learn
Anyway I'm the only mod online who's gonna yell at us
Move to <#205854782542315520>-nostalgia Kappa
Lol
That's a nice loophole
That's...
huh
Just not tboi
Modding*
This is about missing
This has been going on for a bit too long
Should we maybe move to <#252944868857348097>?
Just like industrialcraft 2 and buildcraft
I know all mod packs use it
lmao
"Just Enough Items"
Fuckin hell
Just like forge
But it has been the standard for years
yeah
I think theres a replacement for nei now
NEI is being abandoned with the newest minecraft
Yeah
Instead of tmi?
Actually
Is NEI the standard now?
I remember that mod
And yeah
I tried modding Minecraft with modloader. With just some game maker experience without the scripting. Gave up and learned myself java,
Never used it but remember
fuck yeah what a banger of a mod
Clay Soldiers Mod
There's also a mod that everybody who used to play modded minecraft will remember
Another remnant of the past was Too Many Items
Last time I played you installed forge and mod loader
Forge absorbed Modloader and ModloaderMP
Didn't even realize
There's FORGE now
There's a new one?
Yeah, risugami made the original modloader
Risu was modloader yeah?
I've done some coding in my life
TBH I'll never forget the nick Risugami
eh
Trippy, man
I remember back when BuildCraft didn't even have quarries
I member mc releasing back in 2011
Which is impressive, honestly
And so far, it doesn't seem to be slowing down
i learned Lua with computercraft <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
Probably as long as Minecraft will live
Because from what I've heard plenty of people learned on Roblox and that's still alive
How long is ComputerCraft going to be alive for?
So, yeah, that actually makes me wonder
So, the younglings will take over
18 here
18. Just about 19.
20 tbh
No idea how old are y'all, so can't tell if it's "not uncommon for **us**" :P
Well
It's not uncommon for us younger folks
If they implemented some coding stuff beyond the redstone that could be very valuable for teaching kids to code
Actually, I began coding because of Minecraft as well
I've got >2.2k hours in GMod
Modding minecraft was literally how I learned to code
Never messed with gmod much
Good old modded minecraft
Computercraft is fun
I've also used to play too much computercraft
Mostly through GMod
I've got used very much to Lua
Appreciated
Got to admit I am happy that my tool is getting some use from jean-alphonse though. It feels a little good to hear something you made is getting appreciate even if it is some of the worst code you've ever produced
Because somewhere deep in my head I think all scripting languages are the same apparently
Although now that I've used lua a bit I'm getting psyched out by the "end"s and trying to put them in my python code too
Python is the language I use most on a regular basis tbh
I hate it for significant whitespace, but that's about it
I think (1,3,2) would be as we'll so not just pairs
TBH I don't know much about python
(1, 2) is a tuple in python
Like a list but... Not?
Pairs of variables?
Aren't tuples, like
but
Python
...what
Or a tuple!
That you evaluate before returning a level up
If you parse a language, () is simply a nested block
I mean, it's only reasonable
Yeah, it is valid
Haha
I'm not 100% sure
Why not?
Why?
Wait, require(("test")) is valid lua?
Which... It might
Haha
And then it wouldn't work for require(("test")), unless python supports recursive patterns
I'm not sure how to do that without, well, writing 2 more special cases
It doesn't let you have () at all
Mine does I know
Does it mess up with require("test" ?
But shrug
Lmao. I mean to be fair like I said before you may as well allow small errors like that since their intentions are clear
It's like a puzzle game
Why not?
I just decided to include not allowing "test' because, hell
and looks like I bounced a soccer ball on my keyboard
This one is just quirky
"efficient"
no matter how well- and efficiently-defined it is, it's still ugly
Disagree, EatMe. I just can't write them :p
`require\s*?["']((?:(?<=").+?(?="))|(?:(?<=').+?(?=')))["']`
Well
fixed that
beautiful regex is an oxymoron
oh right
oh
It's better than mine, though, and I can make it ugly and awful to account for that later if you don't mind me vomiting all over your beautiful regex
????
But not with `require "te'st"`
It apparently breaks with `require 'te"st'`
Fair.
Well, the regex I have right now doesn't account for ()
Also btw can you shoot me that regex in a private message so I can replace my shitty one once I'm back on my computer?
It includes piping and some of the basic utilities like grep, cat, etc
The windows cmd.exe can be pretty good if you get clink
There's one thing I'll just randomly note
I've just got too much muscle memory
Like honestly speaking using non-vim like editors feels genuinely unnatural to me at this point
I also unironically use vim so I'm a pureblooded Linux elitist too lmao
For now.. Eh
If I had a second machine I'd probably set it up with linux simply because I wouldn't be risking locking off my access to my computer
I'll probably switch sometime in the future
Same
I'm using windows because fuck me I'm too lazy
yep
Lol, typical Linux elitists
I think windows peaked already tbh
Omg
Mostly by my doing
I grew up using linux and if he helped me install linux on my first computer instead of threatening to take away my only LiveCD if I don't do it myself I'd probably have never asked my friend for a WinXP CD
So is jer actually
Really? No yeah I'm an actual unironic arch Linux user
TBH I'd probably be using linux today if not for my brother
Also it installs to the "build" mod directory lol
Damn
To be fair my makefile would have one line in it before I lost interest
Which is lazy
For example make install only works on Linux for it
To be fair my makefile isn't exactly perfect
It's a wonder I managed to compile aseprite
Yeah, I just never got around to learning make and shit
I do everything in shell anyway so no real reason not to
I just like them :p
Because I'm the pre-Y2K asshole who still uses make
*cries*
lol makefiles
see ya
Lol I use a makefile for it personally
Thanks for the help guys, I've fixed up some stuff, will continue at home
riight i'll have sublime do it thanks
Then you just press ctrl+B instead of ctrl+S
Erm, you're on windows, yeah?
If you use sublime, you could create a build system that runs it
To be fair it's pretty much just a private tool I released for people to use.
i see! do you know how to have modrequire.py run every time you save main.lua ?
Bleh, regex.
`require\s*?["']((?:(?<=").+?(?="))|(?:(?<=')\w+(?=')))["']` matches `require "test"` and `requre 'test'` but not `require "test'` :D
hm
It makes everything so much cleaner
Why *wouldn't* I do that?
Also you're right though, thinking about it! Overwriting require is so much more functional
Yeah
transit are you Asterne ?
ohh, python has lookbehind
no skin off of my teeth
like
oh neat
ToTear was added
also true, but honestly if they accidentally put require "test' then i see no reason to not replace it anyway lmao
yes
there's an update ?
I didn't think of that, since I was just thinking of how browserify does it
yo
I'll just try to write my own
Also, of course, the regex fails at stupid stuff like `require "test'`
that's fair I guess
Instead of putting `require` in as a function with every subfile as a function
?
Because they do that, right?
replace the require
Why does everybody like
y'know what
That's what I used to test it lmao
regex101.com is dope
I tested it on all 4 I stg
Let's see
python
What language is that a regex for?
I tested it
It does!
yeah. and I want to match both the full string and the actual package name
Are you sure that regex works properly?
Also
You want to detect `require("asdf")`, `require('asdf')`, `require "asdf"` and `require 'asdf'`?
i'm so dumb
I don't need it anywhere in it
So, just to be sure
wow
fuck you're right
I
good question honestly
if ryou is here, this is the mei creator. i was already here but i guess i'll just come back
Why do you have ?: everywhere
(I'm trash at parsing in general)
just
so i put it in lmao
it worked
I just
I didn't even simplify it after
erm
for my shitty modrequire tool lmao
I literally made this regex earlier because I'm not a real person 
```
((?:require(?:\(|\ )(?:\"|\'))(.+)(?:\"|\')(?:\))?)
```
And I even ended up making a damn RPN language in JS
One in Lua and one in JS
transit what mods have you made?
I made two infix expression calculators
Do you hate yourself? Because that's what parsing makes me do
And I realised I've done too much parsing
I think I can say for sure this data will be better structured than in my last mod, though, so that simplifies
"What's my specialization"
I've been thinking
I'm not here for a nice exercise. More of a nice mod :p
Though making that stuff without recursion is probably a nice exercise
Yeah
lol
not the data being recursive
You basically have to create a lookup table of table IDs
i was talking about recursive serializing and deserializing
You need to account for that
nevermind
that's what you meant
You'd keep going deeper and deeper
Oh!
If you tried to serialize that
If you have a table `t = {t, t}`
Basically
lmao
Sorry, how does recursion make it more complicated? I was just thinking through how it would make it simpler in my head
Well, it ain't my specialty either, the best I've done with serialization is abuse the library to break out of a sandbox
And handle that
Because now you'll have to index every table inside the table
not my speciality for sure
Recursion makes it a little bit more complicated if you want to preserve it
Fair enough I guess. I just don't have a ton of experience with serializing data tbh :\
Making a nested table serializer/deserializer is simple as long as you can assume no recursion
Hi everyone ! I have trouble removing hearts from the player because EntityPlayer::AddBlackHearts(-2) removes a black heart and change a soul heart to a black heart. Any idea how I could do that ? (remove the last 3 hearts of the player)
Well
haha
that was just me being tired and lazy and up wayyyy to late
Ah, ?
nonono, I moved past that
That, uh, looked quite different
And if you're talking about what you showed in the code you showed us...
but i'm going to need to store more complex data for this mod I think
Can serialize strings, booleans and numbers
https://hastebin.com/hikofalovo.lua
I did similar
¯\_(?)_/¯
I made myself a shitty simple flat table serializer
I'm so lazy about it
I need to make a decent wrapper function for Mod:SaveData and Mod:LoadData soon tbh
Looks like Config is still broken
oh
Okay, time to test around with Config
Though not sure how does it work with familiars across rooms
But it returns the very same table every time you call it on the same entity
But it returns a Lua table
Forgot the exact function
Try Entity:GetData() IIRC
because my work around for my bees is getting ridiculous
oh yeah btw does anyone know if you can store variables in familars other than state?
blegh
like I had figured out tons of things before half of anybody had even stopped complaining
But better don't tell swift
oh yeah true I guess
Then you can instantly release when they let you put the boss into the pool
literally
no, same Kube
Get those sweet early views
But joe, if you do that
I had to come in and be like "y'all. it's better than what we had. stop dragging your balls"
don't want a fully functional boss that won't spawn in game
TBH Everyone was whining and in the meanwhile I was making my first mod
tbh I wanna know if I can actually do it in the API before I put the work in to code his behaviours
I remember at the beginning everyone was whining lmao
"Oh no"? Did I offend you? Lol
^^^
People just fucking tried instead of asking everybody
That's how the best mods are made
Try it ¯\_(?)_/¯
So can you like add a boss to the boss pool and give him a splash art and everything
Now Iknow why FlipskiZ is always online at the same time as me
And oh no
just make it work :p
yep
Can't reason with that shit
It's 11.30 am here
Oh well
but
I personally can't handle staying up later than 1AM
Oh right
Well for me Kube this sleep schedule helps with my depressionfor some reason
pm not am
NZ fam
Fellow Europe brother <@126492058864189440>
12:30 pm here :/
Why do people even stay up that late
tfw its only 11.30pm here
It's... what, 5:30am? I'm usually fine until 7 >.>
Hey, at least you can code at all <3
I'm so dumb I dont think I've ever been able to code wheey :' )
ugh i'm so tired i don't think I can code anymore
Mb
Is what I'd use
Yeah, sorry Game():GetRoom()
level:GetCurrentRoomIndex()
Floor():GetRoom()? Game():GetRoom()
Where did you even get that?
Room():GetRoom()
room enter callback when
what
honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they compared room seeds in the C++ code kappa
.-.
I think I found where I had gone wrong. I was trying to tell Room() to get the frames, not a Room():GetRoom()
^
This is one of those fucking things that need some degree of official support
Realistically
ye
I mean Forget Me Now starts a new room with fresh Frame counting
The GetFrame would fix that right?
Fair, but *realistically* room seed ain't gonna be the same you've got to admit
So good luck with that
And the floor stays the same
The seed I think is random, so it can theoretically stay the same
The room index can stay the same
Forget Me Now
lmao
There's one thing you can't account for
so arguably worse
actually I was comparing RoomSeeds in mine
I think it's in Game, maybe in Level
Also, I'd personally use CurrentRoomIndex or whatever the function was
fair enough tbh
Not a fucking number comparison
You should be bothered by "Creating another Game instance every frame"
like dude
Is that really bothering you
at all
but it doesnt seem to work
"doing a number comparison every frame"
I've been trying to do that
I had a look around and I couldn't find another
one sec let me check my other mods
i feel like there was
urgh
Is there any other way?
why
>doing a number comparison every frame
local room = Game():GetRoom()
if room:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
<@172780123504771074> Check if room index changed
oh, really?
detect*
Somebody has to check after the update
FireProjectiles and FireBossProjectile are/were broken
lowkey do you guys have any idea how to make the code detece you;re entering a room ._.
I'd make enemies if I knew how
Actually
Because, well, the game has an additional overlay it draws on top of everything
And *no one* wants to make enemies almost
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=843418469&searchtext=
Shameless plug for the bee mod
That always just seemed really funny to me because everything else in the world was broken
And too desaturated
The sprites look a bit dark to me
Funnily enough, it's actually magnificently easy to create enemies and has been from the very beginning, even when the rest of the API was lacking
That's actually sick
Nice sprite
Is that a fucking bee beehive
Trying to add this to the bee mod
Are there any mods in the workshop which add a boss?
And it's really the game's fault
I don't even know if it really is vectors
but shrug
I mean to be fair if that's the cause of the problem it might be a good idea
But, eh
And mess around with self-modifying operations on the C++ vectors instead
I could try to, y'know, use custom Lua vectors
Those are some C++ vectors after all
If it doesn't clean up vectors, that sucks
Just got to work, time to continue modding
And I create and throw away a lot of vectors
I think the game doesn't properly clean up the vectors
I wonder how much harder it would be to make RPG stats in the lua api than how you're making jt
I've got some ridiculous memory leaks it'd seem
Probably less than my tetris http://i.imgur.com/BaN6kAj.png
3 gigs or go home
erm
I wonder how much lua memory this fucking overhaul of a mod i'm making is gonna use actually
barely fuckin runs
not on my computer
lmao
Wait, Isaac runs at 60fps?
Yeah, AFAIK `Game():GetFrameCount()` returns the amount of ticks since the beginning of the run. It's saved when you exit and continue, and it can be used to get the amount of seconds since the beginning of the run.
I don't think that I have used that
Not sure if I tested Game, I think I used Isaac.GetFrameCount
Not in my experience
And made a big jump after pause
Game():GetFrames is 30 per sec when the game is running
Advanced 2 every tick
With the framecounts
I tested too
Unless various stuff behaves differently
I have tested
The game is interpolated
No
Yeah, but the frame stuff is 30 per second
And 2. The game still renders while paused
Because 1. The game renders at 60FPS and runs at 30TPS
And no <@124088844181045249>, frames aren't ticks
Tetricon
Also, I'm not sure if I'm going to call the mod tetris, looks like you can get into enough trouble just by making a tetris clone, not sure what would I call it though
Yup, it does not spawn a new item, it's counting the frames since the start of the run, but I thought that Room():GetFrameCount() would return frames since entering the room
Afaik
Also, frames should also be ticks
It should work
Also, IIRC the frames advanced when the game was paused
Have you checked what happens if you restart and continue?
I wouldn't trust that, but ¯\_(?)_/¯
as a condition for an if
is via*
Number of frames since start?
Because the way I spawn my collectible item at thestart of the game is  via  via Game():GetFrameCount() == 1
I'm pretty sure GetFrameCount in general isn't usable because it returns number of frames, not ticks
erm
except the entire massively multiplayer online bit
#litteralySlaughtered
i guess
but yeah.. sorta, winter
Kappa
Update #2: Also
Room():GetFrameCount() does NOT return the frames since the start of the room
Update: Apparently
binding of isaac mmo
(eden can get any skill is my plan)
like I said, 13 requires in a single file just for the frickin character trees
It's gonna be a hell of a mod
Hope so!
The idea, that is
Well, I meant that it will be a good mod
it's going to remove items. If that's not an overhaul idk what is :p
Yeah, of course
Yeah, that's what I'd been trying to do. Since I'm probably one of the people that knows the API better here, I've been able to more or less conceptualize how different bits *can* actually be done, even though it's a major overhaul
It definitely would work well as a conversion mod, imo
I though about a similar thing before
sounds very much possible though
but I love the idea so I wanted to go for it
ambitious
It's.......
It will also have active skills that are switched between using the "use card" button and used with the spacebar button
:>
preferably that know the "limits" of the api
so I sort of need to find some people who're willing to sit and creatively brainstorm the characters' skill trees
But there's a *lot* of skills to put together and stuff
I tried to take after nuclear throne a little bit since it's the only game similar to isaac that has anything resembling skill trees
It does sound interesting
Stuff like that
And they'll be along the Momma's Boy and Daddy's Boy trees (in my head -- i'm just a programmer)
etc
the other type becomes locked off to you
but once you pick one type
Isaac's will have skills that are either angel or devil aligned
Also, there are going to be separate trees for separate characters
is the plan
Basically gives you a random selection of options based on prerequisites
And you can pick those now too
2 randomly show up
Maybe if you can get some items in there
there are 5 subsidiary skills
you pick a skill
for example
but to keep there from being an "optimal" tree and it getting boring
How does that work with randomness?
Yeah, exactly
So you have to progress through them to unlock more?
Tear status effects
Yeah
Is it even a tree?
Wait
Isaac can reroll of course
Well, an obvious idea is multishot
(selection of skills, select random from them, those are your options)
heh, skill tree
But there's a history of tetris clones being forcibly removed by the company
It removes items and has a semirandom skill tree instead
Also, anyone willing to come brainstorm skill ideas for the mod I'm working on?
I don't think copyright holders care about a small mod
It's about I care :P
It's about who cares
fair enough I guess
It's not about being "old enough"
Yeah
think it's old enough
Tons of other mods are called that no problem as far as I know
and stuff like that
There are a lot of webgames that are called "tetris" or something tetris
Copyrights
Why not?
I haven't really done any research
I think so
I wonder if I can even call the mod tetris
I'll probably have to create a GUI menu for tetris
but I'm really gonna hate getting to the end and actually having to work on it
because I hate making GUIs because I only use command line shit anyway
Also I'm sorta being awful and putting off the GUI work on the mod I'm working on
yeah i mean. I guess that makes sense
huh
fair enough

lol
Then cut it off to a certain length xD
I'd love to see that
Use a sprite the length of, what was it, 1024?
Please.
Wait how the dick did you draw a line
I can give you my debug minimod that includes a function to draw a line between two points
?
to be fair, I just wanted a non-moving rendering
Oh wait, I have the line drawing code, duh
Huh gotcha
And if you want it to advance, you have to Update the sprite every frame
fair enough
You might also have to play an animation
I did that after
Oh
¯\_(?)_/¯
You forgot to either LoadGraphics or pass true as second argument to Load
That's what I had
Oh, I commented out the code
Though I think-
```lua
TSoI.tree.bg_sprite = Sprite()
TSoI.tree.bg_sprite:Load('gfx/fuckall.anm2')
```
and
```lua
function TSoI:post_render()
  TSoI.tree.bg_sprite:Render(TSoI.tree.top_left, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
end

[...]

TSoI:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, TSoI.post_render )
```
I currently don't have any public mod that uses sprites, but I can give you the "directional movement" WIP
Thanks!
(I already deleted it but let me find it farther up)
EntityPlayer:GetMovement/ShootingJoystick()
Well, show code
How did you get the player movement keys?
no error
don't render
and because I hate gui coding which is what this is for
And they don't render at all or do they error?
I'm also thinking about trying to make a breakout game, should be simple enough.
just as a test for now
lmao
as in, just accessing the ones in the game files
I'm using ones already in the game
Well, are you sure the png files for the anm2 files you're using are in the right folder?
How do you render sprites on screen? For some reason I've been struggling with that, although it might be because I'm too lazy to make my own anm2 and am using ones that won't work for it
I've got a bit too much Lua experience from the past ¯\_(?)_/¯
Oh, that's you!
Also maybe I'm you but better, who knows, but I've done some mods, including the fooking WIP tetris
oh! interesting
Well, my mod doesn't add consumables but lets you hold more than 99 of them
Are you me but better?
I used my new game code in my consumables mod ironically
Ah
I use that code in my ExtraConsumables mod
No, I mean
i'm tired of dealing with consumables already
I have my own extraconsumables code mate :p
Not in my experience
So... Want my full ExtraConsumables code?
You're *sure* that framecount doesn't reset
But it appears to detect a new run fine in POST_UPDATE
And doesn't work in POST_PLAYER_INIT because the level isn't initialized
It probably has redundant bits
Room():Getframecount
You can also check when it's 0
I made this little thing ```lua
local function isNewGame()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    return game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1
end```
It does, but
Game():getframecount gives you frames since the run start
lol
and checking if it was the same
Hold on
i was storing the seed and all
how do you do that in post_update
?
wait
Because if yes, all you have to do is set a flag in POST_PLAYER_INIT and on that flag check if it's a new game in POST_UPDATE
on_player_init runs on continue as well
yes
By "on game start", you mean new game?
erm
Though if they're asking about the basics, I can't be arsed to help them
ugh time to add my overcomplicated on game start callback
And don't get me wrong, I don't mean people coming here like "Wait, I don't understand, what does this function do?"
but fair enough
they'll both be problems imo
^
The problem is skids who copypaste code from other people then come here complaining it doesn't work
The problem isn't "subpar modders"
"subpar modders"
And there are gonna be even more I'm bettin ya
Eh, there already a ton of low-effort mods
no offense to subpar modders
the wiki's just opening the floodgates to a bunch of subpar modders
I think it's better without the wiki tbh to a certain extent. My thoughts are if you can figure out the API you can make good mods
Since that works well for coding
I also hope it gets a similar layout to the documentation page
I'm basically ignoring the wiki
fuck wikis
noope nevermind, I don't even know where to go at it from this layout
Maybe I can help out somewhat
I'll look into the wiki when I come home
Well, I'm at school rn, so I can't
I'll do it, damnit
*thinks about adding it on the wiki* 
*groans about adding things to wiki*
Yes, and spread the word
So, use rng class whenever possible
Actually good to know
fairly well done actually
so you can seed separate things without interfering with other stuff depending on the order it happens
but it "starts over" with the seed
the seed is the same
Also, apparently each instance of the RNG() class is its own seeded thing
with the search andcould not find crap
Ayy problem somved
I swear I looked for it
same, although sometimes i'll also have to console from launching steam open so I can also show "print" calls
nevermind I think I found it
I do all my debugging through the log file
lmao
oh
I'm askin hexanix if his does haha
one sec
It does.
So when you type 'luamod modname' does it put something in the log
Render text under the Isaac page allows you to print text on the screen in-game. Really useful.
It's in the game itself, maybe I'm not looking in the log correctly
Im picking it up ?
Yes, hah, I see the item htat I modded in
Sounds silly but have you enabled your mod etc? XD
There should be?
You have to have a global bool for that item being picked up and check it in POST_UPDATE, and if the player:HasCollectible() then you update it
There is no mention of the mod being loaded either
There is no callback for picking up items
And no it doesn't say that I've pickedu p items
What would that be?
Also you may consider using render text too
Does it say when you pick up items, even?
cya man
Right, the log is in the Afterbirth+ of MyDocuments, right? But the log doesn't mention anyuthing about me picking up the modded item even though I AM picking it up
kek
time to work as a game dev
cya
well im off
I'm not fully sure, but it seems like the range stat in FoundHUD is literally just `player.TearHeight`.
Yep. I know. I just checked it because there was an update.
the one thing I REALLY can't figure out is how to change a player's range...
that item also gives shot speed so i used shot speed
Just have to accomplish it using other cache flags
```Lua
function madPack:pica_paint_stats(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(picaPaint) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SHOTSPEED then
      if player.MaxFireDelay > 4 then
        player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay - 2;
      end
    end
```
Yeah, that's what I meant by broken.
it doesn't work
If you are, don't.
are you using the cache FIREDELAY?
maxFireDelay is fine for me
lol
so it had immediate effect
MaxFireDelay seems to still be broken.
Trust me, at first I was debugging stuff by making the player damage the int I was trying to find
I keep forgetting the debug strings ffs
see if it sets the string low
make it debug a string, and run into a room
Im trying to
just test it
since the room was loaded i assume
Does Room():GetFrameCount() return the frames since the room has been entered or since the game's start?
I'd say that's a success haha
Paint Bombs, in 20 minutes!

Ohh it works wonderfully
It must be because they added EntityTear later and just forgot to add ToTear
Makes sense honestly
I feel like they should have uploaded a mini bug fix update for that, though.
I guess that they simply forgot about it. So they added it now as they should.
hallelujah
yes
did you say ToTear()
wait
Well, I'm not going to check the subreddit because I'm not going to use that, but gj I guess
Modrequire
check the subreddit
I made a tool for it
compiling it in
Was require reenabled or are you compiling it into your mod?
erm
welcome to hell
also tfw a single file in your mod need 13 imports
https://ptpb.pw/lM48.lua/lua
Also somebody should check EntityPlayer.MaxFireDelay
thank jesus
seed is run-unique
yes
New update?
Somebody has to check Config in-game :>
Nope
Is there a change log?
what else is new?
Fucking finally
Entity:ToTear()
There it is
yep
the input handling
that would make the mod i'm working on 1000x better
I'm hoping for ToTear so that all those people would stop complaining
Doubt it, sadly
It's downloaded
*crosses fingers* input handling, input handling, input handling
I'm downloading it
oh, update? quick, someone see what's new in the docs :p
27MB
but the seed itself should be run unique
you can get random from a seed
Isaac update!
OMG
sweet!
that's not what Seed means
so shouldn't it be generated at the moment of execution and not  put into the seed at the start of a run?
Paint bombs works ?
like Slot Machines
I mean it's something that get decided at the moment
Shouldn't it be a seed of its own?
i'm gonna test it out ;-;
but you initialize a new RNG object so i'm scared
no idea
it'd be stupid if it was the second
Y'all know if RNG gets the game's seed or a seed of its own?
so it's tough to figure out simple things
And don't worry, the API isn't great
^_
Made the paint bombs shoot colored tears that make rainbow creep now
oops
DAMAGE*
```Lua
elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 then
        entities[i].Color = Color(math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), 1, 0, 0, 0);
      elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i]:IsDead() and EntityTear.SpawnerEntity == player then
        local paint = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
        local rainbow = math.random(1,6);
        if rainbow == 1 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
        paint.CollisionDamage = (player.Damage * 4);
        paint:GetSprite().Scale = Vector(1.8,1.8);
        paint:GetSprite():Update();
```
I was trying to make weird when someone on the Discord told me the DMAGE modcallback had to return false
was*
it as kind of shameful tbh
Yeah it took me a day to figure out how invincibility worked
Well you're ways ahead of me I've been in this for about 4 days but
I've been modding for 3 days now
pretty much haha
to me I guess I need more practice
that are*
Also Vectors are something that's a bit odd
why entities[i]
and just make a for loop to call it X times
you'd do something like:
```Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(math.random(3,7),(math.random(2,6) - 4)), player);
```
If you want a monstro's lung effect
```Lua
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(7,0), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(7,7), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,7), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(7,-7), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,-7), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(-7,-7), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(-7,0), player);
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 0, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(-7,7), player);
```
worked first try xD
and travel as I wanted
Well, I can make tears spawn
AKA just at the tear spawning
Here's where I'm at with my paint bombs:
```Lua
function madPack:paint_bombs_effect()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(paintBombs) then
    if paintBombsAdded == 0 then
      player:AddBombs(5);
      paintBombsAdded = 1;
    end
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP and entities[i]:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode") and entities[i].Variant ~= BombVariant.BOMB_TROLL and entities[i].Variant ~= BombVariant.BOMB_SUPERTROLL and entities[i]:GetSprite():GetFrame() == 1 then
```
so it can never be white or black
where RGB are either 0, 255 or somewhere between
KubeRoot, i circumvented that by adding 6 possibilities
huh right that sounds logical actually
I need a splash effect simmiliar to Monstro's or those little growing blobbie and maybe something to imitate a parasite/cricket's body effect
But if you just randomize RGB, sometimes the tears will be black or gray
Well, HSV, HSL, there's multiple similar ones
that's pretty useful
Basically, the reason to use HSV is that your colors can be basically only stuff from the exterior of this circle https://learn.pimoroni.com/static/repos/learn/unicorn-hat/hsv-top.jpg
doing paint bombs that spray paint and tears everywhere
I'm looking into that atm
Tear spawning is what I gotta really work on
but
Well first I spawned stuff for testing like batteries and random pickups and that was fine
I have work from 9-7, i know your pain
With school on the side it's a bit harder
what are you trying to spawn
I havent looked into modding any colors currently, I've been trying to wrap my mind around invincibility and spawning the last few days
Basically with HSV with S and V set to 1, you can always have bright and colorful tears without hardcoding anything
and they scale off enemy size:
```Lua
splosion:GetSprite().Scale = Vector((entities[i].Mass + 40) / 100, (entities[i].Mass + 50) / 100);
```
the paint splats are nice looking
it worked wonders using this, so I'm happy haha
And use that
You should get HSV2RGB code from somewhere
ehh
Colored Effects/animations: 
```Lua
elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i]:IsDead() then
        local paint = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
        local rainbow = math.random(1,6);
        if rainbow == 1 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 255, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 2 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 255, 0); end
        if rainbow == 3 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, math.random(0, 255), 255); end
        if rainbow == 4 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, math.random(0, 255), 0); end
        if rainbow == 5 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 0, math.random(0, 255)); end
        if rainbow == 6 then paint:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), 0, 255); end
        paint:GetSprite():Update();
```
Colored Tears:
```Lua
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 then
        entities[i].Color = Color(math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), 1, 0, 0, 0);
```
I've done that the first day I used discord I think
I mean, disable discord's automatic emote conversion
take a note of these:
A LAUGHING FACE UGH
feel free to haha
WHY IS :' )
I might hit you up for help ?
It was worth it right? :')
Im working on a clown set of items that also should use painted tears for one of them
That's really cool.
http://gfycat.com/HarmoniousFragrantGoldeneye
so glad my pica paint item worked wonders last night even if i'm gonna be late for work... :/
oh and mornin'
yes i do know
TAB is your friend remember that
I never understood how people can not indent code haha
Just a quick question on my side - the IsInitialized() method of Room class returns true if the Room has JUST been initialized(i.e. you have just entered it ) or if it has been initalized already?
ok i did the thing
This is what properly indented code looks like
```lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end

  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
    end
  end

  local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")

  if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
    end
  end
end

MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)```
i don't know
i think
my code is indented
But please, indent your code
No, nvm, that looks right
you can never have too many ends
I'm not sure though
what should i do then
oh
But it looks like you might have too many ends
I don't even know what's going on with that broken indentation
urgh
this is getting long
this should be fine, brokenVhs that is
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.5;
    end
  end
  
  local brokenVhs_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken VHS")
  
    if player:HasCollectible(brokenVhs_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 1;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
anyways all rage aside
still end me
ok i'm fine now
The thing is I just don't want to waste my time if nobody's gonna be interested
i request fuCKING ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THIS BULLSHIT IS STUPID AND END ME
once more
I think a closer audience might be on the subreddit
You'd basically take the main.lua file with the framework and add your code along with the above to the bottom of that framework file
'cause I could probably make that in like 20 minutes and many people seem to be struggling
Okay, serious question, would anybody be interested in a mod framework that lets you add stat upgrades like ```lua
items["My Item's Name"] = {
    speed = 2,
    damage = 3,
    shotspeed = -5
}```
<@!95444500364660736>  I actuall found out what was wrong, thanks
Why must every line of code I write screw up?
yay learning
i dew
yes
do you understand how that change fixed it?
AYYY
yeah you can
let's find out
I think you can do it all in the same cache update function
I didn't do any optimizations
oh god the tts
```lua
function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")
  if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end

    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
end
```
Don't care about the stupidity of the question just want to get this fixed and work on some costumes.
no question is stupid
Of course not.
Wait that was a stupid question.
How should I fix that? Just remove the second function?
you're declaring a function inside of a function
Good point.
I see a lot of code throughout my day.
And you've been here multiple times haha.
Won't get move speed or damage, thought'd you know due to the fact that I've said this way too many times than I should've.
<@227262590697340928> what's not working with it?
Just make sure to @ me so I get the notif.
Okay I'll wait.
Nobody's on are they?
Grill works perfectly fine.
And by item I mean cricket's collar by the way.
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
Still trying to make this item work, nothing's going right or wrong.
ok i'm too lazy for this shit nevermind
urg it's not in luarocks
ehhh... nevermind i might just use luaminify to be lazy
As long as I take it one step at a time
It's not as difficult as I thought.
Wait. Nevermind.
it seems fun
and I really want to do that
Simple minifying is easy but uglifying it is going to be awful
I think I'm going to put together something to try and minify it next. but that's going to be a pain
cool
but it works
It has like one feature total and doesn't cover any edge cases
Release.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5ogfbh/modrequire_a_tool_to_make_it_possible_to_manage/
And these files seem to be what set it for a card:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx005.302_suit card.anm2
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx005.301_tarot card.anm2
But I have no idea how to make a new custom tarot card point to a new file.
Anyone have a clue how to give a custom tarot card a custom back image while it is on the ground, or if this is even possible right now?
I know for a fact cards use the image at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx\items\pick ups\pickup_017_card.png
Show your code that doesn't work.
I think it never gets to it or it always does, unsure need to check my pc again but Im still just curious
Does not work at all?
Via an if with a math.random(3) == 1 condition in a TAKEDAMAGE callback
Any idea why trying to access a return false
I'll fix that later.
if multiple files require the same file it doesn't catch that but that might be above my paygrade :p
Alright, I've got it *basically* working
prob
i want to write it in python but it'd probably be better to make it in lua tbh
that would sound good to me if I weren't sticking with antibirth at least
basically it would let you use require then "compile" your mod into one file with all of the requirements turning into inline code
In the same way node-browserify does?
Would y'all be interested in a tool that "reimplements" require?
god knows
there any way to spawn an item from a specific pool or do I have to make my own?
i'm gonna be lazy for a bit then come back to it
who knows
Maybe it's the anm2 file that's wrong
this wouldn't be it but 1 sec
wait
i might be dumb
still not rendering
eh, nope
it must default to false
that makes sense
oh
one sec
whoops
oh it does?
that's just an existing one, lol
i like the name of that animation file
The only thing I see is that `Sprite:Load()` expects 2 arguments.
(I haven't messed with sprites at all before)
Am I missing something stupid?
```lua
TSoI.tree.bg_sprite = Sprite()
TSoI.tree.bg_sprite:Load('gfx/fuckall.anm2')
```
and
```lua
function TSoI:post_render()
  TSoI.tree.bg_sprite:Render(TSoI.tree.top_left, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
end

[...]

TSoI:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, TSoI.post_render )
```
Ok, so I'm actually having trouble rendering sprites to screen
or existent
rip
as you know, the api documentation isn't very good
oh
it's in both actually but i'm not picky
Yeah it's definitely quite misleading
w/e
It's in the same area as Game
but ok
it is in the docs...
yeah, it's not a global function
Isn't it `Isaac.WorldToRenderPosition`?
excuse me
```
[INFO] - ERR: .../share//binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/build/main.lua:26: attempt to call a nil value (global 'WorldToRenderPosition')
```
Does `EntityPickup.Price` actually change price? Or is it just visuals?
it seems like
So, top left is always ingame coords
no clue, sorry
anyone figured out costume altcolours?
as far as I can tell it only looks for them in the game's root directory, not your mod folder, but maybe someone got it working
also time for my computer to groan with steam open
uuugh
i'm about to
no idea, you'll have to test that
Also is GetTopLeftPos always 0,0, or is it in screen coords ???
I guess i'll do shitty math let's go boys
Nicalis Pls
uuuuuuuugh
what about big rooms
fuck
but wait
with GetTopLeftPos and GetBottomRightPos?
I guess I'll just render based on the room
I'm still holding out hope for finding something that's just tucked away somewhere weird
Thanks for the great api gaben
fuckkk
...theoretically with some math I should be able to get the room info and do some shitty wrapping but
I'm looking through the docs and I can't find it
Please god tell me I can
I swear to the good lord if I can't
Also, how do I get size of screen in screen coordinates?
I know, but blegh
i mean, making a blank image should take like 5 seconds anyway
I'm just gonna make a blank image
i'm not even going to try it tbh
Because I need to create a "placeholder" item to access the use item button for the mod i'm working on
Anyone know if creating an item without an image works or if it needs a blank image
just a variable
not a function
lmao
Player.Damage
i cant find one in the docs
is there a get function for the players damage?
seeya
good night xD
you've got plenty of time on other days though!
so maybe not
and i have work tomorrow
though it's now 2:15am
yeah haha
always good to overdeliver
haha
At first I wanted this pica paint item to be a small bit of fun
splosion:GetSprite().Scale = Vector((entities[i].Mass + 40) / 100, (entities[i].Mass + 50) / 100);
cool
I'm finalising it
that size isn't bad for a boss though I think
yeah xD
funny though that it goes off at the moment he dies rather than at the end of his death animation and then after that it plays his old one
If the height is basically 2/3-1/2 of that veritcally, it seems ok
http://gfycat.com/SleepyShadyCowbird
just focus on the width
ignore the height here
oh btw
not sure since I don't know what kind of masses things tend to have
or just put a cap on it
if bosses tend to have way higher masses,
you could also have a separate algorithm for enemies and bosses
yes in theory
which seems good
and monstro will be 1.2
that means flies will be 0.46
gonna put it to (mass+20)/50
there may need to be a form of diminishing returns
lol
monstro's explosion was HUGE
try it
+10 /25 then?
maybe flies should be a little smaller though
yeah you might be able to achieve something reasonable with that
*6x
meaning flies will be the same size as they are now, but monstro will be 3x larger
so maybe (Mass + 10)/20?
I want a 'smallest'
considering the scale is at 0.5,0.5 atm, what do you think
monstro is 50.0
mullibooms have 6.0
Black flies have mass 3.0
also mass does seem to be in the game
LOL I also just realised that every enemy also shoots coloured projectiles
spawn a couple enemies and splatterthem
i'll check
hmm mass might be better than nothing, I'm not sure how well it correlates
but idk
There's a 'mass' one
it's stupid if that's not a feature nicalis added but it wouldn't surprise me
that'd be smart
you could scale the splash size based on that if so
why/
doubtful
can you get their collision radius stat from the api?
and only when you have the item of course
yeah
the animation only plays when something dies right?
I think this one's good
still fan of 1 but ok
hmm
but I love the animation for sure
3 is best
Not sure if they could be a tiny bit larger or smaller
That's good
Third one:
http://gfycat.com/HarmoniousFragrantGoldeneye
Wait for this tho Cake
1 looks good that way
I got him to 0 hearts yet he isn't ded
agreed 1 is better
How do I make Isaac die using commands?
Hey guys, question
great!
it looks amazing
holy shit
ah, its a vector
o
no clue, I don't do ab+
how do I set that? ?
GetSprite().Scale
it does look nice it's just too much for regular tears
if not then maybe put that on bombs and give them creep as well
yeah idk, if you can that would be good
Maybe i can change size?
could you keep them but make them smaller?
I think the splashes are a too intense in the second one
colors look a lot better
Which is best? I'm trying to make a mod pack not an individual mod, so i don't want it to be over the top
Option two:
http://gfycat.com/ForcefulDependableKomododragon
Option one:
http://gfycat.com/DamagedHandyAmberpenshell
pick wisely
for what the final product will look like
Here's two options
Okay
they aaaarrrr
make the creep a slow/gluey creep like Ball of Tar
gushers are delicious
I still think you should roll with what I said
gushers yeah
Gush eh? ?
or I can make them gush everywhere
and in that it only slows enemies down
I can either do a small explosion the same size as the tear explosion
just make sure the creep doesn't damage you
well
so that effect is the best you are going to get
though, paint and primer in one does legit look like that when it spills
oh yeah lol
all the creep being splatted around it literally looks like a gushers commercial
I'm talking about in the gif
no I mean
No good effects for it really
and instead of firing tears from his eyes, isaac fires blood from his mouth
It also does not effect your speed
the difference between CANDY and Dangerous Candy is that, Dangerous candy doesn't give you sugar crash but it  is an hp down and a damage up
but yeah
"Filled with juice"
Instead of whatever you have it should be gushers
OH I JUST GOT AN IDEA
to coincide
enjoy
http://gfycat.com/ScratchyCluelessAxisdeer
see if I can make up a costume
I need an actual effect to color when i get it done haha
I'm gonna cue up that tutorial on how to make a passive item mod in isaac
doggo likes those
oh pretty colors
but its fun to see the colours
so obviously this won't be the finished product
Ok
it happens less if your luck stat is up
and your range shits out
and when that happens your speed is nerfed like a motherfucker for one room
but, every now and then you go on a sugar crash
the CANDY mod basically super buffs your speed and damage
well
it made the colours much better
someone likes their candy
because it doesn't have any LUA Coding yet nor does it have sprite or that sort of info
you were damn right melon
would cause the entire game to not want to start
"starving pupper" "CANDY" and Dangerous Candy
The XML file from my incomplete mod
SO I found out what was fucking it up..
ehh it's not that much
but that's alot of storing
looking good so far though
I wish
ohhhhhhhhhhh
it would also be cool if you could match the creep tint to the tear tint
I'm gonna do what melon said
nah just the plaint effect
oh u had the same idea as me <@110125570452398080>
splatoon mod wut who said that
kinda reminds me of splatoon
gonna try messing with it
looks pretty cool
<@219159380094877696> thats AWESOME
ah
i can change that easily haha
I took one piece of damage cos one of the things the tears explode into is enemy creep
it looks like you're taking damage from it?
pick one to be 255, another to be randomly 255 or 0, and the third to be random between 0 and 255
for best results I would say..
if you make it so that at least one of the colors (red green or blue) is always 255 then it will look nicer
would I be able to change any of those numbers to make it more pronounced colours?
I knew it could be done haha
```Lua
local splosion = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.BLOOD_EXPLOSION, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player); 
        splosion:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255)); 
        splosion:GetSprite():Update();
```
what is your code to pick a random color?
http://gfycat.com/SoupyHomelyAbyssiniancat
And my newest update to it:
http://gfycat.com/WelltodoBaggyGuanaco
Hope you love this ;D
(looks around) ellow modders yo XD love what i been seeing form u guys
gif time
Glad it works though ?
```Lua
local splosion = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.LARGE_BLOOD_EXPLOSION, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player); 
        splosion:GetSprite().Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 255); 
        splosion:GetSprite():Update();
```
to colour it:
And it still fucks my ass about it
i went overboard though
But this is the second time I've re installed Afterbirth Plus
LOL
IT WORKS
in Isaac Mod Exe's , which is on my desktop
because, I installed antibirth in another folder
this is annoying
I can see the creep flashing blue
let me check the rebirth resources folder
Of isaac? not sure.
does antibirth put things in the resources folder?
and I have no idea as to why
Apparently Antibirth seriously cannot coexist with AB+ whatsoever
but ONLY afterbirth
So, turns out Afterbirth works
ugh jesus I feel like Cartman from south park throwing a shit fit
It doesn't have any parameters though lol
nice one
Entity expected, got table???
Oh i wasn't calling update right?
it just doesn't update the existing sprite?
so it does set it
as it starts disappearing
it tints the creep they leave blue
...
oh hang on
trying it with sprite now
but nothin there
i'm also doing splosion:Update() after color setting
so it does set it
for the BO
I pass it through a debugstring and it outputs 1.0 now
well
doing that there ^ doesn't set the values right
local splosion = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.CREEP_WHITE, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player); splosion.Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1, 255, 255, 255) end
maybe try entity:GetSprite().Color?
I discoevered something though
hmm
I've tried putting the offsets up too
OR, OG, and OB are addition, and will be added to the color (0-255)
R,G,B, and A are multipliers, and will multiply the color by that value (0-1)
Always get an 'attempt to index a nil value' for it
Doesn't seem to
does Entity:SetColor() not work?
Trying all sorts of fancy stuff, but it doesn't seem to color them haha
```Lua
local splosion = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.CRACK_THE_SKY, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player) 
          splosion.Color.G = 1; splosion.Color.B = 1; splosion.Color.G = 1; splosion.Color.A = 1; splosion.Color:SetTint(0, 1.0, 0, 1);
```
seems I can't do that haha
attempt to call a nil value (method 'SetTint')
?
'attempt to call a nil value (field 'SetColorize')'
sorry!
oh, dang
it's not an api mod so it wouldn't really do you any good
Just interested as to how you made the bones coloured and fly out of them like that
I obviously won't copy it or put it in my mod
Would you be willing to provide me with the source code so I can see how you did it?
reminds me of the confetti ammo from terraria
kinda reminds of 'silly gibs'
ooooh, that's smart ?
made them bright white and tinted
custom made?
How did you color all the chunks differently
ah didn't know you saw it
haha yeah reminded me of that
<@219159380094877696>
https://gfycat.com/FlippantUnfoldedCatbird
I found GetColor() exists, so I guess I could print the result in the console.
If I could get the color of slowed enemies I think it could work?
The thing I'm working on is a challenge that makes Isaac blindfolded but he's given a night light that damages enemies
I'm not sure if all slowed enemies move at the same speed, but one idea I have is the color of the enemy
sweet ^^
Pica Paint 2.0 ?
https://gfycat.com/ShortWhisperedGnat
and check if their movespeed goes down...?
i guess you can track all entities
i know you can :AddSlowing() to an entitynpc
hmm
Simple question: How to I check to see if an enemy is slowed
this turned out 5x better than i expected
Oh my god
Okay I can chat now
cya!
i'm off, bye ?
but that's a whole new level
now if only I could color the creep the same as the tear
...oh.
you wrote Entity_Tear before
entities[i].Type == 2 works but entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR doesn't work?
`e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR`
wait what XD
it's ENTITY_TEAR that's why :p
well
why does it work with 2? xD
this is lua
~=
works with 2
EntityType.Entity_Tear != 2
Yeah no about to head over
hmm
Still can't get that tear explosion thing to work
seriously, there are definetly plenty of people over at <#267353315073982465> that would love to help ^^
The coding's the easy bit
My weaknesses are planning and spriting :p
id help building stuff, but spriting is not for me ^^
works for me :p
oh god then no. Go over to <#267353315073982465> xD
would be helpful
i just tried it, doesn't seem to work :c
But also someone who can help build the skill trees for different characters
entities[i].Position instead of player.Position but yeah it works
I mostly would need a spriter I guess now that I think about it
id love to ^^
Guys, in all seriousness, anyone want to work with me on this character build based mod? I'm actually getting really addicted to this idea
would that sort of thing work then?
```Lua
elseif entities[i].Type == EntityType.Entity_Tear and entities[i]:IsDead() then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_GREEN, 0, player.Position, Vector(0,0), player)
```
works <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
```-- ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE
local ee = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
for i=1, #ee do
    local e = ee[i]
    if e.Type == 2  then
        if e:IsDead() then
            -- whatever
        end
    end
end```
that's the question
are tears included in on_npc_update
So, get all the entities in a room on POST_UPDATE, if they're a tear that's dead, create a splat?
Probably
^
really?
probably tear:IsDead() would work !
You... should be able to detect that, right?
ty ^_^
your revive item is cool btw!
so I could make my Pica Paint item paint the ground
I wish there was an easy way to check when a tear hit the ground
true that
you think antibirth was made with this api ? lol
dang lol
that's a whole different universe tbh
oh
and it just didn't read
in contents
then how'd they make antibirth's floors
I tried to add a floor in stages.xml
It isn't I don't believe
it is probably possible, but jesus not easy
yeah
(when it's possible to make floors I guess)
and that sounds epic
haha
made use of the ultra greed sounds
it turn them into a dollar and destroys the item
I was thinking of making a black market floor like in spelunkey actually
and if you use it with < 3, placenta, magic scab, bob's brain in the room
turns hearts into money, soul hearts/black/eternal give more money
Active item, 4 recharge
my other favourite item is black market
lets you hold out
the ones that don't spawn things
yeah
the jar is for bosses though
maybe enemies have 1/2 or 1/3 chance to spawn hearts
actually no, the hush gapers
well, except with bosses i guess
hmm
up until you get to hush
Although all enemies dropping half-hearts seems to make it pretty easy
No, yeah, you've actually got some pretty brilliant ideas going on
and all enemies will drop half hearts
he'll lose health every 15-20 seconds, and starts with jar of hearts
Nice idea BTW Maddogs!
My character idea, is a vampire character, who needs to eat hearts to survive
cya
Anyway I'm going to bed so if someone  knows, PM me ! Bye everyone!
but people will probably hate it haha
i have a wacky idea for a character too
dude. youve got some cool idaes!
planning on making one where isaac becomes a zombie and has to eat three enemies before he decomposes
and yeah, that looks rad
cya
so I'm gonna have to stick with crack the sky
cya ^^
I want to have the light from cathedral opening, but sadly it won't work properly with the spriting
thanks ^_^
bye!
Cool!
Oh nice. That looks really cool, actually
With which function/attribute ?
(laggy) My first revival-style item:
https://gyazo.com/c6f8b0933fb988a79368d7da535156b9
can't you just edit the health
it's weird
Yep
oh yeah it makes the other hearts black
The other option is to TakeDamage but I don't want the anim nor the sound
I thought I was smart for a second
nvm
oh huh
Yeah
^^^
well -2 is two half hearts though right
I didn't find anything else
And your first clue waaaaas (loud drumroll please)
I have a problem?
what a joke if so
is that how removing soul/black hearts works
lol of course
lol what
You have a problem...
AddBlackHearts(-2)
removing? so how is this related to addblackhearts?
Mentalist... mate..
But if for example you have 1001 1101 (1 for soul hearts and 0 fo black), i need to remove 1 soul, then 1 black, then 1 soul
and yes, I hate myself just as much as you do for making that joke.
I'm sorry all of you had to see that.
-cut to someone furiously masterbating in a school library-
I bring my laptop with me every day for entertainment purposes.
again, i can just pause it until I get to school tomarrow
i tried addblackhearts SLiost it works as excpected ?
I guess that could work but honestly I'm not sure
I seriously do hope it decides to pick option A
just let it download in the night
isaac was confirmed for the switch
same here Mentalist at 100
Hi ! Does someone know if EntityPlayer::AddBlackHearts is broken in any way ? I'm trying to remove the last 3 hearts of the player (black or soul ones) and it never removes the right one. Any idea ?
OR, Until the download decides to shit it's pants and corrupt the game
what's the problem <@249974366106943489> ?
I.E. I'm stuck like this all god damned day until the fucker decides to reinstall
and currently I shit you not, I am topping out at around 70 KB/s
Isaac and Afterbirth are 500 megabytes together
Also, to give you an idea of how shitty my internet problems are
Nobody knows ? :/
I really do need to watch a tutorial, but I can't.
_sitting here casually pretending that I know what the fuck everyone's talking about_
ok. thank you
lmao Jean
sort of the thing with Consts
but not edit them
You can read them
Shouldn't be, no
btw where is Isaac MMO
Well. Some attributes in EntityTear are const, and i want to access them. is that somewhat possible?
um, consts aren't a thing in lua if that's what you mean I guess
Anythings possible with the right attitude and enough lube
what
Remove items, make isaac XP and build-based?
<@96016391173332992> is it possible to cast const away in lua...?
It seems fun.
because nintendo needs third party support and/or an actually fucking mature game like metroid to come back
Also, I think I'm starting to really think about this mod idea I got from the suggestion thread
Whether nintendo likes it or not
If it came to the 3DS it can come to the switch
but noo it has to be a disgusting taunt emoji
I use :p to signify that I'm either being a dumbass or I simply don't know
Doubtful? :p
also, damn it discord emojis
I wonder if isaac is coming to the switch
hmm..
not sure
uhhhhh
?
Hi ! Does someone know if EntityPlayer::AddBlackHearts is broken in any way ? I'm trying to remove the last 3 hearts of the player (black or soul ones) and it never removes the right one. Any idea ?
soo yeah
As it sits, because the communication between the internship program and my school is worse than communication during the development of sonic 06, I'm still stuck like a fucking rat in the library with jack shit to do
soo yeah
said internship gives me 7monies and hour to a lump sum I get at the end of the semester, and 8 monies an hour to my pocket
Trying for an internship, which is why I dropped the rest of my day
I still have to fucking fight for and I can't get a job
if you're like me, stuff that you are typically given by your parents (ID, SSID card, Birth cirtificate)
you're only really supposed to do it when you get a job but
because I have enough credits to get out early
I get off of school at 2:00 my time exact
I'm a senior and, in that
and then install it
if it becomes a fucking network problem I'll just fucking wait until I get back in school
doin it now
alright
do that then let it reinstall
Yeah
gimme a sec...
oh, no I didn't
what I'm doing now is installing one-
you deleted local files?
sooo
What I did notice is that all of this network shit kinda comes and goes with weather condition
weird
just, not abp after I "reinstalled it"
Rebirth launches
wellll
reinstall every time
nah don't be a pussy
w/e
Local files
this time install antibirth in a different folder
and reinstall
Delete game cache or whatever it's called
and after I re installed the DLC's, it's refusing to launch
and I am re installing my dlcs
I have it installed
but like
I know
if that's what you're talking about
you have to downgrade to rebirth to install Antibirth
Erm
for some reason Afterbirth Plus is literally refusing to launch
is anyone willing to answer my question from antibirth support?
shot speed is how fast the shots go
oh and
fire rate is how long in between shots
Should I actually put in lua scripting for the fakemon for the fangame?
It can be really fuzzy and I always confuse the two
lets give it a try! hoorey! ill come back with results
yeaaah the difference between tears (fire rate) and shot speed is
yeah thats what i thought
and shot speed is velocity i believe ofc
Yeah range is mostly shot height
oh ok :p
Range is affected by Height and velocity, which both are adjustable. should work ^^ <@229593818691928067>
oh pink trinagles...
 ill stick with my cyan circles
Kappa
You can usually find one there
Mate just go to the item room
I has question, how do you find items?
but then idk how to change Range on an EntityTear sso they would be that of the player...
that's gay
<@109624258317033472> i think, that will work
sprites are for nabs. ill stick with my pink triangles forever ?
Kappa
call it 
">implying this is Pokemon"
Scayze if you remove the Tearflags maybe??
make it """pokemon""" instead
but god damni its buggy
I got a sprite into the game
I'm shite at it
Right Maddogs? I hate spriting
but
It's not gonna be actual "Pokemon" because I'll get sued
screw spriting ._.
trash it up!
if i fire a tear from an entity, not the player, using player:FireTear and set Parent and SpawnerEntity to nil. should that work wihtout interferring with the Players items like Dead Eye?
And I'm trying to figure out if I should mod or start working on the "pokemon" fangame project I'm wanting to do because I'm a trash person
and planning
To be fair the mod i'm gonna work on needs a decent bit of brainpower
dead right now
ugggh i need to get programming but my head is like
hundreds
I honestly don't know how many languages N++ has
Thanks , Jean btdubs
as say, if you have negative/shit luck
If you have increased luck it will not happen nearly as often
pretty good
slow as fuck and you're tired.
Gives you a massive speed and strength boost but one time it will randomly prock a "sugar crash"
"WOOOO CANDY!"
I actually just finished the xml file for an experimental item called CANDY!!!
That's really nice
Oh, it comes with Lua
to my gran, emails are magic indeed!
lemme check notepad ++
you don't need zerobrane though
emails aren't magic
Shit.
at least that's how I think it works and I very well could be a fucking wiz at this point.
what
wouldn't help. still downloading files
I'm getting it from Google's clientside, which will fuck me over quite a lot less
because I'm not getting it from ZeroBrane's server
why
then it might work
as in the files, and not a link
I'm thinking if someone emailed me the zip file/exe for ZeroBrane studios and/or the isaac plugin
well
you have so many problems man i'm not sur how to help
Id love to use vim, it looks so cool. But im definetly not going to learn how.
if you see my shit in <#260932688209379338>
That actually might also be why I can't fucking access Afterbirth
^
which we are
unless you're crazy
I bought on new years day, and started fucking red lining/dying out on me a fucking week later
lol yeah don't actually use vim
I'm gonna assume it's my shitty modem, which if you don't know
don't complicate it use a normal editor
vim best
after 3 megs out of 6
:p
But it shits out
I use vim ?
youre a fucking monster, transit
because ZeroBrane auto compiles to isaac
as you can add the API interpreter
I tried getting ZeroBrane
use vim like a real person
you can use ZeroBrane Studio
not really, though zerobrane is nice
just use notepad++ or sublime for that
Are you really a mentalist I have to ask
you dont need no IDE for lua
which tools can you not access
it shits out at 3 megs out of 6
oh
like, I tried to get an IDE for LUA but for some reason either it's my network or the server I'm getting it from
you may need to export the files first
I am trying to make a few mods myself but for some reason I can't access any of the fucking tools
Well, my animation spawns, but doesn't 'play' xD
I need a little bit of help
^^
except that i know how it works afterwards and dont ave to google it again
guys
thats litterally how i do math
is that how you do math "google it or smth" lol
google get vector intersection wall or smth
but you should probably be able to figure it out i guess
'll try and do the math if you want
i
indeed not.
nice
that makes no sense
https://streamable.com/gatrb
oh
but how would that work with two lasers?
ok well i know Room:GetLaserTarget works ^^
doesnt work for rotations or what?
it works incorrectly
xD
i don't want to get the math but it should be possible
no
yes
btw does GetEndPoint work ?
just get the pos where it hits the wall i guess?
is there a way to spawn something at the end of brimstone rotated 45°?
and use heaven.heaven_sprite()
ty
```lua
if heaven.heaven_sprite ~= nil then
  heaven.heaven_sprite = Sprite()
end
```
config["XPosition"]+2?
does nothing / crashes the game for me
yo transit, have you randomly figured out EntityNPC FireProjectile?
so this is where you need to convert from world coords to screen coords i guess
```
                sprite:Load("gfx/cardfronts.anm2", true)
                sprite:Play("Idle")
                sprite:Update()
                sprite:Render(Vector(config["XPosition"]+2,config["YPosition"]+12), Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
```
that's gonna use up a lot of memory
don't create the sprite again everytime
i've never used sprites yet because i'm too lazy to start coding
```Lua

function madPack:martyr_render()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if martyrEffect then
    local heaven = Sprite();
    heaven:Load("gfx/effects/heaven.anm2", true);
    heaven:Render(player.Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0));
  end
end

madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, madPack.martyr_render);```
nice
but it doesn't load the sprite
Well, I have no errors so it seems to like it
even though it technically works
some people use heaven.Load(heaven, <args>) but they're wrong
because that's how it gets the "self" variable
basically, if the function deals with the internals of the class you gotta use : instead of .
no errors but no sprite either, darn haha
oh of course
not heaven.Load
heaven:Load
```heaven.Load("gfx/effects/heaven.anm2", true);```
maddogs
probably LoadGraphics ?
'bad argument 1 to 'Load' (Sprite expected, got string)
wat
<@96016391173332992> bonus point from me if you can figure out how the game uses the 005.100_collectible.anm2 (Only includes spritesheet for sad onion but works for every item ingame)
i haven't messed with lua in a couple of days
"new" isnt a thing in lua, afaik
i don't really remember
or is it Sprite.Sprite()
right?
local heaven = Sprite() i think
idk what
for something
also it'd be fun to make programmatically generated anm2s
Because i'd totally create a "class" for PngSprite that would just load straight from a png
guessing its not as simple as ```local heaven = new Sprite;```
How do I just render a new sprite from nothing
... why tho?
like, not a filepath but a generated anm2 file
I wish there was a way to load anm2s with text
kk. Just sayin because someone yesterday tried to work out how to convert them, because he didnt know that method existed xD spent hours
I know
theres a function for converting them
figured
screen cords
I mean sure. Do sprites render with screen coord or world coords
<@96016391173332992> 
```Can you make a tutorial on how to Render sprites at Specific Locations? like Player Position or at the Bottom Center etc.?```
So just a tutorial on how to render existing / non existing things, how to define specific locations and thats it ?
not for me <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
?
it's like trying to decode chinese memes
sounds like some sort of meme
russian shitposting
xD
> to the peasants
kek
the last comment is russian proverb, but every noun is replaced with isaac
/s
I might be willing I guess. For someone that's pushed the API like I have I've given surprisingly little to the peasants
^
what is it ?
<@229593818691928067> no
does Wofsauge mean "Sausage made of wolfmeat" in another language ?
anyone interested in making a tutorial (reddit thread) about rendering sprites ? i got some requests for that but dont have time right now
RoboBaby, what the fuck xD
ayo
hi
hey
peace
further proof that linux is superior Kappa
hi guys
cheers
^
forward slashes
then it tells me 'invalid escape sequence'
""
I tried that
put it in "quotes" :p
heaven.Load(gfx\effects\heaven.anm2, true);
How do I format the filename for loading a sprite?
????? is Isaac
is the last one Isaac in russian ?
wait a sec
lol
ahaha
what do those comments mean ?
anyway, thanks a lot ? now i can die in peace
just no one in russia writes like he
haha
and wheres that "ear" coming from? xD
'invalid escape sequence near '"\g''
nice!
he wrote
i am dumb
dude
oh
but without space
yeah, there is word nice and word ear
you can? ?
at least i can see the word nice
But data storage is also my weakness so
Also I definitely want to create something to efficiently save and load both per-run data and persistent data from tables using Mod:SaveData and Mod:LoadData
lol
thought so. ^^
that is random russian letters
damn. its really infuriating when someone comments on your workshop item, in a language hat even Google Translate cant translate. What the fuck is: ???????
I love it
holy crap
Thank minichibis for tetris piece sprites! http://i.imgur.com/XFAG2wI.png
For those who haven't seen it
like... health plus damage or something idk
Oh, and as a last thing before I go
do enemies have any values i could realistically treat as xp without adding it manually to every enemy?
bye
cya
cy'all
You can figure it out, I'll be off
And finally put the image in the frame
good easter egg imo
yeah
oh the easter egg?
insert frame
add layer
variations of what?
create animation
add spritesheet
You have to make new file
but w/e
<@219159380094877696> That's because you add the png as a spritesheet
honestly everybody disagrees with me lmao
Yeah, have you seen all the variations jer?
But you can't open non-anm2 files in the animation editor? xD
:D
i disagree <@96016391173332992> lol
rip
fun
yeah but the anm2 editor has an easter egg
but it's more fun to do it manually anyway :p
lol
:p
gotta do everything manually
runs in wine lol
I'll murder you if I see this in an actual mod
on linux you mean?
tfw no animation editor on linux
And don't you dare run these three lines of code in the render callback
Create an anm2 out of the png with the Animation Editor tool
^
No, `Render` is supposed to be in a callback and it has to be an anm2
<@219159380094877696>
Nah mate it has to be an anm2 file
¯\_(?)_/¯
Yeah but I don't really care much about antibirth api :p
<@126590786945941504> something like this:
```Lua
local heaven = new Sprite();
      heaven.Load("\gfx\effects\heaven.png", true);
      heaven:Render(player.Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0));
```
(antibirth api has full input detection ? )
or something
Easy enough anyway, just temporarily swap their spacebar item with one that'll give a "confirm" input
gay imo
Eh, fair enough
thats all :c
from joy and keybord
only shoot and move inputs
nop.
Prolly not
GetMovementJoystick and GetShootingJoystick
can we get other input? :p
Fair enough
<@96016391173332992> We always could've gotten WASD/arrow keys input AFAIK
I assume so in at least some way given the Tetris WIP
<@96016391173332992> yep
You can also render the same sprite however many times you want in that callback
Also can we get input now?
<@219159380094877696> If you want it to be drawn every frame and on top of anything else in the game, yes
You'd have to specifically deep clone
<@126590786945941504> do you HAVE to do the render in a postrender callback?
Because Lua tables can't be passed by value, I mean
idk
It's just a Lua table
it doesnt even say it returns a ref
that seems fun
I use it in my Rock Bombs
anyway i'm tired of working on that one so I'm making this new one. Thinking I might have active items charge with mana potions instead or something?
Yes, there is GetData
lol
<@229593818691928067> holy shit if that works im gonna lick your balls. i was desperate for that feature.
<@219159380094877696> You should put `true` as a second argument to `Load` and you need to run `Render` in a POST_RENDER callback
shrug
But instead everything has to be micromanaged and saved within the mod context
Oh, yeah, that'll probably be added in the future
you should just be able to make it an EntityPickup and have a callback on pickup.
the rest is good tho?
It's not shit. It's just shit you've got to pull to load to create a custom pickup
<@219159380094877696> The path to the anm2 file relative to your mod's resource folder
I think he means like he keeps variables organized with tables
Did you expect to type in `Game():DoMyMod("kill all nips on custom item use")`?
KubeRoot, hate to be a pain, but how do I load a custom sprite, then render it in the game?

something like 
```Lua
local test = new Sprite()
test:Load(idk what to put here)
test:Render(player.Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
```
??
someone said it returns a table that you can edit
Also, I don't know what does your mod do, but it doesn't look like "shit"
:p
Look I didn't come here to be criticized, fam.
there is?
isn't there GetData ?
to store a own table
we really need some userdata member in Entity
That doesn't "clutter the global namespace"
Just use `local`
It just makes sense to me. Don't clutter the global namespace
Any variable I wanted stored I wanted to keep within the table
<@96016391173332992> Why did you put every variable as a field on the mod table?
?
what the fuck
and I can just call that randomly?
Well, `Sprite:Render(Position, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))` if you just want basic rendering
that bullshit
https://ptpb.pw/IvdV.lua/lua
i mean render it somewhere
A sprite is just visuals
You can't "spawn" a sprite
KubeRoot, how do I get my own sprite and spawn it into the game randomly?
I'll show you one second
What "bullshit"?
probably not. I dont think there was anything new in that area...
?
Is it possible to add custom collectibles yet without doing the bullshit I did?
yeah, beeing hacky is somewaht annoying, but really fun too ^^
also, there are custom curses, with an own callback
Good. It's only fun that way :p
youre still required to be hacky ^^
besides of that. Nothing too exciting. some small methods and desciptions.
that is cool.
Oh nice
so thats cool
well. Theres a EntityTear now
I'm wanting to do one of the mod requests that has XP and a skill tree, replacing items. Because that seems fun I guess idk
that's what I'm trying to remember
(also how do I draw a sprite to the screen I can't remember)
Did I miss any major developments?
Took my break time to do stupid bullshit again
Aight guys I'm back to modding.
Hmm, how do you just add a sprite to the game again?
I think
but i can't spawn it without also providing a way to go up to the next floor
is perfect for my item
The effect for the light ray to go up to the cathedral
Damn
this looks nice
oh snap
agree
that Mei character is amazing
hey guys, does someone know how to add a costume to isaacs body when flying? it just cuts the body and shws a flying head, lel
AB+ mods (that I modded) don't work for some reason. I've done everything right, but when I start the game, it doesn't load the modded files. Guess i'll just finish my AB mod first.
shame there's no way to spawn effects like a hush laser without them actually behaving like a hush laser
yeah
160 h in 1 week
now i have 240
no idea now
I had like 290
1 week ago i had 80 h in isaac
Nice (Y)
naisu
Just made an item that upon taking fatal damage, gives you a heart, cracks the sky and turns you into an angel
haha I probably will too
I just noticed I passed 1000 hours of Isaac this week... Many of those most recent hours are, without a doubt, hours spent testing & debugging mods XD
sadly, AddEternalHearts() doesn't seem to
nice, it worked ?
now I'm trying to add fancy effects etc
I figured it out
If you have multiple CBs, you may have added martyr_effect to a different callback by accident.
and the functions are IDENTICAL
i didn't get these problems with the other item
now it says 'attempt to perform arithmetic on a userdata value (local 'dmg')'
from what I can tell
```madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, madPack.martyr_effect, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER);```
u need something in the ()
._.?
but not on this one
and it worked on an earlier item
Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
thought it'd be easier to grab the damaged entity
why not just get player?
```Lua
function madPack:broken_hearted_trigger(dmg_entity, dmg)
  local player = dmg_entity:ToPlayer()
``` 
runs fine with no errors, but
```Lua
function madPack.martyr_effect(dmg_entity, dmg)
  local player = dmg_entity:ToPlayer();
```
errors saying 220: attempt to call a nil value (method 'ToPlayer')
ok, sorry
oh
not the third param, but as a return value
third param
in the callback
...the heck?
Don't forget to return TRUE so the game *actually* applies the damage.
ok
oh
you have to subtract the damage
beacuse it gets the hearts before the damage is dealt
why not just do ``local health = player:GetHearts()``
i had it there due to copying the start of the function from another item i made
it's the damage dealt on the callback
dmg
so, why u use
oh i see why again
Still doesn't work
```Lua
function madPack.martyr_effect(dmg_entity, dmg)
  local player = dmg_Entity:ToPlayer();
  if player:HasCollectible(martyr) then
    local health = player:GetHearts() - dmg;
    if health <= 0 then
      madPack.playSound(SoundEffect.SOUND_HOLY, 1.0, 1.0);
```
Code is now:
it wasn't before
Meant to be passed through from the parameters/argumentrs
dmg
what is `` local health = player:GetHearts() - dmg;``?
ok then
xD
im dumb
hitting exactly zero is rare
oh wiat
doesn't trigger any of the effects after the if statement
do <=
```Lua
function madPack.martyr_effect()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(martyr) then
    local health = player:GetHearts() - dmg;
    if health == 0 then
```
and this:
I have the callback on damage
hm.
then compare damage to players helath
beacuse it seems that you die instantly, before the callback is done...?
probably in the take damage callback
yeah
so before you die?
ehh.
How to make something trigger when you take fatal damage...
thx
which familiar appears on the head or smthin?
sweet.
naisu
it works like default brim
so
if you charge brim and then after firirng press shoot button it disappears
okay, got my arch halo familiar sprite
no, i was just showing that it works like brimstone
looks quite cool ^^ even tho a llittle buggy. it seems like he instantly disappears instead of getting smaller sometimes
Holy brimstone
damage = damage * 2 + 0.5
tear delay = tear delay * 3
fires two powerful beams of light(Fully copies brimstone behavior)
TO DO LIST:
-need a sprite
-wait for nicalis to update api and then make brim pass through walls
https://streamable.com/5pzap
it really didn't seem to like that Jean ?
player.Range doesn't exist
also I can't seem to find the range modifier for a player
oh, cheers ?
`tear.TearFlags = 1<<2`
I want to make an item where standing still gives homing tears
Does anyone know how to make tears homing btw?
i already removed all my code ._.
actually you can change its subtype after spawning it and it stays open
is there a way to 'wait' btw?
bleh
removed my fancy exploding items and just made it spawn chests
yeah
>_>
when you spawn a chest with subtype 0 however, it turns into a subtype 1
Maddogs, it looks like Closed is subtype 1 and Opened is 0
okay, lets familiar this halo then
afterbirth+ is such a dissapointment still
yeah! API is shit!
and nope there isn't
I wrote 60 lines of code for nothing >_>
hmm is there srsly no call back to just detect if the player picks up an item? or something like that?
<@195368190333812736> detect the bomb and replace it with your custom
dropping an opened chest and throwing items everywhere is cooler
Cos it wouldn't make sense for a bomb to just drop a chest
So there's no way to spawn an opened chest?
<@195368190333812736> hi
?
sigh
Funnily enough, spawning a CHEST_CLOSED spawns a closed chest
GetNumBombs ()
Okay so how do I detect if the players bombs went up
i would use a familiar
cuz the anim is important in this
okay so what should I use here, familiar or tear?
guaranteed it's switched up lol
it's probably only used for checking if a chest is opened, not spawning one
try CHEST_CLOSED
because api is bad?
spawns the chest still closed?
```Lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_CHEST, ChestSubType.CHEST_OPENED, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
```
Anyone got any ideas as to why
xD ok then. thanks tho ^^
oh ok well that one crashed my game last time i tried :p
oh sorry. my bad. i meant the EntityNPC FireProjectile method. damn ^^
he has a blindfold on his eyes which he acctually doesnt have, haha
Ughhhhhh still thoroughly annoyed that you can't spawn closed chests
?
`local tear = mallow:FireProjectile(shootDir)`
well Michael Cant shoot
code you send the code snippet? im doing something wrong...
yay two more fully completed items ?
hay <@223869207748542464>
i have Scayze
but easier custom tear
has anyone gotten the EntityFamiliar FireProjectile method to work?
better to use familiar
when not fired
its hard to tell what to use in this situation
custom tear and custom familiar that would be at x,y cords of isaac
maybe
Fuffles maybe make it a familiar ?
so I have to set up a loop with a math.random
you can do it 2 ways
oh
And that means you can't spawn more than one
no, it will be on ur head as a costume, when you fire, the halo flies forward when it reaches its max range, it will come back and return to isaacs head
and?
flies can have a target
AddBlueFlies() has 3 arguments
AddBlueSpider() has one for it's position
wtf
or you want to do it like bobs brain?
if var is 1 isaac will not shoot it, then you will reset var
it will add 1 to var
ur custom tear
of
if a entity is a tear and and has variant
lol
so basically like the boomerang
uhh not to forget when the halo reaches isaac it will be removed
and then make a value that will scan trough every entity
just give custom tear boomerang tear flag
seems okay apart from the boomerang style for me
y
it's ez af
okay my question how I could do it:
               The Arch Halo

         *The Angels Weapon*

Additionally to isaacs Tears, a Halo will be shot out in a boomerang style,
the velocity will be determined by the tears stat,
No more than 1 Arch Halo can be out
it spawns them still closed
weird
```Lua
Isaac.Spawn(...    ...ChestSubType.CHEST_OPENED, ...)
```

doesn't seem to work
look, the flames are not one the end of beams
https://streamable.com/rmwlx
<@223869207748542464> what's the problem ?
Hmm, spawning chests open doesn't seem to work
Entity.CollisionDamage
How can i apply damage and tearflag to a tear entity that i made, the tear does base damage even if player damage is higher
I wondered if the end point was after they travelled through walls or something
ok no I don't
maybe
its a rly complicated one
I know what's wrong
kill me now
now his item
Thanks ^^
<@146600389779783680> dude that design looks sick!
What is wrong with that?
https://streamable.com/rmwlx
```lua
      local SpawnHolyBrimSplahs = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.BLUE_FLAME, 0, HolyBrimBeam:GetEndPoint(), Vector(0,0), HolyBrimBeam)
      local SpawnHolyBrimSplahs2 = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.BLUE_FLAME, 0, HolyBrimBeam2:GetEndPoint(), Vector(0,0), HolyBrimBeam2)```
I haven't done what you're aiming for, sorry
Code I've used for what?
<@219159380094877696> Can you show me the code you've used?
Ayyy
and transform them into the type you want
Fuffles, just check for any new bombs
https://gfycat.com/WelltodoClosedDegu
btw
<@219159380094877696> Can you show me the code you've used?
or is that too strong and it needs to be 2-5 or something
I wonder how they change the bomb type that appears when u press E
How many flies should my bombs spawn? 3-7?
cause bombs could go up from other things, like bombs are key or boom
yeah pyro
oh wait
Why not if bombs went up?
Check all entities in the room, and check if any bombs disappear, and if they do check if bomb count goes up?
Well
So what was it we desided? To check if the players bombs go up?
I now have an if statement that stretches across my screen twice
That's right.
mhm
Yeah, i guessed that
~= is notequals, right?
SubType is for the Pickup spawn
Variant
but idk it's in both
xD
Probably variant
No, i want them to not.
I think Trollbombs might be seperate enemies
For what? You want Troll Bombs to spawn blue flies as well?
its hard to tell
uhh
no clue
should I check for if the bomb subtype is troll, or if the bomb variant is troll
just OBS capture and gifycat it
but my gif recorder takes ages
Im trying to make the gif for u guys
and I also need to check for the bomb variant
that still doesn't check for who put the bomb there though
?
Oh, so IsPLaying works for that? GOOD.
yeah because it works like that
and dmg >.>
```Lua
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP and entities[i]:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode") and entities[i]:GetSprite():GetFrame() == 1 then
```
You need this:
Turns out in order to make bombs spawn flies
like idk how to make anything besides shotspeed
yeah haha
thats not the simpliest
Modding Isaac aint' easy XD
Thanks to the, eh, limitations imposed by the API.
AKA the lack of callbacks, bindings, etc.
mine are simple items, like an item that increases tears and shot speed and makes your tears rainbow colours
you're trying to make a player though
I havent 1 working item yet
has local require been added yet
O.o
and i've already made 10 working items
Modding is ez if you know what to do
I started modding 2 days ago, and have been almost fully busy
it's not hard either xD
Well, it's part of the process. Modding ain't easy. XD
Oh and entity.parent isn't isaac if you placed a bomb
is the guy that made the new run detector on?
>_>
making bombs spawn flies took longer than making an item turn different hearts into different amounts of coins on use, and change certain items into other ones with sound effects.
I wish I had Mei in Antibirth <.<
the simplest idea for a mod took the longest
it finally works
Oh my god
can just make it the player
Why does AddBlueFlies need a target? ._.
POST PERFECT, gg
Mmmh... So, which call goes first, MC_POST_UPDATE or MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE?
the char by himself works
amazing
Mmmh, nah, nvm, that wouldn't work.
Then you need to check that those items are not being grabbed, maybe using ActionTriggers?
oh
is he your pet human ?
he is an Angel from it
Look in the bible
who's michael
uhh how will I make his item work T-T
so the other way is easier, less to account for
the thing is, there's also items that give bombs
cuz I changed his anims
To prevent "Bombs Are Key" shennanigans, make a MC_USE_CARD callback that detects when BRK is used and sets a flag

Then, keep track of the player's bombs on every tick, if the # changes positively between ticks & BRK was not used, spawn a key.
ok michael works, kinda
yeah
probably cause you're trying to use GetFrame on a boolean
oh i'm calling a method of a sprite on a method of a sprite
- Bomb pickup on the ground disappears
    - Player standing very close to it
- Bomb count going up
```if entities[i]:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode"):GetFrame() == 1``` doesn't work
ughh
carefully is the answer
:c
not if you check if the player's bombs went up too
So how do I check if a bombs being picked up?
bomb count going up AND bomb pickup disappearing
easy
just do both at the same time
Alright... first published mod, released. I'm gonna take the rest of the day off from modding, while thinking on how to draw a Magical Girl Stick that feels distinctively Isaac-ish....
~~if only there was a callback for this~~
this is a tricky question ?
what if you reroll a bomb pickup
but then you have to account for d20 etc
you could alternatively check the room for bomb pickups and see if it goes away while you're still in that room
because there are always double bombs
=> 1
wrong thought
no wait
Id rather check =< 1
what if you have one key and use Bombs are keys
check their bomb count for going up by 1?
<@219159380094877696> How would I check if I a player just picked up a bomb then I spawn a key?
you can use . for functions if you pass in the instance as the first parameter too i believe
: is for functions of instances, . is for attributes, and isaac is a namespace and not an instance, so it uses .
ok lets see then
uhh
uhh
nah you're good
or wait
opps I should have used : not .
I was too lazy to add the function
I suppose that would work
```LUA
if player:GetPlayerType() == Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName("Michael") then
        player.CanFly = true
    end

fuffles:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, fuffles.statUpdate);  ```
I think its because items like the Bible can make the player fly for one room, so they want to be able to have things do stuff temporarily through cache
Cache flags aren't necessarily for stats
(and flying is considered a stat i guess)
Cache is a bit weird, it's really only useful for stats
nevermind, disregard
does cache work for everything :P?
yeah, and you could just give them flying in an update callback if you need, but that's less efficient if the other options work
uhh
pretty much like Azazelino
without any items
cuz I need to make my char fly by vanilla
too bad its item exclusive :L
yeah, the docs are really useful ~~despite being mostly uncommented~~
pretty
hmm
You can look at the docs for a list of them all

haha
yup
didnt knjow that was a cache flag
is there cache flying?
then it would be called when it needs to be evaluated?
Shouldn't it work fine if you just give the item the CACHE_FLYING cache flag?
because he likes my peachy butt
._.
why did robo baby eggplant that
hmm
you can also just give them a flight item
but it's per room, so you'd need to call it constantly
entityplayer has a .CanFly
stupid question, how do I make my char fly >.>?
That sort of thing
```Lua

function madPack.fly_bombs_effect()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(flyBombs) then
    if flyBombsAdded == 0 then
      player:AddBombs(5);
      flyBombsAdded = 1;
    end
```
You can do what I mentioned, it works for me
yeah, that'd work
there's no callback for an item being picked up, might have to do some funky stuff
an then set global variable to true
if they suddenly have it and the global variable = false, do the function
and have a global variable for that item
I just do a check on post_update for if the player has that item
so i just iterated through and checked
Anyone know how I can activate a function when I pickup an item?
same haha
i'm not super used to lua
like 'contains' in c#?
dunno
Is there a way to check if the array/table in lua contains a certain index easily?
and call the refresh function to remove the entities that no longer exist
and of course the parameter index should be the entity.Index you want
Yes
I noticed in your code you use entity.Index, is that basically just a number that differs for each entity in the room?
probably, might want to check it
so I'm guessing it'd be set to the player
which is generally the spawner i believe
Entities have a Parent attribute
https://hastebin.com/ojujozohuk.lua
I also wonder if there's a check for what spawned the entity? ._.
cheers
i'll share the code i used, it's basically the same thing as what you're doing
and globally would mean if multiple bombs go off it wont work, etc... hm
since it resets it each time the effect retriggers
yeah
oh no wait, it'd have to be global
just test it
probably
That should work, no?
```Lua
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      local exploded = false;
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP and entities[i]:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode") and exploded == false then
        exploded = true;
```
I've done something similar by keeping a list of entities that are marked, and flushing entities than no longer exist from it
just make sure to reset it after
that should work
I'll just add a bool and set it after the first check haha
hmm, maybe you could somehow mark the bomb once it's spawned the flies?
what if bombs have shorter fuses at some point
yes, but should that matter particularly?
Mei is so cool
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842051906
but isn't that the frame of the entity's existence, rather than it's sprite?
just debug to find the frame you want from the exploding animation and add that as a conditional for your spawning code
entity.FrameCount should hlep
choose specific frames of the explode animation or something?
any way I can limit that?
that's what I just thought
Maybe the bomb is playing the explode animation for longer than a frame?
I figured out the deeper problem though by adding a debug string to the entity checking
Oh
and? You can still do that with AddBlueFlies
I want them to spawn from the bomb's position though
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_entity_player.html#aa6bf53cb13dd5973deb482e2395ace11 Should probably use player:AddBlueFlies() instead
I want a bomb to explode and spawn 3-10 flies, any ideas why it spawns alot more?
The  entire thing is:

```Lua
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP and entities[i]:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode") then
        for j = 1, math.random(3, 10) do
          Isaac.DebugString("flies");
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
        end
      end
    end
```
seems to spawn alot more, nearrer to 30/40
It's meant to spawn between 3 and 10 blue flies
```Lua
for j = 1, math.random(3, 10) do
          Isaac.DebugString("flies");
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, 0, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
        end
```
Hmm, this doesn't work as intended
Fair enough
In general LengthSquared is better if you're just comparing it against a constant number
eh, I got yet another item
i mean yeah, if you don't need the exact length then use lengthsquared
But why use Length() if you already have LengthSquared() amirite?
unless the length is being called very often
it's just a small optimization really
The difference is pretty big on the scale of multiplication vs square roots
While Length is sqrt(x\*x+y*y)
But considering LengthSquared is x\*x+y*y
Well, not that Length is very slow
It's much faster
Also use LengthSquared() if you don't need exact length
Check the Vector class documentation for more info about it
mhm velocity is stored as a vector
Check if his Velocity:LengthSquared()<0.01
I thought velocity was stored as a vector (0,0)?
Better
there is a Way I guess
just test if his Velocity is 0
has anyone come up with a way to have characters from multiple mods at once without breaking the select screen...?
i'd assume player.Velocity would be either 0 or basically 0, but i haven't tried checking it
like, how would i check if a player isn't moving
How is player.Velocity stored?
oh.
the heck

While I didn't exactly achieve the desired random invincibility effect, I gave Isaac a new scarf
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mtl0b/how_to_enable_achievements_for_resource_lua_mods/ Apparently you can just do this, but that's a lot of work if you have quite a few mods
alternately, a cheat engine patch would probably do the trick, though it's kind of meh to have to use an external program
don't think so
just a matter of "has anyone found the particular change necessary"
well, of *course* you can patch the exe, or pull an antibirth and add hooks in one of the dlls
As far as i know, you can't. But you can just drop the resources into the resources folder, and delete the packed files (from what i've read). Dunno if you can make the scripts run without disabling achievements though
lol
<@229593818691928067>  I'm really uncertain if you're being ironic or not, I actually went and checked ;-;
hmm. has anyone poked at patching the game to not disable ingame unlocks while mods are enabled? <.<
Hex you have to go in `Settings > Accessibility > Enable constructive criticism`
i haven't tried the zerobrane thing, the log has been doing just fine so far for me
This is really valuable, thanks!
I have the ZeroBrane, but it really just tells me why the mod isn't working not why it isnt working the way it's supposed to
(these will print to the log)
the log is so useful for debugging. Adding in prints to the log is also useful, to see what values your getting when they're ones you don't expect. Can be done with Isaac.DebugString(tostring(VariableToTest))
Right, note taken, will rmember this!
everytime
Always look at the log when things aren't working
man, thanks a bunch
right I feel silly now, honestly hadn't looked at the log, I'm pretty new to this
yeah
Am I supposed to put the playerNum inside
line 20, add playerNum into the GetPlayer() call

any idea why this happens ?
sec
what does your log say?
but the onDamage function doesn't seem to work at all
it spawns the item just fine
maybe an end or I dunno, but I just can't find it
But it just stopped working all of the sudden, I might have delted something that I havent seen
It's supposed to spawn a heart every time a player gets hit, it's just a tester for an invincibility effect I'll implement later
Thanks a bunch

sure hex, post the code either here or on something like hastebin
Actually, when defining functions, is there any difference between `function myMod:foo()` and `function myMod.foo()`?
EntityRef got entity
Can any of you guys take a quick look at a rather short piece of code and tell me what I haven't been able to understand for the past hour or so? I'd owe them my life fuf
fuck!
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be an angel
first I need to get the item to work tho
And it should be seeded properly
that would work too
That's an instance of the RNG class from docs
You should be using the RNG passed into the use item function
Random itself isn't a thing
dude
it needs to be a random float for a full number
(assuming that's how this actually works)
so, in your main you could create an instance of RNG and use that to get random numbers later when you need them, so it'd be seeded
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_r_n_g.html You could use this class and make a single RNG seed for your mod
the value "random" is nil
how do I make rng seeded again?
^
fucking retard
oh ok
oh ok
no ender, you already have the player entity, so it'd just be player, not entity_player
robobaby please
herte, i think that your if statements are too nested. You will only ever get one cacheflag in a callback, but to get to the teardelay and range ones, it needs to already be the tearflag cacheflag
is that better?
``        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, ENTITY_PLAYER, 0)``

If anyone actually uses the Room Editor, do they know how to make their own custom main rooms for Greed Mode?
hert, in your items.xml, does the item have a cache attribute?

"rankup"?
lol
grats on rankup Ender
yeah, actually true
but the active item is what is hurting me, so I don't know what to put in dmgSourceEntitiy. Enitity player?
And seeded runs are supposed to go the same
It's an item that can give you life or kill you
And fuck you for that "doesn't need to be seeded"
gives a number between 0 and 2^32
<@!267112861921181697> You have to replace `dmgSourceEntity` with an actual entity
it doesn't need to be seeded >_>
Which is called Random()
There is another built in function for this
its an active item
Then it won't be seeded
although math.random is not seeded
Why use math.random?
use the math.random(n) lua function
rng is for seeds, like for items and such
```function MyMod:use_faith(item, rng)        
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if rng:Random() <= 0.95 then
        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player:AddHearts(2)
        player:AddSoulHearts(1)
        player:AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```?
someone gave it to me, back wen I still asked for code.
Also, probably should use Random(), or something
Where did you get `dmgSourceEntity` even?
what
Where is entity defined?
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with dmgSourceEntity
```function MyMod:use_faith(item, rng)        
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.95 then
        entity:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player:AddHearts(2)
        player:AddSoulHearts(1)
        player:AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```
I'm sorry but I need to ask for help, I have been struggling with this piece of shit for the last few days and I cant figure out whats wrong with it
Yeah, that too, a bit too many variables
depending on what you want to do
well but what if you enter a room that has rocks in the center and blow them up before it's cleared
You would anyway need to find out if anything spawned
Hey I'm trying to do tears up and piercing tears but something went wrong and now in don't want to give me even range up https://hastebin.com/tisawayacu.lua
^
although, you do it before
get the position on room enter
But it will get the position next to the pickup
that would be ugly tho
if not then, dunno, scan all entities in the room, and if an pickup spawns just when isCleared returns true, take that.
thanks i'll try that
that makes sense
try just using GetFreeNearPosition from the center of the room. i assume it uses the same function
Hey guys , is there any way to get the position of the pickup that spawns upon clearing a room ?
So I'm making some rooms for the Greed Mode using the Room Editor, and I'm wondering what I'm supposed to do to make them the main room itself (the one with the button).

Like, is it something to do with the Room ID or the subtype?
nvm got it
doesnt work for me
has anyone worked with Sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet ?
ok
probably better with const Vector & EntityLaser:GetEndPoint ()
it gives you the position where the brimstone either hits the wall
a way to do it is Room:GetLaserTarget(Vector Pos, Vector Dir)
is it possible to get lenght of brimstone?
true! but i rarely come back to old code so i never got the habit of it
So, it's all positive, really
That's true though, you really improve your reading comprehension of bad code when you revisit old stuff
comments are a waste of my time
#commentsmasterrace
I think that makes it worth it over all
the best thing about brainfuck is that almost anything can be a comment automatically

nah, itz noh tah gud
why not brainfuck
why we are coding mods in lua, can i haz LOLCAT api?
right, makes sense, with how you pass functions in the modcallbacks
functions are first-class data types in Lua, so you can create closures and do some interesting stuff with them
Kinda neat
That is a actually quite interesting, so you can have scoped functions.
in Lua you can, but in this scenario it would be better to not have it in the function
not that I know of, anyway
and you can't define functions inside other functions
first function
but also, you are missing an end
oH BOY
i wouldn't need to do that
you need only one
of course
oh
why do you have 2 register mods?
?
did you send two mods?
wait
you are missing one
nope
It looks like I have all my ends already though.
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  
  local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
oh
Yeah, you are missing an end somwehere

Although, you could always keep track if your item is on the ground. If it dissapears and you suddently have the item that should work for rerolls.
Right, that changes things
But I don't want it to trigger on rerolls :P
but rerolls it should work
Not diplopia
It does though
<@124088844181045249> The flag approach doesn't account for diplopia and rerolls :P
Haven't tried
I imagine just spawning the entity?
and how to use it?(i tried to search)
cosmetic entities
Variants of effects, like creep, particles etc.
what is EffectVariant enum for?
then invert the flag
You have a flag if the item is picked up, when you suddently have the item you add 5 bombs
Yeah, but there's no built-in way to detect item pickup
Yay done my 10th item
Oh player:AddBombs(), lol
How would I do that anyways ._.
KubeRoot, your mod didn't award 5 bombs on pickup like most bomb items?
check EntityPlayer docs
How do action triggers work? There's a lovely trigger for ACTIONTRIGGER_BOMBPLACED
Cheers
Yes
So ```Entity:GetSprite():IsPlaying("Explode")``` should work then
`Entity:GetSprite()` is important here
Earlier in the code `{ sprite=bomb:GetSprite() }` or something like that
Not exactly
So ```Lua v.sprite:IsPlaying("Explode")```
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2778/rock-bombs
Hold on
Got a dl link? I'm at work so I can't just sub
If you want an example, you can check out my Rock Bombs mod
<@219159380094877696> To get the exact moment a bomb explodes, I'd recommend detecting the explosion animation on the bomb's sprite
<@203215784770535424> hi
Or anyone know how to get the exact moment a bomb explodes?
The one on the champions and holes, and how you can apply it to an entity
Anyone got any idea how the vacuum effect works?
I'm at work modding away ?
Yo!
Yoooo
So change it to
```xml
<costume anm2path="c_mwings.anm2" priority="23" type="none"/>

you need a `/>` at the end of your line in your xml
Yeah I just saw
Set the tear delay the next frame
Hey, an easy workaround
ty
ill try to do something with that
ok
hmm
Well yeah, as I told you it's broken
When you go to the next floor
Well it's simply `player.MaxFireDelay`
its bugged af
but
Ive managed to get fire delay working
Let me see
Setting it, that is, but maybe you can retrieve it
Fire delay is broken in the current API
Any way to get the fire delay of the player?
Helloes
Hye guys
Plop
But I haven't played around with costumes yet, so I don't think I can help much more

mhm
Sure the path is correct?
```XML
<costume anm2path="c_mwings.anm2" priority="23" type="none">```
and this is probably the line that does that
my mod
Because of your mod, or..?
it crashes on the start
print to the log
cuz the game wont even launch
I cant
that's where it crashes
Well, print out lines in your game, line after line. See after which line it stops printing

At least your fanbase will be dedicated
have fun
all my mods will require a series of 100+ args and extremely esoteric installation methods to play
Personally I'm excited for mods from the one and only egghead
do you think the game grumps community is working on a boi mod for them to play on the show
So, not enough info
`require broken - can't import libraries (intentional?) - yes, intentional, they are working on a sandboxing fix`
actually, it's in the stickied bug thread on reddit
oh well
I can't remember where I read it, can't for the life of me find where he talked about the require stuff
In which case you need to use require
Unless the environment gets split
And use the global environment
That decide load order
Dependencies in metadata.xml
I thought you'd just have, like
Don't quote me
Ohh, wait, one that works with **other** mods?
and your own, I will imagine
that works with other mods
I belive tyrone said that they are working on a sandboxed require
Yes, it's still better than people running viruses from mods
that sucks!
`require` is only available when using `--luadebug` for security reasons
I can give curse of the lost to remove the map
hello! does `require`not work ?
`Room:RemoveDoor`
ohh
I think I can make the wall color transparent to make it more distraction-free
hm
Right, yeah, ofc
Well, the entire floor will be covered by the tetris frame if I get a properly sprited one
Also, if it's possible maybe you can change the tutorial background to a tetris tutorial?
Your tetris game looks so good that you could think it was an original part of the game, honestly
there should be a notepad channel for everybody to confuse the heck outta each other.
That was the one that made me name them "O1" "Z1" instead of "O_maw" etc
I was wondering what that one was
ohhhh
ohright
what
fair enough
I really like the Gemini tetromino
Probably minecraft on mods
Well
What hasnt a better performance than ARK?
Still better performance than Ark.
I'm thinking it might be because I create and dispose of like 40 vectors every tick
memory leak
oh

Alright, that worked. Thanks!

I don't know if you have to do this
and then
OH, okay.
you build resources/gfx/...
in your mod's folder
uh
Can someone tell me how I can replace an item or a character sprite sheet and have it appear in the game? I edited Isaacs sprite sheet and put it where the original was in resources/gfx/characters/costumes and ran the game but nothing changed. Is it not that simple?

One of the Zs is borked
oh no
That was the idea all along ;D
aww nice, I like that they're themed on enemies that's a cool idea
Got a bunch more sprites

I think I remember having this problem with active items before as well.
The items are runes. I tried changing them to cards in the xml and it didn't change anything. There's nothing else that really stands out to me.
No worries. I'm pretty sure I am, yeah. I stripped down the code a bit and tested it with some basic debug strings where the problem still persists. https://hastebin.com/moqamirado.lua
<@112975821186031616> Sorry I'm late, but are you sure you're getting the ID right? I've heard people had trouble with them, but -1 basically means no ID/invalid ID
blazed it
i'm off to sleep
can do
4:20 AM blaze it
Well, it's meant to let you make the own effect if a custom item is used, so you have to conditionalize if it was the item for the effect you want, since custom items will almost all require the use of a callback, and the built in items won't need callbacks
~~Each of my cards seem to trigger every function for every callback, I'm afraid. It's weird, because only the modded items seem to do it, not any of the vanilla ones.~~ Update: This seems to be because all of the card IDs are getting assigned to -1 for some reason.
yeah that one works fine, but i want to inherit the height of the tear spawning them, so it doesn't essentially double the range, so i guess i have to wait for them to patch it in
I was under the impression they were functional
So do Callback arguments (such as item used for MC_USE_ITEM) just not work?
so that one you should be able to access I believe
ya
it's an EntityTear
return a TearEntity?
doesn't Player:FireTear
although
oh, well that works for the damage thing, thanks :D
which is a value the base Entity class has
by accessing "CollisionDamage"
I was able to access damage
at least i know it's not just that i'm being a moron and missing something simple
yeah it is
it's very annoying.
thanks
guess i just wait for an update then
sick
so you can't access the tear-specific values on pre-existing entities
they did not create a ToTear()
however, when they added documentation for the TearEntity class
such as Entity:ToNPC()
there are methods to cast your Entity in to specific types of entities
so under the Entity class
Here's the code
```lua
function Unbirth:showerHeadUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)    
    if (player:HasCollectible(ShowerHead))    then
        RefreshShowered()
        for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
            if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then -- find all the tears
                --Isaac.DebugString(tostring(entity.Index))
                if entity.FrameCount == 15 and CheckShowered(entity.Index) == false  and entity.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then --time in frames reached, not spawned by the shower item, and is from the player, not a familiar etc.
                    local rot = -15
                    local inc = 7.5
                    for i=0,4 do
                        local tear = player:FireTear(entity.Position, entity.Velocity:Rotated(rot + (inc * i)), false, true, false)
                        --tear.Height = entity.Height
                        AddShowered(tear.Index)
                    end
                    entity:Remove()
                end
            end
        end            
    end
end
```
hey, i've been having some trouble with tears. I have an item that makes tears split off into 5 after a certain number of frames, and i want to make the spawned tears do less damage and stay at the height of the tear that they spawned from. Although i know for sure that the entity i have is a tear, it doesn't seem to have any of the attributes a tear should have, such as height, so i can't just pass the height off.
Try something like:

```lua
HasItem = false
function PostUpdate()
  local player = Issac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(<Collectible>) and not HasItem then
      HasItem  = true
      player:GiveSomeSoulHeartsOrSomething()
  elseif not player:HasCollectible(<Collectible>) and HasItem then
      HasItem  = false
  end
end```
<@112975821186031616> Could you link me one of your mods where youve done that becuase I dont really understand.
Way I've done it is to have a false boolean that's set to true and does stuff when you have the collectible if the boolean is false.
Alright
I don't really know
<@128874748041101312> ?
<@128874748041101312> Like say if I picked up a key and I wanted something to spawn how would I do that?
player:HasCollectible()
<@128874748041101312> ^
How do you detect if a player picked up an item
?
there is none
Does anyone know what the call back is for picking up an item?
i'm just making something for a laugh
mostly fixing my mods atm
so what's everybody creating?
Cool worked also how do you check/whats the call back for if someone picked up an item?
I think it would be ```lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LIL_BATTERY, 0, pos, vel, player)
```
Okay so I want to spawn a bettery.
```Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_HALF_SOUL, pos, vel, player)```
What do I do for the sub type and the PICKUP_Battery because I cant find documentation
I had setframe() work
See all you dudes
With that being said, I'm gonna sleep
It's either that or `Sprite::GetFrame()` that always returns the end of the animation but I doubt it
It just force-terminates the animation
New blessing : `Sprite::SetFrame()` doesn't work
because it should have been included, ffs, how hard could it had been
If only it was a official tool like character editor
All I heard were people saying no
Maybe later when the API is better and actually usable
Alright fuck that shit
i heard there is but idk how
Guys, is there any way to add a new character in AB+?
Oooooooh
those bums have zero brains
I set up breakpoints that never triggered, RIP
Shoutout to ZeroBrane for being of no help whatsoever haha
I got it to work with just the three variables you suggested though, but I'll definitely change it
That's correct
Yeah. Except... Positions.
of other objects, I mean
I guess so yeah, but those might collide with existing properties
though I think it would be better to check the Type, Variant, Subtype and other properties
getmetatable returns all the bindings in the object as a table.
userdata means its a reference to a C object
getmetatable(dummySpawner)
Of userdata things, in place of proper Entities
Hum, or not ? Isaac.GetRoomEntities() returned a bunch of pointers
It's supposed to be an entity but isn't even that, it has probably been discarded by the engine
```
dummySpawner
"userdata: 11EC8830"
```
Alright yeah, dummySpawner is just a pointer to some shit
Great
No idea.
I've come accross this problem with Python before but obviously I was much freeer as to what to do with my objects
How to check for equality though ?
Yeah that's entirely possible
equality uses object ids for tables, so the object ids are different, even if the underlying C-based object is the same
How so ?
Mmmh, I have some idea as to what is going on... And it might have to do with how the Lua bindings work.
I'm gonna fire up ZeroBrane and see what it holds (if I can read it)
Welp you've read it, it holds something immutable or some shit
That does not necessarily mean that it's gonna have something on it.
```
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Forcing dummy as spawner
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Should not see this but is not nil
```
It's a member variable of the Entity class is what I mean
huh
`Entity::SpawnerEntity`
It's in the doc
or is it your own variable
is spawnerentity in the documentation
And even if it's nil, me setting it should define it
Well it's documented
it could be a ghost
But what about SpawnerEntity?
I know for a fact newEntity isn't nil since it shows on-screen
Oh yeah ZeroBrane Studios ... right
It's entirely possible it's nil XD
What's in SpawnerEntity? Have you tried setting up a breakpoint and checking its metatable?
Result :
```
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Forcing dummy as spawner
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Should not see this
```
```Lua
Isaac.DebugString("Forcing dummy as spawner")
newEntity.SpawnerEntity = dummySpawner -- ugly but necessary
if newEntity.SpawnerEntity ~= dummySpawner then
    Isaac.DebugString("Should not see this")
end
```
Okay no this is ridiculous
The one that Tyrone asked people to submit questions to on... Friday, was it? No, it has obviously not happened XD
RIP
The one that was supposed to happen last week? No
I'll force that shit if I have to
Also why the fuck won't my entities be spawned by the things I tell them to be spawned by
did tyrone do his megapost answering twitter questions yet
Dirty work
Looked like it yeah
¯\_(?)_/¯
Like, they very quickly did some refactoring for the player class after the initial launch got such flak, for stats.
I don't go as deep as the disassemblies to be honest, so it's good to have your insight on the situation
Guess we're settled on that front
Welp
Considering how simple it generally is to add a lua binding, it's pretty shameful.
It does feel like that yeah
Basically it was very much a "Let's churn out whatever's easiest"
One reason why so many things were missing is because they didn't bother to refactor stuff rolled into inits or things with huge update functions or things hardcoded in.
They didn't add a single new function on release.
Regardless of what the function did.
If you look at the disassembly, it looks like they clearly just exposed anything that was a public function in a class that they didn't think they needed to refactor.
What's that ?
Neither.
Didn't help, going back to effect then
Let's not use an effect then
ie an Entity that was already terminated or is in another room
Oh yeah I see, I think that if you try to give an expired entity as a spawner to Isaac.Spawn it gets ignored
If you expose bindings you're not expecting people to use, that's an accident or a mistake
That's what I call accidentally haha
Or exposed bindings they were not intending to be used for anything at the moment.
I'm pretty sure they exposed many bindings accidentally
The API is far from done
It's weird how there's even a function to get ItemPools then.
Also: Can confirm, you can only have one SpriteOverlay using SetSpriteOverlayFrame.
I don't think there's ItemPool manipulation in Lua yet.
I still don't understand why ``Game:GetItemPool()`` doesn't allow you to specify an Item Pool to get. Or why they don't have documentation on how to work with ItemPools.
That way there's no way it'll get deleted behind my back
Or for better safety I could just use any entity type, put it outside the screen and make it invisible
It's weird
And that's supposed to be done via Entity.SpawnerEntity but it ain't working
I hold a dummy entity effect for the sole purpose of finding back the dummy entities I have spawned to hold the boss's death animation while the room gets cleared status
Example: Monstro's Tooth
Right
Effects are, well, effects. They appear, do their thing, and are gone
It's common sense
Game ded
Well what can I say
Nothing normally in the game gets spawned by an entity effect XD
Great
Crashed the game instantly xD
I'm gonna do a stupid thing and assume that nothing normally in the game gets spawned by an entity effect
RIP
```Lua
local newEntity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, 0, 0, boss.Position, Vector(0, 0), dummySpawner)
Isaac.DebugString(newEntity.SpawnerEntity == dummySpawner and "Should show this" or "Should not show this")
```
That showed "Should not show this" in log
I tell the game to spawn using a certain spawner and it doesn't
Wow rude
I am gonna try it out XD
Throwing it out there: Is it possible to have more than 1 overlay frame on a sprite using SetSpriteOverlayFrame ??
"Oh boy I'm sure glad I create that entity so that reference is not nil" - doesn't store the reference so it's still nil
Yep found it haha
I'm just doing something else wrong
Yeah no GetRoomEntities does return ENTITY_EFFECT
Either im stupid to not do that or that API is shit... (Both is correct :D)
O_O
You do something like
```Lua
var ents = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
ents[0]:ToPickup()
```
?
Well that's not how you're supposed to use `ToPickup()` haha
I did spawn it with Isaac.Spawn too
Isaac.GetRoomEntities() doesnt even return correct entities i think. i tried Isaac:ToPickup(x) on that guys and it throws errors like crazy :/
As opposed to GridEntityType
Nope, they're listed with EntityType
I think EntityEffects are actually grid entities....?
Also it advertises itself as returning any and all entities
Weird, `Isaac.GetRoomEntities()` doesn't seem to return ENTITY_EFFECT entities
Does `DamageFlag.DAMAGE_INVINCIBLE` actually work? It doesn't damage me when I'm invincible.
That includes opening devil deal door if relevant, dropping items etc
Open the doors, yes ; clear a room, nope
is there no command to open the doors?
Same as before, trying to make a room open without waiting for a boss's death animation to be done
what's ur issue?
And annoyed you all enough with this haha
I've tried hard enough already
I think my only hope is to switch back to having the boss play the animation as soon as possible and hope nobody notices
Although boss.SpriteScale did
Using boss.Color or bossSprite.Color didn't help
Not sure I can force that, since the variant is dependent on the EntityType
Wow there's 9 unlocks per character not counting coop babies... that's a lot of stuff to come up with if I want to pretend custom achievements are possible :P
they all have the same anm2. just differnt colours
default to the non-coloured version
Ah. True. XD
I know that, what I mean is that the death animation defaults to the non-champion form
Champion bosses are variants
Also for some reason it doesn't handle champion bosses (the version I have going on)
That's never gonna work
Let's try a back-and-forth trick, where the entity I just created actually re-copies itself back to the previous boss entity hahaha
As well as Krampus's item drop
That sucks
I assume they're hardcoded into each boss's entity
Oh hey hang on, none of the animation triggers actually trigger
but dosent do anythign but say "workign as intended"
shoudl amke a mod for Isaac that add's poise
Yeah yeah sorry
its more so spam then anything
I like to do that when I'm really fucking pissed
It's for the dramatic effect, sorry.
I am sure it is like DS3's poise -- There, but not there XD
And then updated to be Actually There XD
can you try to type things in one line?
sigh
...
non-stop
straight
For 3 days
I've just been doing it wrong
no it is, like DS3's poise <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121>
That was actually extremely easy
'grats!
It works xD just like that
Well shit I did it
I am guessing that yes, it's not working as intended XD
<:plum:259939492008296448>
best API
Child is nil, GetLastChild() returns a reference to Isaac.
10/10
Nope! Even if Isaac has 10 familiars, calling GetLastChild() or the Child attribute does not do that
or soemthing
then use that to make the chain
I imagenyou get Isaac's children(which should be the familiers)
In Lua, you need to use the MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE callback, and call familiar:FollowParent()
Word of warning: I don't know everything. My #1 missing thing is how to put the familiar in a familiar chain
<@269562360295849985> Yeah I have the sprite I just dont know how to do it all like make it follow you and spawn when you pick it up.
Well that's awkward, I beat Blue Baby already haha
<:plum:259939492008296448>
OK, <@195368190333812736> , you want to make a familiar? I am sortof maybe the person you want to ask things.
For fuck's sake
Which means it did nothing when I left the part uncommented.
lol
There was an error in my script all that time.
Wait
Nope, nothing like that
Which makes me think that I should actually check the ANM2 file in case there isn't a flag in there for the death animation to be blocking
check the reddit
there probably is
Like is there a tutorial out there?
In the desired fashion
Anyone know how I can make my mod a familiar?
And again, this successfully opens the damned door :
```Lua
-- remove the animation altogether in lack of a better method
local boss = ents[i]
local bossSprite = boss:GetSprite()
-- local newSpriteName = bossSprite:GetFilename()
-- local newEntity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, 0, 0, boss:Position, Vector(0, 0), Isaac.GetPlayer(0))
-- local newSprite = newEntity:GetSprite()
-- newSprite:Reset()
-- newSprite:Load(newSpriteName, true)
-- newSprite:Play("Death", true)
-- newSprite.PlaybackSpeed = 0.5
boss:Remove()
```
I also made the entity a child entity of the player to not accidentally make it blocking
```Lua
-- remove the animation altogether in lack of a better method
local boss = ents[i]
local bossSprite = boss:GetSprite()
local newSpriteName = bossSprite:GetFilename()
local newEntity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, 0, 0, boss:Position, Vector(0, 0), Isaac.GetPlayer(0))
local newSprite = newEntity:GetSprite()
newSprite:Reset()
newSprite:Load(newSpriteName, true)
newSprite:Play("Death", true)
newSprite.PlaybackSpeed = 0.5
boss:Remove()
```
I mean, it's not blocking when I don't spawn the entity (which is not supposed to be blocking)
wait till the last one till they open the door
it might be countign the frames then
Also, death animation still blocking confirmed
Don't worry, I'm French, somebody told it to me haha
That feeling when
TFW?... I feel out of touch with the youth...
Glory
For once
Thanks game
While having Technology
And casually get Tech X + 6 shots
TFW you try your death animation-suppressing mod on the Hush
Haven't checked how to make entities though. XD
Makes no sense
Why did I go for a pickup
That's even what I wanted to do xD
Oh yeah that's right
Idea: The "death animation" entity should be an *effect*
I remove the boss anyway
No, I make sure to spawn a pickup and remove the boss
because an enemy is still in the room till the animation is over, then the entity is removed
ie the boss is correctly removed
And I checked that removing the dummy entity I put actually does fast-forward the unlocking
Now, it actually does just that, but for some reason it still waits for the animation to be done to unlock the room ...
I then modify its sprite to play the boss's death animation
Upon boss death, I remove the boss entity and create a new, non-room-blocking one (hopefully)
I did exactly what we said
Here's what I did
about?
Alright I'm a tad confused
True, true
or behind
yeah, would be kinda weird to have it just apeare ontop of him
I removed him before his animation started, no item pedestal for me
Fun fact : Krampus is supposed to drop shit only after his death animation is done apparently xD
What's the character ID for apollyon and keeper?
we hardly knew ye
RIP ENTITY_NULL
Apparently ENTITY_NULL doesn't stay around, it lives one frame
same
I can't draw or make music for mods though
Hahaha
dope, I envy you lol
I'm a coder myself
Good question
Or is it mostly sprite artists + coders?
Just out of curiosity, are there a lot of people here to make music for mods too?
Also, has anyone tried to spawn an ENTITY_NULL ? What does it do ? Does it stick around ?
I just never know when to stop
Alright I'll try a crazy thing haha
In my case it's not so bad since I'll always be replacing the "Death" animation, but I don't know how champion bosses are handled
One is for replacing the PNG, the other is for replacing the animation file + PNG
But as I said, you can't retrieve the animation currently playing
Yeah
The first argument is a path to the ANM2
It takes care of the PNG file for you if the second argument is true
Rather Entity:GetSprite():Load(string path, boolean loadGraphics)
Entity:GetSprite():ReplaceSpritesheet (integer LayerId, string PngFilename)
One big obstacle is that you can't retrieve the name of the animation being played by a Sprite
That might be possible yeah
I am certain you can't change the Sprite *object*, but it might be possible to programatically *replace* the *contents* of the Sprite.
Are we positive we can't give an arbitrary Sprite object to an Entity ?
That does make sense
I think GetData() is used for entity data that is saved when exiting and returning to a run. It's the only thing I can think of that would make sense.
No matter how I do it, it does not do damage to the player, yet all my other items do?
And I have only tried it on bosses
Which is what ?
Have ou tried to use GetData() on multiple entities & types? I have my suspicions as to what GetData is supposed to do, but haven't sat down to try it.
but...
That also works
The player is an entity
There isn't a damage fuction for Isaac, only entities
is there a way to do damage to the player?
Happy now ?
`ents[i]:GetData()` gives `{}`
I mean duh
i think you need to give it an entity to get data from...
Welp looks like `Entity::GetData()` returns an empty table, good to know
```function MyMod:use_faith(item, rng)        
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.95 then
        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player:AddHearts(2)
        player:AddSoulHearts(1)
        player:AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```
I mean, I can't even figure this out
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5o5tsy/super_secret_shops/
i was curious if it was at all possible to do this
I don't think so, but yet again I suck at moding so I cant be sure.
as in new types
Is it possible to add new rooms at all?
The debugger isn't finding errors for it...
Aight, I don't know what is wrong with this code.
Cool
Oh, Lua has a syntax for that
I'm guessing we can't know since the lack of `require` forbids us from using a serializer
Also, does anybody know what `Entity::GetData()` returns
Any idea is welcome >_>
No animation events since I don't handle them ; no depth sorting since I can't display shit outside of MC_POST_RENDER
That makes several problems though
``player:AddEternalHearts(1);`` whats wrong with this line? my zerobrane debugger made a breakpoint here...
lol
Also yes
So far my solution was to catch its death, remove the entity, create a Sprite containing its death animation and play it afterwards
Oh, are you helping Zamiel?
What I'm trying to do is to make a room's doors open right after a boss is dead, and not after its animation is done
Oh alright
I believe only EntityNPCs will prevent the room from opening
Or ENTITY_EFFECT, really
I should try creating an ENTITY_NULL and see what happens
Not a sprite as in an image
A Sprite object, that is
And also how do I give it a sprite I created
Guys what's an entity that doesn't prevent the rooms from opening
ok.
You should replicate what you see in pocketitems.xml in the game's resources
what should I search in the doc for card creation?
Yep
is it possible to add cards to the cardpool yet?
"end' expected (to close if at line 6) near <eof>"
so i searched ERR in the log and i found a thing it says
yeah you're right
But yeah you do need to start reading it haha
Sorry
yeah no
Oh okay, I thought you meant "I do read it already"
what do you mean i don't? i meant i do as in i do need to start reading my log
Also same thing with player and Player when you change the stats
No you don't, this shit shows up
i do
Dude you need to start reading your log
an entire mod
can mess up
a single case
Cacheupdate vs CacheUpdate in the callback
Case error in the function's name
```LUA
  local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = Player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = Player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
Sure
I'll paste the code
sec*
Gimme a sed
How do I get Cricket's Collar to work?
Hey so
See you
Damn
im off, cya
gravity bombs, randomized pill/trinket effects and all that nice stuff
well, time to get onto the super complex items tomorrow
Okay well that's alright ...
i already had gyazo XD
> goes for gyazo
> advises streamable or gifycat
shame there's no sound ofc haha
https://gyazo.com/154527167a471cc13eef4b3d91b8bce9
Or Gifycat or something
Streamable looks like one
thats what im wondering xD
Apparently yeah, people keep posting them
any easy way to record a gif btw?
i wondered why some hearts ran away
the 'scared heart' is actually a thing
Oh son of a
It always is
it was so dull without sounds
exactly
A new dimension for your items
now if you use the black market when there's an organ item like placenta on a pedestal rather than on hearts, it gives you the dollar and plays ultra greed's slot machine sounds haha
Added sounds to my items XD
already did my first sprite, just need to catch up
Well lucky you
I'm doing all my own sprites/sounds tbh
I can't draw for shit so I'll do that when I need gfx
Or have people draw them haha
I guess
Draw things that are commonly associated with them
like, how do you sprite ADHD and glossophobia
and then figure out how the heck i'm gonna make sprites for these
now i just need to find suitable sound clips
someday...
lel
Soon in a cinema near you
"Matrefeytontias and the seeking for sense"
Okay hum so I got `Sprite::Render` to work by giving it two zero vectors for the two clamp parameters ...
gonna add parameters for volume and pitch lol
It's logical that it does haha
cant believe that worked lol
Hahaha
enjoy
If you want sounds, you just call madPack.playSound(SoundEffect.SOUND_HERE)
```Lua

function madPack.playSound(sound)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  local soundGuy = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FLY, 0, 0, player.Position, Vector(0,0), player):ToNPC();
  soundGuy:PlaySound(sound, 1.0, 0, false, 1.0);
  soundGuy:Remove();
end

```
seperated it into its own function
jeez it works ?
Framerate is wrong though
Sorta got it to work
```Lua
local soundGuy = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FLY, 0, 0, player.Position, Vector(0,0), player):ToNPC();
        soundGuy:PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_DIMEDROP, 1.0, 0, false, 1.0);
        soundGuy:Remove();```
I AM SEVERAL GENIUSES
And also OMG I GOT IT TO WORK
Hahaha obviously
you just create a shitty fly, make it play a sound then remove it
it DOES work
HAHA
Just may
This madness may have an end
same
Hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on
I did a thing
OH
SOUNDS.
ToNPC
sure you called
"attempt to call a nil value (method 'PlaySound')"
groan
Bad argument 3 in Spawn, ugh
One could say I've been trying for a while
Just might
I might be repeating myself too
Welp, I still have no idea how `Sprite::Render` works
That too
open up resources/entities2.xml in the game files ?
Try things out
0 and 0 ?
but it needs a variant and subtype in isaac.spawn
ie an NPC
Well it's just a normal fly
Oh
so i can turn it into an npc and play a sound
I mean an enemy black fly
Or something
I have no idea what variants or subtypes it'd use etc
`EntityPlayer::SpawnBlueFly`
Isaac.Spawn()?
Still can't get anything out of `Sprite::Render`
How would I spawn a fly somewhere using lua? :v
Although I only display a single frame there, not the whole sprite
congratz
xD
PRAISE THE LORD
k. havent tried it with not-custom sounds yet...
IT WORKIN
YES
i haven't tried
<@229593818691928067> have you gotten it to work with custom sounds?
sure
anyways, can i just spawn an NPC when I want, and make it play a sound instantly, then remove it or something?
ok then
i havent even streamed in 2 days and someone follows right now
Great, love it
It's still not working
well no my entity was already an NPC
._.
wtf someone followed my stream
for some it seemed to work
it worked for me
same here
but that didnt work for me
since the only way atm seems to be to turn an entity into an NPC and then play a sound
oh
yeah, I'm just trying to find how on earth to add sounds into functions
just by putting it in the same file position in resources, can't you?
you can replace the sounds
uh
groan
it doesn't have a main.lua.
Found a mod that replaces the hurt sound with something else
Cute grunt sounds kinda disturbing oo
well. okay then ^^
ok
Sound id 25: 'Cute grunt'
I didn't even know that was a problem
"is there a way to transform screen to world coordinates?" ?
But that's not helping
Except maybe "help what's happening"
How can I ask when I don't know the question
have fun
I'm gonna rip a hole in spacetime and kill the first human
ASK FOR GODS SAKE D:
That there's a fucking function to do that
doesnt really work in big rooms tho i believe
And you tell me NOW
THE WHOLE DAY
I've been trying shit
lewd
xD
.... fuck my ass
ScreenToWorld in the Isaac namespace
you do realize theres a function for transforming the coordinates?
ehh
There's at least a factor 2 going on
Okay no entity space is clearly different than sprite space
let me know if you find out why ?
i wish
i dont know.
A mod I checked out uses:
```Lua
entities[i]:ToNPC():PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_VAMP_GULP, 1.0, 0, false, 1.0)
```

but it doesn't work for me?
havent got them to work either
they seem to only be accessible through NPC entities
Yeah I have no idea how to add sounds
of 99
and add a priority
no ID?
YAY
```XML
<costume anm2path="character_michaelwings.anm2" isFlying="true" type="none">```
it crashes
when I add this
apparently
Hm
sounds don't seem to work >_>
yet
I never used it in anything
I dont have Firedelay
you have to use another cache flag to update it afaik
and it's bugged anyways
it's firedelay
I feel like wut
```invalid cacheflag entry: tears
[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...
```
Interesting
or am I missing something
Why do you HAVE to make an entity an NPC just to play a sound?
wb
but i still code differently here
wb
Heyo
i use it at work too
ok i'm back bois
la callback
```fuffles:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, fuffles.costumeStuff);```
no brackets is crime
Im a C# Maniac
also you don't need brackets around  the if statement
when do you call costumestuff, whats the callback
and fuffles, it seems to be?
idk about sprites tho
something like that, to spawn a coin there
```Lua
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
  for i = 1, #entities do
    if entities[i].Type == EntityType.boss thing or whatever then
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY, entityPos, Vector(0,0), player);
```
I don't geeeet iiiiiiiit
It's what I doooooo
can't you just find when the entity dies and just use it's position
thiis is right, right?
I just want to display the sprite at the same spot the boss was
What are you trying to make work? ?
```LUA
function fuffles:costumeStuff( currentPlayer )
    local   player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local   angelWings = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/character_michaelwings.anm2")
    
    if (player:GetPlayerType() == Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName("Michael")) then
        player:AddNullCostume(angelWings)
    end
end```
Well dammit
I got them from a boss entity
?
I did not input these values
adding a costume without even existing
Im so smart
oh yeha
and post image results
try 120/280
I mean it makes no sense
looks like it could be...?
can u do it with hush's head XD
what did u do to my boi
seems  about right
This is definitely not (320, 280) right ?
I see Rag Mens Head

Tell me I'm not crazy
?
Guys this can't be right
try to remake it
but please dont copy an existing syringe and recolor the fluid
then do a syringe
nothing i can sprite too easily lol
causes are pretty ordinary - early birth, smoking/drugs in pregnancy etc
Im just a spriting guy
good question
how do you play a sound btw
what causes ADHD
I mean
dunno
idk
maybe a brain with an area glowing
^_^
mostly because Im doing Michael atm
I have like 0 items working atm
What on earth do I sprite for it tho
ADHD sounds gr8 xD
Glossophobia, ADHD, Pica Paint, Broken Hearted and Black Market!
5 items now working, 4 passive 1 active!
yay!
AHA i got it to work
But they just use remove collectible :v
```LUA
function Xitems:ComboBreaker_use( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    for i = 1, CollectibleType.NUM_COLLECTIBLES+ItemCount, 1 do
        if player:HasCollectible(i) and i ~= ComboBreaker_item then
            player:RemoveCollectible(i)
            Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE,i,Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,1),Vector(0,0),player)
        end
    end
    player:RemoveCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Combo Breaker" ))
    return true
end```
there's also player:GetActiveItem, wondering if i can remove it after
I think its this
can you find me the mod?
it removed ur items
there is an item in a mod that added a vaccum
?
I know a solution
!!!
player:DischargeActiveItem() doesn't work
player:RemoveCollectible(item) doesn't work
trying to find a way to remove the player's active item
My item just won't die
Nice
since that's where people look for card data?
Maybe put the text in the bottom right, above where the card would go normally?
nice mod
yes ?
suddenly, wolf sausages
but back to important stuff
https://youtu.be/Tue0QEKm9Rg
new patch for External item descriptions ? what do you think ?
I have garbage
mhm
lol
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
Robo Butty Worshipper, what were my items again
I have so far a Battery and something else
nice
Why did robo baby 2.0 just tell me I found teleport 2.0
learning fast ftw
I've been modding for about 24 hours
^_^
okay, that solves a lot
the gfx/characters/costume is your own path
but does it use isaacs original path or my mods path
but for you, spawning as your character would be the only check
and call that function when an item is picked up
You can also add variables like 'costume_1_added = 0' and then have a costumeupdate function to set the costumes
something along those lines
THE SOLUTION
O.O
```Lua
function modname.onPlayerInit(player)
local blah = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/costume.anm2")
player:AddNullCostume(blah)
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, mod.onPlayerInit)
```
hmm, here
that might work for you
but idk how to too
no
hmm
have you tried adding the custome upon the callback MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT
and until some mod hits that a solution will be available
Fuffles
cuz I might do the wumbo random 10 numbers
Is it a screen clamp ? Is it sprite clipping ? Is it animation limits ?
hmm I wonder whats the biggest ID
I have an item that wont remove itself
we all have le issues
Yeah but what is it supposed to beeeeee
xD
something to clamp in the corners? xD
How am I supposed to even
And what in the fucking fuck is topLeftClamp and bottomRightClamp
yaaaay.
\o/
which adds a chance to collide with another mod and crash
unless I add an ID
hmm
Okay so why would Sprite::RenderFrame work but not Sprite::Render
they will be added to the thing with the same name
costumes work rly garbage
but?
but
not sure if it'll work like that
yeah
do you have your own costumes xml
cuz Michael also has Hair
cuz I dont think I **can** add 2 custom costumes
similar enough to fate ?
fml
id21 is the angel transformation
well
I suppose I can only use none
the ones that work are the 'none' type costumes for characters
The costume you're trying to access is a passive item costume
which is
I figured out the problem fuffles
XD
Alright thanks
and I knew it would
in wiping my char out........
emperor is 4
it worked
you mean like 1-13
Its number I mean
How much is the emperor card already ?
and should be similar to what you want
21 should work fine
Costumes fault
Ok, then try 21
yep another crash
If not, I have an alternative for you
ok testing 138
but it may do otherwise
theoretically it should give you the stigmata effect
no costume, works
I just want to check with 138
that too
Imma first check without the costume at all
just testing something
just change the ID of that in your players.xml to 138
what doess 138 do
try costume 138 if that doesnt work
nope no change at all
maybe now it works
I cleaned up my main a little
The Fate died
hmm
```XML
<costume anm2path="173_Mitre.anm2" id="173" type="passive">
    </costume>
    <costume anm2path="176_Stem cells.anm2" id="176" type="passive">
    </costume>
    <costume anm2path="179_Fate.anm2" id="179" isFlying="true" type="passive">
    </costume>```
Where'd you get the value 179 from?
```[INFO] - Initialized player with Variant 0 and Subtype 16
[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...
```
and le log
ah
```XML
<players bigportraitroot="gfx/ui/stage/" nameimageroot="gfx/ui/boss/" portraitroot="gfx/ui/boss/" root="gfx/characters/costumes/">
    <player bigportrait="PlayerPortraitBig_Michael.png" hp="2" armor="2" items="" costume="179" canShoot="false" name="Michael" nameimage="PlayerName_Michael.png" portrait="PlayerPortrait_Michael.png" skin="Character_Michael.png" skinColor="-1" />
</players>```
That's huge progress, because now I just have to figure out the positioning
How are you adding the costume
Well I went from "displays nothing" to "displays something in the wrong place"
but well I must figure it out
lol
I guess
Makes no sense but it's progress
FINALLY
what is your mod meant to do lol

noice
XD
IT DISPLAYED A THING
GUYS
179 aka Fate aka wings
HAAAAAH
hm
oh
because I use the vanilla costume
uhm, no
more spriting issues ;D
for some reason my game crashes since I added a costume to my new char
haha what's up
~~now help me~~
np
thanks
good point!!
when he spins his money eyes
Ultra Greed has it
about kaching
and oh ok
...dang, my active item still doesn't destroy itself
with someone
I think ultra greed needs to be killed
How does one get gold hearts normally in the game btw
now comes the question, what is wrong
interesting
(3997476838)
[INFO] - Initialized player with Variant 0 and Subtype 16
[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...
dime pickup sound is cool
And also eat shit
Cheers game
Aaaaaand of course it gives me a boss with no death animation so I can't actually check
need it for using my black market active item
Is there some sort of 'kaching' sound other than money being picked up? xD
Alright, same code, different callback
If this works, I swear I'm gonna suicide my own ass
I will be more salty than I was
if yes
or am I not alowed to use vanilla costumes for my char
> is a fucking idiot
and rip
you and I were right matrey ?
> before the POST_RENDER callback
YAY using the item no longer resets my stats
> displaying sprite
I just realized
OK now the real test
Hang on a minute
does my char need to fly or wut
... oh
Even by forcing to do so in the POST_UPDATE loop
but well, WHYY
log.txt shows no error, but whatever I do, nothing is being rendered on the screen
then tell the Lost to stop picking up the mind
The mind is being lost right now
??
I need a working example using Sprites
Alright dudes this is a state of crisis
how "costume="179"" broke the game
Im wondering
a highly inteligent doggo that can type
No, I am a dog
mhm
oh apparently cache_firedelay is bugged
you are a dog ??
and
yea
you have a dog's name haha
<@146600389779783680>
Yessss
I broke my game
CanFly
why
Is it bad that I made an item i wouldn't want to pick up :v
I think there was a bool for that
stupid questions, how would I give the char the ability to fly without an item
spawn 5.100.id
There was something like that yeah
Any way to spawn in an item and not just give it to the player with the console?
Oh and the CacheFlag for firedelay doesn't seem to work? ?
There's that
Second line is .addcallback instead of :addcallback
Ah! I do!
```Lua
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, madPack.pica_paint_stats);
madPack.AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, madPack.pica_paint_effect);
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, madPack.glossophobia_effect);
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, madPack.broken_hearted_trigger, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER);
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, madPack.broken_hearted_effect);
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, madPack.adhd_effect);
madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, madPack.black_market_effect, blackMarket);
```

see anything wrong?
Because it never checked the type before that
I'm guessing you called AddCallback wrong in your own code, but it only triggered an error in the game's file
"number excpeted, got function"
oh?
It's pointing to a game file
That's not your file though
log file says:
ERR: resources/scripts/main.lua:7: bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got function)

line 7 is:
```local blackMarket = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Black Market");```
Yes you are x)
well, time to try to make my char flying
Now things are just getting silly
~~yea counting money makes a man rly busy~~ Im too salty, sorry XD
He's a busy man
we will know in about 7 days minimum
Imma ask him on twitter
how can i reply to a steam comment ?
plox
fix thaat
tyrone
Somebody was asking about that earlier, we didn't figure it out
whyyy
<@146600389779783680> not that I know
I'll just try and render the thing anyway
sigh
I just have no idea how the Sprite class works
Yeah it's fine haha
no idea man sorry
did anyone find a way to assign custom costumes via a different way than having the same name as the thinggy you wanna use it for?
uugh
Also, I'm not 100% positive on what the `TopLeftClamp` and `BottomRightClamp` (last two arguments of `Render()`) do or  how they're used
My problem is that `onGoingSprite` is non-nil for one single frame, which I'm guessing is the time it takes to make it nil because of the instantly failing condition check
All of this is in a MC_POST_UPDATE callback
```Lua
-- Loading stuff :
            onGoingSpriteName = ents[i]:GetSprite():GetFilename()
            onGoingSprite = Sprite()
            onGoingSprite.Load(onGoingSpriteName)
            onGoingSprite:Play("Death", true)
            spritePosition = ents[i].Position
-- Playing stuff :
   if onGoingSprite ~= nil then
        onGoingSprite:Update()
        if onGoingSprite:IsPlaying("Death") then
            onGoingSprite.Render(spritePosition, Vector(0, 0), Vector(1000, 1000))
        else
            onGoingSprite = nil
        end
    end
```
Here's how I do it
I'm simply trying to get a sprite to play an animation
what's yer problem <@203215784770535424> ?
no chance
I tried to find a way to change tear sprites
I'm not going into sprite stuff xD
I need somebody knowledgeable on the matter, HALP
Also I'm struggling as all fucks to get sprites working the way I want
Just use a flag or two and use a cache callback
gonna try fix it, gah
They may reset the order in which items' cache is processed
That could and probably is the problem
So i guess active items reset the cache of all stats? ._.
MC_EVALUATE_CACHE
Yeah definitely
Could my problem stem from changing stats on MC_POST_UPDATE not MC_CACHE_UPDATE or something
cya
See you Saxarok o/
I'll take it haha
bye
You came across as knowledgeable xD
I'm supposed to be the newbie here, look at you all asking me shit ?
haha ?
I mean you were here when I arrived
oh dang
I only started modding Isaac two days ago xD
How should I know dude man bro
but how?
I guess
but if i would make custom splash?
Brimstone has a splash, but I've never seen the angel ray have a splash since it goes through walls
<@203215784770535424> what do you mean by "not for this particular ray"?
halp
Even if the active item has no effect
using the active item removes stat changes from ALL my other passive items
Like when Brimstone touches a wall ? Probably not for this particular ray
or is there a way to add splash at the end?
Never ditch code like that
Keep the code, maybe it'll come in an update
Yeah ...
<@203215784770535424> thats so depressing ?
so much for nothing
yet nowhere in the active item's code does it mention stats
however it keeps the change to tears that the passive item made
Using my active item removes the stat changes from the passive item in my mod, and not any from items outside my mod
I have no idea why this happens xD
Well that's RIP
no
spawn 7.5
And is that going through walls ?
u can try and spawn the beam using in game console
yes!
So if you use Brimstone internally, it might not work, but you're telling me you're using the correct beam
The "going through walls"-ness seems to me like an inherent property of that beam though
oh
Welp not really, sorry
<@203215784770535424> any thoughts?
The weird part is it keeps the tear color effects the passive item gave
Gotcha
When i use the active item I made, it removes the stat changes made from my other passive item? ._.
it is like brim
<@219159380094877696> use "." not ":" in Isaac.GetFree.....
<@203215784770535424> that is angle beam
GetFreeNearPosition says it takes a Vector for the first one
"bad argument #1 to 'GetFreeNearPosition' (number expected, got userdata)" 

```Lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY, Isaac:GetFreeNearPosition(entities[i].Position, 1), player);
```

Any ideas why this errors?
entities[i] is the entity that is being removed, a soul heart
Which does indeed go through walls
That looks awfully like what the angels have
Is that internally Brimstone ?
Oh yeah I see
https://streamable.com/zmu4d
for my item
Why do you need that ?
Don't think so
so, there is no real way to make brim pass walls?
And this time I double-checked
I am of the annoy
Why can't I retrieve the name of the animation that a Sprite is currently playing
Check the log
i still have the active item
player:RemoveCollectible(blackMarket) didn't work? :v
Alright, thanks
..oh. It didn't work perfectly, damn
Basically the function is an iterative process. It checks nearby positions, if it can't find any, it checks a little further out. The step is how much further out it checks if it fails
What does the step do?
For the step I just put 1, but I'm sure theres a better way
It takes a Vector position and a float step
Takes a float and a 'step'?
It sure is haha
that's a damn helpful function ?
GetFreeNearPosition
I don't have the docs under the eyes
For the position, use Isaac.GetFreePosition or something
I'm doing
```Lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY, entities[i].Position, Vector(0,0), player);
```
how do I make them spawn in the next free space
I want soul hearts and double hearts to give 2 coins, but they spawn on top of each other
Great idea
That's awesome haha
I'm making an active item that trades in hearts for coins, and organ related items for dollars
Yeah just Remove
Oh my god even the item replacement worked
works so far ?
assuming the heart has been assigned to entity then yeah entity:Remove()
idk how to use it
just :Remove()?
maybe something like GridCollisionClass
Ok so entities[i]:Die() doesn't remove the pickup, what can I do to remove a heart that's lying on the ground?
i didnt see that bit
oh right yeah
Brimstone goes through obstacles already, but it hits walls
Walls are not obstacles
you could spawn a brim laser on the other side of the rock it hits
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
oh
Not sure that's possible
i need to make brimstone laser go through walls
no
Do you mean like the item that makes it go through one side of the screen to the opposite side?
you probably should mention that youre talking about an brimstone laser ^^
Spectral tears go through walls too
penetration tears?
not walls
nah, it goes through objects
wow.
Spectral tears I'm guessing
rly?
Yeah. Tear Flags.
guys, is there a way to make projectile pass through walls?
Soo
C++ is used for a lot of games
Dude what the fuck is even your point
Cue the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, please.
ONe of those glorious fun moments in life where you step back and realize how much of a dipshit you really are in the bigger scheme of things
I honestly had no idea CPP was capable of this, though honestly like someone with common fucking sense I should have actually payed attention, and seen this coming.
most of what I know is like how to make a fucking calculator, run literally the most basic of programs that use Command Prompt.
I don't think I actually use it, and it doesn't do anything anyway, I can remove it
It doesn't have the "function" keyword is what I mean
The Game class represents the game itself, including rooms, levels, etc. all of which don't exist when the mod starts
so I have incredibly limited knowledge in Binary, CPP, and Hex from whatever my father knew back in the Navy.
the game = Game() is still local, it's only for my code
Haha
C++
I don't know a language that doesn't use functions in some form, to be honest.
It will likely return nil
The Game() function can not be used in the global context
my extent of programming knowledge is limited because I was the only dumbass in the class that had "Giving a fuck" syndrome
Maybe it's that in high school, most of what I learned was how to do Couts and shit like that
it's the format
I know they ar ebut
<@193389830690963457> you can't use things like `Game()` at top-level, top-level code is ran outside of a game context
Also, Thank you a lot for the explenation it helps me a lot
Functions are a pretty common thing in a lot of programming languages
guys, is there a way to make projectile pass through walls?
I see these functions in programming and they look like C# to me
You're drunk mate x)
Lua looks nothing like C#
That's why I keep dumbassing it up over here
It doesn't, it really really doesn't
so why the fuck does LUA look like it's C#
<@203215784770535424> these are teh crucial bits and yet it still applies the stat infinitely Alright important bits ```

I've used C++ a lot, I mean shit two years ago I was studying it in a programming course
Which wouldn't be possible because none of the vanilla items are implemented in Lua
Here's what confuses me though
But you'll need lua to actually make them function.
It won't tell you how its implemented, but it will show you the item definition
Oh thanks ?
I'd like some sort of acknowledgement if you don't mind
In the root folder of the extraction there should be an items.xml file
The items.xml file is right in the root of the resources directory.
<@166300204495011841> that was your explanation
I've extracted those, but aren't those just assets, sounds etc, not xmls?
You have to run it from cmd though
you can extract the game's resources with the gameextractor tool
After running the resource extractor in the tools directory, of course.
<@219159380094877696> see the game's resources, in C:/programs and shit/Steam/SteamApps/TBoI/resources
Have you used the resource extractor in the tools directory?
dang :v Anywhere I can see the tags for things in items.xml? Trying to figure out how active item's tags work
Most if not all Lua functions we use are actually pointers to C++ functions
Your best bet is to look at mod items around the workshop.
You can't see how existing items are made.
Get it now ?
And that's what we're using right now
How can I grab the xmls of the game itself, so I can see how existing items are made?
So all the dudes at Nicalis had to do was to write C gateways (named bindings) from Lua to their own C++ code
A consequence of this is that one can write Lua functions ... in C
Another big advantage of Lua is that it's written in C (the language itself), which obviously is compatible with C++
So that means one can easily include a Lua interpretor in their game, which is what they did
Lua is an interpreted language, and its interpretor is known to be extremely small (around 190 kB)
The way they did it (which is by far the easiest) is by using Lua scripts
That is, ways for external users such as us to call functions that are inside the game
But Afterbirth+ introduced what is called "entry points" into the game
As I said, the game itself is in C++
Anyway
That's what you call an introduction to the shit you don't know
before I get a boot to the dick
....actually no I'll just stop stop.
I will stop for now.
everything you said is shit I already know
but
I am
I'm explaining shit to you right now in case you didn't notice
but yeah
I'll stop after that
That's annoying alright ?
Dude
hey there buddy chum pal friend buddy pal chum bud friend fella bruther amigo pal buddy friend chummy chum chum pal i don't mean to be rude my friend pal home slice bread slice dawg but i gotta warn ya if u take one more diddly darn step right there im going to have to diddly darn snap ur neck and wowza wouldn't that be a crummy juncture, huh? do yuo want that? do wish upon yourself to come into physical experience with a crummy juncture? because friend buddy chum friend chum pally pal chum friend if you keep this up well gosh diddly darn i just might have to get not so friendly with u my friendly friend friend pal friend buddy chum pally friend chum buddy...

Then it was remade by Nicalis using C++
So the original BoI was Flash, right
As you wish good sir
nevermind I'll copy/paste
Well alright I can voice if you want
k fam
Doesn't matter, just copy-paste it somewhere
I remember stuff orally more than by text
see me in vc or something
don't explain to me here because I'm gonna fucking forget
Hang on to your ass and read
no
wait wait
Alright no wait let me explain x)
lol
The modding API itself is in Lua, which is mostly what Lua is for
But CPP I can work with.
HEAVILY confused...
I am
The game is not made in Lua, it's C++
and, honestly, despite the fact that rebirth came out in 2014
I'm saying the switch from flash to lua is new
which is, the entire reason Rebirth was made. To make the game easier to work on.
Lua is really not new haha
FURTHERmore, from what I can tell the entire reason Lua is used for Rebirth is because Vanilla OG 2011 The Binding of Isaac ran like shit and barely fucking worked on the development end of things
instead of the PS3
interesting now it does nothing again despite ```local oldstage = -1``` at the start
And you know what, At least none of you assholes have to make a PS3 version of isaac. Edmund is VERY lucky he got to port rebirth to PS4
Just because it's a new language doesn't make it cancerous..I mean, Godot is actually pretty amazing from what I can tell
slight but important differnece ?
secondly, the italicized *but* was just me correcting myseelf.
c# is well designed. lua is cancer
one, *fuck*
No it really, really doesn't xD
if it has a basis in C# I might just need someone to make sprite work for the Pupper mod I talked about earlier
*what else*
It's Lua yeah
*But*
btu
The programming, what language is it?
I know LUA is it's own language, at least, I think it is
then it'll be undefined everywhere else
Alright alright, no offense, just asking
HOLD UP A MINUTE
WAIT
the local will only work in that function
it was at the top before and yeah shit
You know what scope is right ?
Not in another function
I've got a buncha stuff
You need to define your "global" variables at top level
its that its 400 lines long in total
and its not that im not keen on sharing
I changed the definition location to ```function Everything:onUpdate(player)
  if game:GetFrameCount() == 1 then
    --Spawn items in start room
    local oldstage = -```
If you're not keen on sharing, you should definitely be looking for a reason that oldstage or stage isn't being defined.
Also, are you sure you defined oldstage at top level ?
That's easily checkable, replace oldstage with a numerical value and see if the same error still appears
apparently [INFO] - [Everything] Error in PostUpdate call: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/untitled/main.lua:322: attempt to compare nil with number
Throw your code on {p,h}astebin, Caleb.
<@193389830690963457> only thing I can think of is that stage ends up being nil for some reason
I still don't know how to fix this ``` local stage = Game():GetLevel():GetStage()
    if stage > oldstage then```
I imagine that would just make it have no cooldown, though.
It does have that flexibility, yeah. Works either way. Haven't tried Caleb's suggestion.
maybe you need both
I guess RemoveCollectible is good if you want the item to be removed on certain situations, and not on others?
Multiple answers xD
I just checked it
Good call
<@219159380094877696>  maxcharges="0"
Huh
It's an EntityPlayer function.
Is that a top-level function ?
Juse RemoveCollectible the item in your lua function on use.
<@219159380094877696> good question actually, does the items.xml entry for Pandora's Box say anything special ?
One last thing for now, how do I make an active item single-use, aka destroy itself when used?
and not used anywhere else
oldstage
its all lower case
Beware of the case
Check if you didn't initialize a variable named oldStage or something instead
but its initialised on Frame 1
It means that oldstage has never been initialized
that being the latter of the two lines ``` local stage = Game():GetLevel():GetStage()
    if stage > oldstage then```
What's on line 322 ?
i've got this in the log [INFO] - [Everything] Error in PostUpdate call: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/untitled/main.lua:322: attempt to compare nil with number
Or stop trying, should I say
Stop using iiiiit
It's brokeeeeen
FireProjectile from EntityNPC just wont fucking work
Top-level is fine
Make sure your `oldStage` is not modified somewhere else in another function
I can assure you that part is not the problem
I wasn't sure as to whether that part was working
That's ... useless haha
it was like a double check
Also, if `stage > oldstage` then automatically `stage ~= oldstage`
its set to 0 right at the begining of the code
is oldstage initialized properly?
yeah
My bad
kind of
Oh yeah
he did. with oldstage
You need to have a flag that tells you it has already added it once
instead of adding the effect once per floor it does it infinitely
ok, ty
c15 is only the syntax for the command line
can someone is tell me whats wrong with this code ```if player:HasCollectible(ItemId.FMYRRH)then
    local stage = Game():GetLevel():GetStage()
    if stage > oldstage and stage ~= oldstage then
      oldstage = stage;
      local level = Game():GetLevel()
      level:AddAngelRoomChance(ItemBonus.FMYRRH_A)
    end
  end```?
And yeah 15
You have the same variable that serves different purposes depending on the subclass !? You deserve a ticket for programmer hell, my god
not c15?
So if I wanted to grab the ? item, it would be
```Lua
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entities[i].Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE then
          if(entities[i].SubType == 15;
```
If it works but is *that* ugly, it's clearly shit
If it doesn't work, it's not "shit", it's nothing worth talking about
true. But it works, so its slightly less shit
Damn I can't help but cringe
Wow that's full of shit xD
kk ty
check for subtype = yourID
How do I then check the item's ID?
that checks for an item pedestral ya
Looks about right
```Lua
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entities[i].Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE then
```

?
especially the thing with the ProjectileParams
soooo
I think it doesn't
I hear it's broken anyway
ehhh, does anyone know how ENtityNPC:FireProjectile works?
I extract it from an Entity and then use `Entity::Remove()` FWIW
Will it be added to the scene ?
cya
Thanks a lot, see you around
I'll be going now, cy'all
Huh makes sense
<@203215784770535424> About the sprite, just get the Sprite object and use `Sprite:Render` on it
Yeah I got that part
That's well-hidden
ofc for ENTITY_PICKUP aswell
Well damn
check for it ?
<@203215784770535424> PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE is the keyword
xD
well done
<@109624258317033472> oh, just needed to reopen isaac
Explain to my face
Well I'm relieved
^This is why i was confused, I'm sure there should be haha
ofc there is
Pedestal items are the center of everything in this game
Why is there no way to know if an entity is a pedestal item dammit
<@223869207748542464> hm. really no idea ? heres the thread btw: https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mbwj6/editing_stats_with_ab_modding/ maybe it helps
there are a few like BombsSubtypes
because there is non.
I didn't find a specific enum for SubTypes by the way
No idea
SubType*
nothing
item is subvariant or something isnt it?
PICKUP is for everything you pick up, literally
Especially not sure on the `ents[i].Index` bit but that's the closest thing I've found to an ID
I thought PICKUP is for stuff like hearts/coins etc ?
Pretty sure but not sure
```Lua
local ents = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
for i = 1, #ents do
  if ents[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and ents[i].Index == 15 then
    -- do shit
  end 
end
```
hm. looks good to me. Anything in the log?
What is wrong?
```lua
function sugmod:cacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(holyBrimstoneItem) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage * 2 + 2;
    end
  end
end

sugmod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, sugmod.cacheUpdate);
```
and
i have ``cache="damage"`` in items.xml
help
nothing
ok, thx
```XML
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive cache="damage firedelay" description="Dummy Desc!" gfx="Collectibles_Pyrokinesis.png" name="Dummy Item" />
</items>```
Answering to <@219159380094877696> right now
yeah, sorry forgot that
Too many questions
Oh
Hang on hang on
Do i need to set anything in items.xml?
Is there something for specific pedestal items?
Like, checking for a certain item I'd usually use 
```Lua
If Entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_HEART
``` 
etc
<@109624258317033472> 
```lua
function sugmod:cacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(holyBrimstoneItem) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage * 2 + 2;
    end
  end
end
```?
How do I check a table/array of entities from GetRoomEntities() to find a pedestal item, then check if it is item 'c15'?
Without using an Entity, at that
That's not what I wanted, I want to display an already existing (and even running) Sprite
how do I trigger something once per floor
<@126590786945941504> hey so you told me a thing about loading a new ANM2 in a Sprite
thx
jup
?
i need to put that in ``
MOD:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MOD.FUNC)``
ok
```LUA
function dummyMod:cacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    --For some reason the returned player doesn't work, so get it right
    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
    --If isaac has that item
    if player:HasCollectible(dummyMod_item) then
        --Check which stat is being changed. The cacheFlag tells what is being changed.
        --The game will recalculate stats separately, so we only want to add the damage when
        --the damage is being recalculated
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
            --Add the damage from this item
            player.Damage = player.Damage + 2;
        end
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
            --Add the Tear Delay. Can't get it to work though
            player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay - 1;
        end
    end
end``` <- exmaple on how it works, found on reddit ^^
<@229593818691928067> i've sent you the files, please reply to me via PM if you find out why it doesn't work ;-;
stats
what do you mean by chache ?
anyone?!?!
?
guys, how to work with chache
hold on lemme pm you
yea sure
can you show me the file ?
yes
you put challenges.xml in "yourmod/content/challenges.xml" ?
ive tried subscribing to other challenges, and yet they work fine
after i subscribed to my own challenge mod
It's not displaying in my custom challenges list
what's the problem ?
... :/
Shouldn't take long to fix, but I feel like I'm definitely missing something... and I can't find out why.
Hey, is anyone here available to help me with custom challenge troubleshooting right now?
I've made 4 passives, making my first active ?
that changes when you want an passive item, but with active items thats alright
aight, cheers
yeah
you just write what it does?
then you dont need to do any checks in the callback function itself?
ok
blockSpawner is in that cases the item
like: tdMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, tdMod.ItemSpawnBlock, blockSpawner)
you give as last paramter after the function it uses, the item ID
in AddCallback
Or can I pass it through the callback function?
do I have to do a callback for MC_USE_ITEM and then do a check for HasCollectible(myitem)?
I want to do a callback for when my active item is used
that sounds like you got the concept of callbacks wrong. whats your code, and what exactly do you want to achieve?
what?
How do you store the item from an MC_USE_ITEM callback and use it in the callback function?
Okay, for some reason the costume still dosen't appear. I'm fine when I start the run. When I pick up an item I lose my body. And when I enter a new room, I'm using the default isaac walking sprite.
sounds fun :p <@109624258317033472>
XD
i forgot an "end" at the end
I just put AddNullCostume into the CACHE_SPEED if-end thing. Cool thanks.
swap your cache function with this one
```function ferbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED) then
         player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +0.25;
         player:AddNullCostume(Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/hoverboard.anm2"))
    end 

    
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FLYING) then
      player.CanFly = true;
    end
  end```
Cheers m8
let me make some code real quick
So, like in ```if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FLYING)``` then?
you have to give the costume on the cache update
Gonna ask programming then I'mma sleep
<:isaac:257394072933761026>
aye!
ayeverybody!
<@178160616194834432> no idae sorry ^^
on a tower defense mod

Plez. Anyone with any ideas. I start off with my costume, but when I pick up my item, it removes the costume.
nah
secret >_>
what are you working on Scayze ?
the Angel Room Chance
can someone help me with
or post your concept on reddit
the idea sounds cool, but i already have a project im working on. maybe ask around elsewhere ^^
sooo yeha
but without any faith in me I'm basically as fucking useless as the CEO of Sega.
I know how to coordinate ideas, get shit together and organize an idea into reality
you can compare me to Donald Trump
I have no idea how the fuck any of this shit works and I don't have the talent to execute any of my ideas
to be honest, as I've made clear before
uhhh
```local ferbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

Hey what's up guys it's -scarce- ferb here... again. Just need some help with costumes. I start off with my costume, but when I pick up my item, it removes it. Any ideas?
Canine Tooth: applies brimstone.
Upgrade 3: Monstro's lung effect
Upgrade 2: Impliments Rubber Cement into his tears.
Upgrade 1: Spectral Tears.
okay, Base: Bloody tears.
hmm......
you know what I mean?
and instead of a BOOOOOSH it's a BORK THUUM
Which, instead of red will be white
so he can do his laser bork
Maybe that might apply only if you let him get Canine Tooth
He'll gain spectral tears, and eventually on gaining another upgrade will get Brimstone.
but as he gets food, he starts bulking up, not getting fat but gaining more muscle.
and his sprite looks like a mangy ass mutt that ASPCA wants to molest your wallet with
Regular/blood tears at very start
I kinda did
sounds good. but you gotta figure out what exactly he'll get when eating which item
isaac just needs a fucking snuggle.
and to be frank
because I see so many pet items in isaac but there is no living animal friend for isaac to have in the basement
like some sort of Quazi Bumbo that attacks shit for you like Leech and maybe after a few upgrades might start dropping soul hearts or something
sooo
It gets more powerful attacks like a bork laser and shit like that
Basically, think of it as an attacking familiar that starts off with tears but if you give it Dog food related items (Dinner, A Snack, Lunch ECT)
I'm asking around for people interested in programming this thing
It's an item/familiar called Starving Pupper
If that makes sense
Because I could probably get better feedback in the VC channel than with typing
lost to the flow of time I see, I'll re explain it in VC
huh
What's the concept?
Anyone want to go to Modder's chat and talk with me about the concept I brought up earlier today?
I return, finally, so that being said
UH hey
http://i.imgur.com/kPr24OG.png
that's why i kept in my animation a long time before it starts going electrics and stuff
BTW, my tweet is still alive
key mimics but good
¯\_(?)_/¯
So that you're like "Eh it's a key" and you have to stop and look to see that it's a charged key
And, well, it's probably to not make them look too different
mb mb
I just googled "isaac charge key"
not charge
Oooh it's charged
I had no idea what to look for tho
your google-fu is weak
it's on here at the very least
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Keys_(Pickup)#Charged_Keys
Google yields nothing
my bad a pickup yeah
pickup
it's a collectible
Guys, I'm sorry, am I retarded or what, I can't find it on platinumgod
it's ugly af
it's really a key with a pulsing glow to wite
you get it for completing the pokey man challenge, I think
uh
ingame
Is it a mod or what?
a charge key is an item you unlock by finishing the pokey mans challenge
looks like a key with a pulsing glow
gives a battery charge and key for one
brimstone bomb is a lot of fun
What the hell is the charge key?
No, I mean
I really don't get why they did it like that
ok
You can check out Brimstone Bombs if you want help with brimstone
yeah, when i first saw the achievent i was like "that's really cool", then when i saw the actual key, i cried
i want to fire my brim
no, i' not dumb
Charge key?
still, it looks better than what we have now

it's based on the achievement icon tho
thanks
that's pretty cool dude

Check docs for EntityLaser
idk how?!?!?!
But the brimstone itself
You shouldn't be rotating the brimstone sprite
erm
iunno fam
Unless it's Alpha birth?
sould this work?
``BrimBeam:GetSprite().Rotation = 270``
Something <@155169558121021440>  is working on
What is alterbirth or was that a typo
*snort snort*
-snort snort-
Magic
anyone?
guys, how i can rotate the laser that i spawned with ``Isaac.Spawn``?
and more for some reason Jhonen Vasques/Invadel Zim
My artstyle is less Edmund/actually fucking good
I say artwork I mean concept drawing and I would need help with sprites because
well
since i kinda dont do much else but sprites atm
it's that "Someone willing" part doh.
also i could help with sprites if you ever get there
yeh
im pretty sure if you could find someone willing enough to do programming for it, you could make it a reality
How bout it turns the dog into a wolf and the wolf has buffed attack and speed
which is why I'm running the idea by someone who's smart enough to actually do this shit and maybe providing artwork/sound effects
guys, how i can rotate the laser that i spawned with ``Isaac.Spawn``?
I honestly don't know how to do any of this shit
because that shit's really grating
just please dont make it as annoying as the howling sound in afterbirth+ is
yknow, the whole howling/barking when a secret room or a crawl space is in the room
well I actually fucking despise Afterbirth Plus so that could be a thing.
what if having the Starving Pupper gives Dog Tooth detection by default
actually
I still never saw afterbirth ploos
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Dog_Tooth
+
Ah
it's afterbirth
it's not alterbirth
though, I haven't seen Alterbirth
I don't know what Dog Tooth is
and it starts with tears and works it's way up
what if there was something to do with Dog Tooth
Also his borks are his attacks
not for like, per floor/per room
Can he bork
the upgrades last the entire run
But
Also, I had a feeling this could be mis interpeted so
So he's bigger and his attacks are stronker
HE STARTS TINY AND SMALLER THAN ISAAC BUT IF YOU GET BFF/FRIEND BUFFS HE GOES FROM PUPPER TO DOGGO
OH MY GOD I GOT IT
A ghost hot dog
Wonder what we can do to him when you get BFF
oh my god that's funny and awesome
feed him Ghost Pepper and he becomes a Hot Dog
breatfast is op
because, dogs will practically eat anything
But not breakfast
If you want it all foods you can
well I guess
Ok that sounds cool
Was thinking ALL foods but
o
any of the dog food sprite items
Items such as, Lunch, dinner, a Snack
Yes.
ANd Then his sprite goes from like, a mangy mutt butt that looks like the ASPCA giving you a sad handjob to like a healthy happy pupparoo
So it eats food items?
YYYISSS
A Starving Pupper *"Nurture him with love!"*
And maybe if you feed it enough it will start randomly dropping soul hearts/finding soul hearts for you
would be a big balancing factor that makes it a bit more unique than other Bums/Familiars
but the Starving Pupper actually taking your food/health upgrades
true
mm
Because if it picks up/vomits out laser then what you have is amazingness with no counter balance
?
i like that idea
interesting
soo it starts from like spectral tears and then goes up to a brimstone beam and then maybe gets Rubber Cement / 20/20 as it collects more?
and if you let it take it the upgrades the attack it has
and like, a food item like Lunch or something spawns and it goes for it
hi <@81035468866584576>
well I was thinking among the lives of a Starving Puppy in the basement
eeeehhhh.......
maybe it can start with spectral tears and after an upgrade it goes up to brimstone
i was thinking, what if it ate pickups and then vomitted them out in the form of a laser
And then it upgrades its attack
In that, you give this thing your health upgrades (Lunch, Dinner, any food item)
uh
oh
Hi !
how about a combination of a floating familiar such as Baby Brimstone to a collect/upgrade familiar like BumBo
well actually I wanted to discuss a mod idea for shits and giggles
I'm kinda new here too, though I usually frequent the spriting channel.
Tank you
Welcome to the Modding of Isaac Discord!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuz85lWtql4
Hello everyone, big isaac fan that saw the discord and went OH GOD ALL OF MY YES
neato
Oh I can type?
There you go!
Thanks!

@KubeRoot#1951 ?
: I kind of goofed up a texture within my resources folder, can anyone send me their "character_001_isaac.png" file?
I'm not sure why that is...
the code
I've been trying to make a few, but they're not showing up in my game.
can i pm you?
Is anyone here familiar with how custom challenges work?
nothing in log
Also, this bit of code looks fine, I'd have to see the rest
Have you checked log.txt?
all other code is gud
ItemCharge is not setting to 0
just
i am trying to do charge for custom brim
I don't know the rest of your code
¯\_(?)_/¯
why?
`ItemCharge ~= player.MaxFireDelay * 3` seems oddly specific
?
why this is not setting ItemCharge to 0
i have this
```lua
        if player:GetFireDirection() > -1 and ItemCharge ~= player.MaxFireDelay * 3 then
         ItemCharge = ItemCharge + 1
        else
          ItemCharge = 0
        end
```
you can use it to check for multiple conditions at the same time
hahah
just how it works?
how "and" works in lua?
I'm not too keen on how that bit works
I'm not 100% sure how it works
I have it at math.random(1) == 1 for testing
it works now
I haven't done that myself so I don't really know, but I'd think the game would already do that
Also are you sure you're supposed to be bitshifting by the curse ID?
If it's a bitmask
No, it surely would be 0
if thereis no Curse then surely it would return nil
Then how are you expecting this to work if it's never going to be nil?
pls
I don't thats just to see if it returns something
in the start
\``` lua
Why do you expect Curses to be nil?
there we go
```local frailId = 1 << Isaac.GetCurseIdByName("Curse of the Frail") - 1
function Everything:CurseEval(Curses)
  if Curses == nil then
    if math.random(1) == 1 then
      return Curses | frailId
    else
      return Curses
    end
  end
end
function Everything:CurseDamage()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if game ~= nil then
    curses = game:GetLevel():GetCurses()
    if (curses & frailId) ~= 0 then
      if player:GetTotalDamageTaken() ~= nil then
        if player:GetSoulHearts() ~= 0 then
          player:AddSoulHearts(-1)
        else
          player:AddHearts(-1) 
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
No, the top-right of the window
-.-
that
~
at the top
press the pin thingy
how do i put it in that code box thing
Post code
oh, i didn't know about that
<@126590786945941504> that doesn't apear to work either
It's right there in the enums ;_;
thx for -1
i know
If you need to get direction when controls are disabled, use the Joystick methods
thx
-1
oh
Always returns -1 if controls are disabled
It returns a direction enum
how ``player:GetFireDirection()`` work?
guys
Then **why the hell don't you use that to check for curses?**
It's the assigned value of the curse which in turn is then whats used for the Curse of x in game
What do you think the `Curses` argument is for?
First of all
Well
how do I go about that
ah ok
You need to get an instance
`Level` is the class itself
`Level` isn't an instance of Level
ah ok
Also, it doesn't returna  nil value, the function itself is nil from the error

What's your exact code?
there is one
You need a Level instance
dude
the same applies for GetCurseName() which is supossed to return a string
[INFO] - [Everything] Error in PostCurseEval call: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/untitled/main.lua:85: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetCurse')
everytime I use it it returns a nil value
uh isn't it in bits
Does the Level.GetCurse() work? if so how does it work
Sorry, Im back lads
end me
i'm dumb
o
End of File
eof?
The code isn't even valid Lua, you should have an "expected 'end' near EOF" in your log D:
ok
sorry
ok
Mook, learn to read the damn log.txt
They're not even nested
what
No, wait
Wait, those are nested
and, uh
You need to add both functions as cache updates or make them into one function
Well, mook
well
lol
excellent! alright mook, disregard my previous advice.
im so confused
2 cache update functions 1 callback?
what*
whay
It should print a number after `Lua Debug:` IIRC
Then run the mod and check log.txt?
I hope it doesn't need to be in there that would be a waste ?
Can you put `Isaac.DebugString(Grill)` just before `MyMod:AddCallback`?
let me try it with it outside
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  
  local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = Player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = Player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
<@116386733905412105> Nope, you don't, that'd make no sense
Well, show your entire code I guess
yeah nothing is happening though
pretty sure you need the item definition inside the cache call
Yeah, that'll work
You can reload the mod by either restarting the game, going into the mods menu and turning it off and back on or running `luamod dirname` in the console
also i'm exiting the game each time if that counts as reloading
ok
And don't put `circketsCollar_item` inside the function
You are reloading the mod everytime, right?
o
Also
I mean EatMeReturns
i don't have it anymore
i'm not
noTHIN
Why are you still including `local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`?
dude
ok did the thing
turn this:
```lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
```

in to this:
```lua
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
```
huh
move the definition of cricketsCollar_item inside of your cacheupdate function
ah
whenever i pick up the item no damage or speed is given to me
and what is the issue you're having?
it says can't find warn or err
search for "warn" or "err"
hastebin pls
no
should i put the part of log.txt i'm about to paste in ```this```
this is going to be a long read
also, protip, speed doesn't go over 2.0
Check your log.txt
<@223869207748542464>  ey
```<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/">
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
 <passive cache="damage speed" name="Cricket's Collar" description="Bork" gfx="cricketscollar.png" />
</items>```
how does items.xml look
still don't get any effects
nothing changed
And hello saxarok
Unless somebody can give me a reason to have that line in the code, I'm going to complaing about it because sorry, but that looks like just awful codding
hi
ok
Remove the `local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`
ok
after both ends
where's the callback at?
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local cricketsCollar_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item) then
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        player.Damage = Player.Damage + 1;
    end
      if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
        player.MoveSpeed = Player.MoveSpeed + 1.50;
    end
  end
  end
```
The only reason is that the player **used to** be corrupted, so you had to do `Isaac.GetPlayer(player.Index)`
go figure lol
so let's get our own player
function takes player
code could be more efficient but Lua is so lightweight it doesnt matter
http://i.imgur.com/MmKizQo.png
Why do people even do that
***WHAT THE FUCK***
```LUA
 function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
   local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
   if player:HasCollectible(cricketsCollar_item)  then
     if  cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
       player.Damage = Player.Damage + 1
     end
     if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
       player.MoveSpeed = Player.Movespeed + 1.50;
     end
   end
end```
I'd also recommend learning Lua before you start modding, but ¯\_(?)_/¯
Honestly, I'd recommend just looking at the sample mods
*Lua
well fuck i'm an idiot i know what you mean by "you have to check which flag it is" now
oh
I haven't used LUA before this
i probably should have learned even a bit of lua before doing this
let me bake some code dx
ok to be honest i'm not well versed in lua or anything in general so i have no idea what you mean by "you have to check which flag it is"
something like cricketsCollar_item would be acceptable
oh
variables dont have spaces or special characters
also
you have to check which flag it is
tbh don't know what i did wrong but yeah
```LUA
 local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
  local Cricket's Collar = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Cricket's Collar")

  function MyMod:Cacheupdate(player, cacheFlag)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(Cricket's Collar) then
      player.Damage = Player.Damage + 1;
      player.MoveSpeed = Player.Movespeed + 1.50;
```
i'm not getting any speed or  damage bonuses
buuut
so items.xml is fine and the item is showing up when i do spawn.5.100.512
+1 damage, +1.50 speed
what does the item do?
ye
remember to check if the player even has the collectible
no new fuctions for passives
yes
what
i feel like i should but i'm making sure
do i add the cricket's collar shit after the ending of the first item i made in main.lua or no
p a i n
Why does this not work? I redid all of the amm2s, I changed the directories; and it still wont work...
I looked at it now, looks fine to me
I gotta take it one step at a time
this is getting annoying
i'm gonna take that no response to my question as a yes
Along with the other joystick that I forgot the name of
That works even when controls are disabled
Oh, `EntityPlayer:GetMovementJoystick()`
how'd you get the inputs
inputs
no but
what'd you use
It's not entities
The piece is just a table with a sprite and fake sprites in it that I draw at the right place
the tetris pieces
also does this look right
<@128874748041101312> What do you mean by "make the things move"?
yes
_"Bork"_
Not yet, but I have the check in place
what should the description of cricket's collar be
do you get killed if it goes to the top?
hm
Because I was on a bad streak and didn't want to fuck up completely
neat
ha
I was scared I wouldn't get another one
Oh, that one
If yes, that's when I fucked off because I actually had to rerecord the footage and decided to end it in case it got corrupted
roughly center I think
Is it near the end of the video?
why tho
why did you put that white piece there?
I was trying desperately to get 4 rows at once
Shut up, you haven't seen my skills
like _boi_
how'd you make the things move
<@126590786945941504> your bad at tetris
What is it?
no
<@126590786945941504> you know your tetris
oh
<@!267112861921181697> And that's *roughly* correct, that's what I was going for, but I decided to consider all suggestions
I'm so confused
The question looked hilarious
why am i such an idiot
/s
***do i just press enter once if i want to make tetris?***
just make a new line
7 people asked you to make it n arcade thiung
do i just press enter once if i want to add a new item to items.xml
again
goddamn is broke
*7 and counting...*
<@126590786945941504> you could a new machine in the arcade that lets you play when you put a coin in it
neat
Top-right is where the next piece will be shown
Bottom-right is where isaac will be placed
oh
The frame is placeholder
Layout planning
<@126590786945941504> what are the red boxes for?
neat
I found bogo bombs
that's as much as I can guess tho
sure maybe
in items.xml
maybe bread will add a new tag
well currently as far as i know it doesn't work with mod items
Yes, that's tetris, here's a video (again) https://streamable.com/ra0ls
only works after you find an item for the first time
as an optional hud
If you don't know, Edmund is adding the Item Descriptions mod in the next booster pack
is that tetris???
For the sprite
say what ?
Thanks to <@!146070361929154560> http://i.imgur.com/eRknC3G.png
how are mods gonna work with description mod when Edmund adds it?
I won't be spoiling mine.
feels good to do something on my own
should mods spoil what they do ?
Yes, that was the issue
is tormenting the commentors making them figure out what the items do
the best part about making these mods
still haven't downloaded that mod because i'm lazy
oh hey kyozm
ayeverybody
maybe the amm2 are still referencing the pngs from the other mod.. that's probs the issue
it aight
hueh i barely know how to do this stuff so can't help you there pal
up above. if you care.
Decent, combating a character screen issue.
how are you
hello!
hey y'all
sorry if this seems naggy, but I checked all the xml fields and main fields and nothing specifies the other mod.
Hey, I am having an issue. For some reason, my character code is working... decent, but the xml only grabs sprites from the mod that I took it from. Is that a bug, or is there something I need to change?
Wait what? There isn't the name tag thing in the custom player thing
I nothing but the character sprite names and it suddenly doesn't work?
Hm... I am confused here...
<@!124170727225163776> post a pic?
Resprite?
My larry Jr sprite is fucked, what do i do
oh
<@197024269685882880> AFAIK `EntityPlayer.MaxFireDelay` is currently bugged
Well, you can try to get the entity, get the sprite, load another anm2 or spritesheet and, well, done
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5o55er/how_to_do_tears_up/
Like, you know how the spear of destiny is a sword in the Guardian challenge? Is it possible to attach that effect to a character and reskin a familiar?
Is what you want just a costume?
"alternate skins" of what?
Just saying, I know I literally just said I would ask less questions, but is it possible to make alternate skins, like in the Guardian challenge?
Well, if you want somebody less rude, I can let others help you, sorry ¯\_(?)_/¯
That'd be a separate type
That wouldn't be "just reskinned"
I'm trying my best here and I'm just asking for help
ok dude there's no need to be rude
like an entity.Subtype = PICKUP_TAROTCARD means it's a card but not a rune
Have you been paying any attention?
This is confusing because you'd think runes would just be reskinned tarot cards
As in, RUNE_SOMETHING
Because the cards are SubTypes as far as I know
Are you talking about Index, Type, Variant or SubType?
What ID do you want though?
just entity.ID?
i assume that's easier
how do you check an entities IDs?
You can even make it autogenerate based on `Card` keys, when they contain `RUNE`
If you don't want that, you can make a lookup table
So if you just check if the ID is between the smallest rune and the highest, that'll work
The runes have consecutive IDs, it would seem
You can check for a range
do I have to check for each individual rune?
`Card.RUNE_HAGALAZ`
*ahem*
and there's no PICKUP_RUNE
This said, the check still doesn't work for runes
it works fine
i was just asking for that specific thing
```                if (entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP) and (entity.Variant ~= PICKUP_PILL) and (entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_TAROTCARD) and entity.FrameCount == 1 and entity:GetSprite():IsPlaying('Appear') and ((Duplication[i] == 1) or (Duplication[i] == 0)) and math.random(4) == 1 then
```
The full line is
Because types, variants and subtypes are all just numbers
Otherwise you're gonna get false positives
And variant, assuming subtype worked
Thanks to anyone who helped me unironically, gonna kill myself now. Cya.
You also have to check for entity type
I mean doing `PICKUP_TAROTCARD = PickupVariant.PICKUP_TAROTCARD`
Nope
if that's what you mean by define it somewhere else
Maybe I worded it badly - I was just asking what type of thing to check for when using pills. For context this is within a loop of checking all entities in the room under the name "entity"
So you either didn't post exact code, or you're defining `PICKUP_TAROTCARD` elsewhere
`PickupVariant.PICKUP_PILL` is
`PICKUP_PILL` is not defined in enums.lua
*sigh*
entity.Variant ~= PICKUP_TAROTCARD
I was asking whether to do entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_PILL where it should have been
I dunno why I didn't just try that before asking lol
I checked and it turns out it totally is a variant
Dude
I know?
That code snippet **HEAVILY** relies on other code
What?
Because either you copypasted without reading or solved problems by doing random stuff
Well, you need to reread your code
but if i do "entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_PILL" it doesn't
if I do "entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_TAROTCARD" it works on tarot cards
I mean obviously there's tons more code but in the check for when to do things
Then you need to read the rest of it
If that's your actual code
Erm
what
Are pills a variant or something?
Hey, is there a reason "entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_TAROTCARD" correctly checks for tarot cards but "entity.SubType ~= PICKUP_PILL" doesn't check for pills?
for player portraits in the tutorial thing its  in there
I'd think the correct folder for that is `resources`, but I'm not sure
¯\_(?)_/¯
is right?
Wanted to be sure ^^
Yeah ok that's what I thought
There's all casts except for ToTear
<@249974366106943489> As far as I know, that's the current problem
I have death portraits
Hey ! I want to modify tears that Isaac just fired, so I loop over the room entities to get those which have the ENTITY_TEAR type but I get an Entity object and not an EntityTear object, so I can't use BaseDamage or other attribute. Any idea ?
you need death portraits
miana skoais
senpai pls
I edited it but it wont work
nicalis sample mods
<@128874748041101312>
Yes
Is s/he online?
Swift knows how to do it IIRC
hmmm
help, I cant get my character to show up in the UI
hec
so noone knows how to do that? ;_; dammit
<@203215784770535424> You can `Load` another anm2 file from the sprite or `ReplaceSpritesheet` with a png
oh shit I was away
bye
bon voyage!
See you guys around
RIP that
Welp gotta go for now
someone knows how to remove a custom costume that has been added via AddNullCostume() ?
Can I spawn an entity with a given Sprite ?
Also dammit there's no SetSprite
Why the fucking fuck did I not buy eyes when I could
`Entity:GetSprite()`
erm
Also why the fucking fuck does Entity not have a Sprite exposed
Daaaamn
guys, it's happening http://i.imgur.com/zfEAtVx.png
And oh-so-fortunately it's the same name for every door opening animation
Which makes sense
Well I now know it's called "Open"
Where each square is 16x16
Like, say, a mega maw for the 2x2 for example
Anybody wants to sprite 16x16 isaac-themed tetris blocks?
Also, since I decided to post the video...
finally there's a way to play tetris
Does somebody know the name of the animation that the doors play when opening ?
What ?
devil deal fucks that
oh yeah
I want to be an angel
wow haha I wasn't expecting tetris
so many lost points...
Gameception
Hahaha WTF
rude
you are really bad at tetris

**The pact is sealed.** You are now a <@&207206454992568320> :smiling_imp:
I want to be a demon
Also you need 3 items
Say "I want to be a demon"

Busy with something else, sorry
Halp please?

``` Hello again! Still having trouble getting my costume to work so...
i will wait...
the angels will stay pure
yes
ha ha ha HAA
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
i want to be angel
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
will be angel
ok
you can still be an angel though
and they were both isaac.
oh
were you the one who made that petition ?
no angles ?
wat
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
i want to be an angle
I FOUND 3RD ITEM!
GUYS
OH
i removed the id in metadata.xml
why ?
you'll be my victim then
but u can't update it for me
i have that mod
i control the mind of a 1000 people !
i could update the mod an change the intro of the game to whatever i want...
nearly 1000 subscribers to your mod nice
they seem to do well on the workshop ^^
a shitmod ?
it's sort of a shitpost
the Isaac of Isaac thing
what's yours?
well my mod blew up on the workshop lol
take a look at 006.004_beggar.anm2
Prize
Does anyone know the animation name for the key/greed bum to drop an item ?
Noice
I have subscribers for my mod.
Hoorah!
Which you can't get, so that's RIP
That's the worst part, some functions expect an entire object, not just an ID
And `Isaac` only gives IDs
no but even Config is nil right ?
In the Config namespace I mean
hey man the Vector class works great
Well seeing that no class has a constructor ...
isn't the whole Config thing inaccessible
Oh. Well that's good...
You can't even instantiate it
How the fuck do you get a `Config::Item` object
Now the problem is
Which is not what you're doing
You need to give it a `Config::Item` object
Also this still isn't enough
item is still not working
On me because I have the IQ of that of a potato
life
You're not supposed to use AddNullCostume but AddCostume
on what ?
I give up
```lua
local ferbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")
local hoverBoard.COSTUME_HOVERBOARD = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/hoverboard.anm2")

function ferbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED) then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +0.25;
    end
    
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FLYING) then
      player.CanFly = true;
    end
  end
  Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(hoverBoard)
  end
  ferbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, ferbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
How do I costume. Trying to add a costume to Isaac but ```lua Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(hoverBoard)``` seems to break it.
And that'll work
yeas
Then you need `function MyMod:use_faith(item, rng)`
I assume you use that as a MC_USE_ITEM callback
what are the params for rng
<@!267112861921181697> ^
Also `AddHearts, AddSoulHearts` and `AddBlackHearts` are methods, so they need the `:` operator
You use `rng` without having it as a parameter
for some reason this isn't working
```function MyMod:use_faith( )
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.95 then
        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player.AddHearts(2)
        player.AddSoulHearts(1)
        player.AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```
I need help with some of my code3
Oh
download fasterrrrr
I just want ot fucking play overwatch you cunt
i found brimston anm2
yeah!
And by "not sure" I mean no idea
Alsoooo not sure how to make a `Config::Item` out of an ID
It's `Config::Item` though so I don't know if it works
<:isaac_eyebrow:245063314613338113>
The `Item` class has a `Costume` member
shite
fucking update
Hang on
e
gonna play overwatch by
Wait, so how do I fix it?
It's like you did `2.COSTUME_HOVERBOARD = 10`
yeah, your getting the ID
<@178160616194834432> `Hoverboard` is a number
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=843022909 here guys, please comment to agree not to support that stealing cunt.
<@109624258317033472> Ok thanks i'll try !
Hey look! I've stumbled across another problem in my program!
```lue
local ferbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

--Hoverboard.COSTUME_HOVERBOARD = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/hoverboard.anm2")

function ferbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED) then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +0.25;
    end
    
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FLYING) then
      player.CanFly = true;
    end
  end
  
  end
  ferbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, ferbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
I'm trying to give Isaac a costume, but the tutorial I followed dosen't work. The commented out part is the thing that breaks the program. I'm not sure if I need it. I also *accidently* deleted the thing that adds the costume to isaac himself.
how did you get Demon ranks?
RIP
that moment when you accidentally open an image in photoshop and takes forever to load ;-;
Why you gotta have so few classes, everything is so bloated
Maaaan that suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
Also, there's no Item class ? Everything is via EntityPickup ?
That's not right
no charge anm2 file... time to make one!
<@249974366106943489> you could alway check if the player suddenly has an item more of desired pickup and trigger your event then
btw thanks to Yusyuriv#4287 for that one
<@120547369761767428> well. Costume:IsSkinAlt() is only accessible by the class Config isnt it?
you can check distance between isaac and pickup
no
<@109624258317033472> sorry, but I'm not really sure what you mean, forgive me
So without a PICKUP_ITEM callback i'm screwed ?
still
no
last i checked it was unusable
I think the price is just the graphic
<@120547369761767428> is the Config class correct implemented finally?
Hi! When I change the attribute Price of an EntityPickup (in the shop), the price change visually but remains the same when I buy the item ! Any idea ?
I'll just leave it for now
or not... it's identical
ok
Oh yeah surely
yeah, the only thinkg steven has is the hasSkinAlt = "true". Maybe it needs to be set up in the anm2 file
i guess its one of the thousend anm2 files
i really don't know
Oh like that
yes
<@223869207748542464> charge anim?
no
<@223869207748542464> you mean fire a Brimstone shot ?
I guess you just gotta do what Steven does in its own <item> tag
how i can display brimstone anim?
I see
but has steven_black, steven_green etc.
the item steven for example has a different costume for each skin colour, so it won't be pink all the time
<@203215784770535424> it means if you pick an item that changes skin colour (say abaddon) the costume won't be isaac's regular skincolour, but the new skin colour
I've never used costumes (not yet)
What's that supposed to do ?
Wof said he will keep an eye on bob
<@109624258317033472> damn, I guess I'll leave it for now
search Idubbbz nickanme
<@120547369761767428> no idea, never tried
more than one result. Damn. you gotta guess
in regards to costumes
Where is that ?
sorry to interrupt this drama, does anyone know if 'hasSkinAlt="true"' is working at the moment?
It makes him invisible because it stole his code
and it kills isaac
I should make an item called "Bob's Butthole"
^
1 result
dick"
floppy
"Big
Search bar
haha
search for "Ass"
I know Bob's Brain :E
Does anyone know Bob's steam?
Yeah that too
I just want other people to know
And we do too
just upload your mod to the workshop before he does, and then call his ass out.
yeah
Now you know to not trust him again
messaged wolf see if he will do anything about this
It's alright x)
fucking damnit
I viss i vas allowd to maek a peehessay abut dis
that sounded retarded
this*
I wish I was allowed to make a PSA about dis
fair enough ?
Not he was one
I only said he had one
Spriter for axe mod
an ass didnt you read?
No idea
who even is Bob
he seemed nice at first, but nobody disclose any mod ideas or code to him
lol
^ sounds legit
Kill his ass
k
He might be an ass, but theres nothing you can do about that
Well, sucks to be bob then
sucks to be you
well.
but I didn't upload it
if you uploaded it to the workshop and he used the exac same code, thats indeed not allowed
I gave them some code and showed them my other items and they kicked me a day later
oh lol
yesa
you mean they keep your code but don't allow you to use the sprites?
so yes they are
But I already coded them
yes but ideas aren't subject to copyright
s
But he stole my idea
¯\_(?)_/¯
Well you literally can't use his sprites if he says you can't use his sprites
he made me some sprites in exchange for some items
Bob
this shit always happens
whose sprites?
I will never work with other people from this day on
Why the fuck did they make it so obvious imo
I am not just gonna stop using the sprites if they are blatently stealing ideas
<@!267112861921181697> well that sucks ass
i know how to that then
ok
<@223869207748542464> only with hackiness i guess
when I asked all he said was I couldn't use the sprites
and they kicked me
I had school one day
fucking cunts
kicked me and said I couldn't use sprites that were already made
Is it possible to make item charge like brimstone?
I am pretty fucking sure Bob's modding team just stole all of my items
or do i have to do it manually with a custom table by entity Indexes and shit?
is there any good way in lua to save data for an entity?
Last one being Abducted, it's in the SoundCloud description
I have a couple Youtube playthroughs of some songs if you're interested too
2H9TK22Z
I appreciate that a lot
Thanks a lot for the follow Scayze o/
That's one of the new rare rooms I assume
that room gotta be rare ? holy damn
i can give you seed
yes
oO did this happen on a regular isaac run?
oh. A buddy forgot to log out from his Soundcloud account on my PC ? guess who is following you now xD
Guys...
I still like them as history but they sound much worse than the current latest 3 songs
xD ok.
Thanks ^^ don't be scared by the sudden quality drop starting Twin Fates though, that was before I got a producer to mix and master shit haha
I found a bassist just a couple days so that should be good, and I still need a drummer
nice. ? dude. those tracks are really great. i know what ill be listeing to now :p
I record every guitar track, I write and program drums (nothing to record drums here, and I can't play most of the songs anyway haha) and when possible I record bass
wait. so you did everything, not only the guitar or what? oO
Why thank you ^^
dude. thats fucking amazing.
I don't do any reposts
Yeah, everything I post is tracks I record
? you did that?!? how cool is that!
It does right ? Hahaha
I'm a metal guitarist
god. its kinda disturbing how good that song fits with isaacs theme
It's me who does the playin' of the things o/
yeah. Infant Annihilator!
Start with that haha
https://soundcloud.com/matrefeytontias
sounds good!
I'll bring beer and death metal
Fuck yeah
welcome to the dark side then!
A dozen minutes ago
Just now
? when did you become a demon, <@203215784770535424>
Hahaha what's up <@216324079504982016>
Im sorry robo baby o.0
wow
And it's 3 lines of actually useful code haha
It got requested to me
It disables the bosses' death animation so the doors open faster
what is it? ?
I think I made what could be one of the shortest yet useful mods
Nice o/
got it sorted thanks ?
oh derp
Quit the game and run it again ?
keeps doing this xD
I'm not sure what needs to be done to refresh this
Try disabling the mod, exiting the mods menu, then going back to it and enabling it again
still does that o.o
ok
Remove the "id=" field altogether
Try not giving it any
also tried 0
gave it the id 1
Did you give an ID to your challenge in challenges.xml ?
Alright alright
also any clue as to why I have a blank challenge 1? xD
deciding if I should put it on a timer rather then a room enter, but it works now ?
*tinkers a bit more*
Thank me when you're sure it works x)
No problem
thank you ?
There you go ?
`if Isaac.GetChallenge() == Isaac.GetChallengeIdByName("your challenge") then`
Oh well
Use that along with `Isaac.GetChallengeIdFromName()` and you're good
There's a function to check if you're in a challenge
now to enable this only on the challenge
ok cool got it to work
No problem
thanks
mb
searched through ENtityType enum
It is yeah
its an familiar
oh right
Yeah as I said
nono. the actual entity
You can just spawn it as a familiar or give yourself the item
The Punching Bad item ?
What do you mean ?
cant find it in the enums
Does anyone know how to spawn an punching bag?
Honestly I have no idea how stat multipliers work
Although I'm not sure that's gonna work for a multiplier
Even better, get that out of there into a MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback
You should evaluate items first, then multiply
thx
oh yes
Well then the stats thing can't work
yes
Also I assume that's a MC_POST_UPDATE ?
Remarks on code, that is
I thought I had proven to you that my remarks are worthy of attention dammit
?
Don't dude me x)
ok
oh
dude
cryingHeartItem_delay
It's supposed to be a global variable
all my passive items don't work
Also your crying heart can't work since you define crying_heart_delay in the same block as you use it
but it's OP
If you want my opinion
Also, shooting blue flies kinda sucks because no combo does anything now
Nothing happens at all ?
still nothing
and forgot about that
One line, one problem xD
i was just doing stuff
oh wow
xD
oh
```Lua
playerPos = player.Position
player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
```
the order though
what doesnt work?
```lua
function sugmod:Items_effect()
playerPos = player.Position
player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

-- lordOfFlies passive
  if player:HasCollectible(lordOfFlies) then
    player:AddCacheFlags(Firerate)
    player.FireDelay = player.FireDelay * 1.5
    player:EvaluateItems()
    local entities2 = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i2 = 1, #entities2 do 
      local e2 = entities2[i2];
      if e2.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and e2.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then 
        FireFly = player:AddBlueFlies(1, playerPos, player) 
        e2:Remove()
      end
    end
  end

-- Crying Heart Passive
  if player:HasCollectible(cryingHeartItem) then
    local cryingHeartItem_delay = 0
    cryingHeartItem_delay = cryingHeartItem_delay + 1 --Adds +1 to delay
    if cryingHeartItem_delay == 4 then --Check if delay is equal to max delay
      cryingHeartItem_delay = 0
      player:FireTear(playerPos, Vector(math.random(-4, 4), math.random(-4, 4)), false, false, false) --Spawn tear
    end
  end
end
``` this doesn't work
and it happens outside of the challenge for obvious reasons
At least now it's working ?
That's because you need a flag that tells you that you spawned them already
Well yeah
XD
or something
well now it spawns them every frame
I'm not sure how Lua works regarding that
I'm not sure if that's important, but maybe TheLocust.onUpdate isn't defined yet when you reach the `AddCallback` line
Instead of the beginning
<@142664257027309568> try putting the `AddCallback` line at the end of the file
well at least you can kinda understand what I want right?
Haha
yay for discord!
the  formating is a fucking eyesore
its a mess T_T
\`\`\`Lua
all of your code here
\`\`\`
Like that
```Lua
local TheLocust = RegisterMod( "TheLocust", 1 )

TheLocust:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,TheLocust.onUpdate)


function TheLocust:onUpdate()
    for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
        
            if Game():GetRoom():IsFirstVisit()                     
                then     Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_WRATH, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_DEATH, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_PESTILENCE, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_FAMINE, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_CONQUEST, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
            end
        end
    end
```
there\
No, not every line
\```
ccode
\```
like this?
What did I say about surrounding it xD
```local TheLocust = RegisterMod( "TheLocust", 1 )

TheLocust:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,TheLocust.onUpdate)


function TheLocust:onUpdate()
    for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
        
            if Game():GetRoom():IsFirstVisit()                     
                then     Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_WRATH, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_DEATH, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_PESTILENCE, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_FAMINE, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_CONQUEST, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
            end
        end
    end```
So we can fix it
Which is why I'm asking you to paste it haha
Im so shy since it look horrid
And surround it with :
\`\`\`Lua
code here
\`\`\`
Paste the code here please
Maybe it's because it has an error in it
xD
whatever I do to my mod it seems nothing is happening
ok I am at a loss completely
?
lol
i'm so stupid
oh
you missed player:AddBlueFlies
oh
anything showing up in the log?
xD
```lua
  if player:HasCollectible(lordOfFlies) then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do 
      local e = entities[i];
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and e.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER then 
        FireFly = AddBlueFlies(1, playerPos, player) 
        e:Remove()
      end
    end
  end
```
my code isn't working at all now
<@223869207748542464> i guess yeah. Did it work? ^^
So you don't spawn trinkets on every frame
Also, hold a flag to ensure your function has only been called once
To check for that, see if `Game():GetLevel():GetAbsoluteStage() == LevelStage.STAGE1_1` and if `Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoomIndex() == Game():GetLevel():GetPreviousRoomIndex()`
Yeah that's what I meant
it only needs to happen at the start
```lua
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  playerPos = player.Position

FireFly = AddBlueFlies(1, playerPos, player);
```?
Yeah haha
*is tearing through other mods looking at structure*
Only if you're in the first room of the first floor though
Yes
So I would add something like "nameofmod":AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT,"function that spawns the items")
Probably but why though haha
^^
err. i dont know
nvm
is there a way to do it using Isaac.Spawn?
in EntityPlayer
Entity &     AddBlueFlies (integer Amount, Vector Position, Entity Target)
that blue fly
guys, how to spawn frienly fly
Yep
this is a thing I would write down in the main.lua right?
Which is good, because that means you can write a little function to spawn stuff when starting your challenge
Yeah so it's a normal Lua mod
Nah it's fine
*hates that second preview line* xD
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835061601
Can you link to it ?
following a steam guide on making challenges atm tbh ^^' very new with this
Not a Lua mod
You're packaging your custom challenge in a mod to the game files, correct ?
Then you probably have to use Lua yes
Oh, okay
want them to be specific though ?
Forgot its name for some reason
I guess another way around it would be to give that one item that spawns a trinket and gives a health up
If it's possible without, I don't kow how
Hum yeah ^^'
*figures he has to dive into that then* ?
Assuming you are using Lua
You can add a MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT callback and spawn your trinkets there
good morning and thanks^^
mornin, and mornin to you Scazye
heya, I am working on a custom challenge and I would like the player to start out with more then one trinket (ok with them dropping at the start). Is there a way to do this without chaning the starting room for anything but the challenge?
Hi
Hello
god morning everyone ^^
oh yeah that makes sense :/
You would think that you can't do anything pertaining to donations with a mod
So you can't donate when using a mod
But actually it makes no sense because achievements are disabled when mods are enabled
Only one way to find out
Maybe that's it
i saw a getDonationModAngel but im not sure
<@235104838550159361> I think I saw something in Game or Level
oh =c
<@231479486057676801> no way
Lol, unused room
How to download mod in the website without gives his steam account ? ?
That's not right
Which means that when a boss dies, `boss:State` is 18 which is ... off bounds ?
Hey guys , does anyone of you know how to get the current shop donation machine count ?
Hum so NpcState.STATE_DEATH is actually 17
Haha nice
Bug?
https://streamable.com/s6o6b
And 18 is NpcState.STATE_DEATH, that makes sense
There is indeed an enum called that
Ooooh it's NpcState, makes sense
FWIW it's 18 when bosses are in their dying animation
It says it's just an integer, but it's definitely from some enum
Does anybody know what goes into EntityNPC::State ?

Agoraphobia - "DON'T COME NEAR ME !"
Within reasonable limits haha
The farther you are, the harder you hit
The closer you are to an enemy, the faster you go
Like, bonus damage as a function of the distance, and bonus speed as a function of the inverse of the distance
1 is exactly as many items as it takes to run out of any ideas
Bonus damage if far of every enemy !
bonus damage if in a corner, claustrophobia or something
Gave me an idea for an item
It's more commonly referred to as the latter
Agoraphobia is fear of lack of cover, and by extension fear of crowded places
Oh yeah makes sense haha
so it suited ;D
glossophobia is public speaking, and i have a fear of it that makes me cry
Yet it's not exactly that
More like agoraphobia
like bonus damage based on enemies in room = Glossophobia
It's unbelievable
Also my god, you have to do so much crap to force-clear a room
The problem I have is finding cheeky names and descriptions for them
I'd say round it to 5's.
haha
I'll probably aim for 35 for first release i guess
It makes sense though ?
hahaha that change
Then exactly as many items as it takes for you to run out of relevant ideas
That makes sense
I wanna publish a mod 'pack'
I've already made 4 haha
I don't know, one ? ?
How many items should I make before I publish my first mod? ^_^
Hey what's up ?
Hai!
Hi!
Let's try and see I guess
My assumption is that when you call `door:Open()` on challenge rooms with your health not meeting the criterias, it closes itself right back
I have yet to try that
Shit behaves weird sometimes, like challenge rooms
```Lua
function isToOpen(door)
    local variant = door:GetVariant()
    return variant == DoorVariant.DOOR_LOCKED_BARRED or variant == DoorVariant.DOOR_UNLOCKED and not door:IsLocked()
end
```
Alright, so I have determined the line that tells me whether or not a room has to be opened when a room is cleared
It doesn't seem to be the case
Hence my question
Like, needed a key or something
Which worries me, because then there's no way of telling if a door that wasn't barred and got barred was locked or not before that
To check if a door is barred, you do `door:GetVariant() == DoorVariant.DOOR_LOCKED_BARRED`
But that's not the question x)
Not to see if it is
That's the function to bar a door
On the first glance, isn't `GridEntityDoor:Bar()` exactly what you ask?
Or are there other instances of barred doors ?
Right ?
So there can't be a barred locked door, since there can't be a locked door in a mini-boss's room
Doors become barred when fighting a mini-boss
Can a locked door be barred ? Is that possible ?
I have a doubt
3 items fully completed now, in only 6 hours haha
Found out how to make item stacking works, cheers
Yeah, and getcollectiblecount returns the total number of collectibles
If I understand correctly, `GetCollectibleNum()` takes id of an item and returns the amount of that item that player has. For example, `player:GetCollectibleNum(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SAD_ONION)` should return the amount of Sad Onion items that player has.
Probably
answered my own question, dont worry
Count seems to apply twice when I'm checking for stacked items, i guess Count means total number since I have the D6
What's the difference between GetCollectibleCount and GetCollectibleNum?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842813735
i think im having problems getting my own custom challenges to work
Although don't quote me on that
The reference simply becomes nil I'm guessing
Yeah, you can use a MC_POST_UPDATE callback to hold references to any and all tears and check the exact frame when one has died
Like when entity.Velocity == 0
Is there some hacky way to do it?
That's one of the callbacks that is at the "feature request" stage
Is there some form of death callback, or a way to check each frame for a tear death?
hmm, what's the easiest way to get the exact moment a tear impacts the ground?
To get values in [a,b[, do `math.random() * (b - a) + a`
I'll try that
thanks!
`math.random() / 2 + 0.5`
xD
oh, yeah
Or the other way around, rather
`(math.random() + 0.5) / 2`
I don't think you can have math.random(0.5, 1)
yeah, is there a way to get values between 0.5 and 1 only?
The grimness is probably due to the values you're getting out of math.random()
I didn't do anything x)
Pretty much, thanks alot
And does it work like you wanted ?
doing 
```Lua
entities[i].Color = Color(0, 0, 0, 1, math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255));
```
modifies the whole tear to random colors including outline, doing
```Lua
entities[i].Color = Color(math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), 1, 0, 0, 0);
```
just changes the inside
So it "also" affects the outline
For example, here's Isaac with full (255) red offset:
^
No, they affect the color of the whole sprite.
I'm guessing
In RO, GO, BO, O is for outline
Oooh
it stays black
whereas the RGB values don't
Except it also affects the outline
I fail to see what use it has though
From what I've gathered it's sort of a tint
I'm guessing it's values automatically added to the RGB components
What do the offsets do btw?
nice, cheers
Well there's that
Tears look slightly grimy now, but the colors randomize
The fourth too? I'll try setting alpha to 1 then
But heh another inconsistency I guess
Weird, as Isaac.RenderText expects colors in RGB integer space
oh so I did seem to have it right haha
Ah ?
<@203215784770535424>  Wrong. It expects first four parameters (red, green, blue, opacity) as a number in range [0; 1], and only offsets in range [0, 255].
Either one would work
So what you want to do is tint the sprite, not change the entity's color
Hm
and none of the other values matter
the tears are all white, with red outlines
the problem I have, is that if red is anything other than 0
Yeah
math.random(0, 255) i assume
I tried that too
Not 0 and 1
Also, colors are between 0 and 255
Offsets, I see
'red offset, green offset, blue offset'
What are the last 3 parameters for ?
I'm just saying that the fact you can't do it is weird
This is sorta what i tried

```Lua
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entities[i].FrameCount == 0 then
        entities[i].Color = Color(math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), 255, 0, 0, 0)
      end
    end
```
Yeah I gotcha
Say I want to randomize tear color every shot, so it's sort of a rainbow
But I want some tear colours that aren't currently in there
That's weird, I can't see why you'd have only flat R/G/B since tear effects like Number 1 makes color tears
or a combination of RGB, since i can only seem to get flat blue/green/red
How would I make a tear blue, or green, or yellow etc
Whenever I set a tear's color value, if red is any value othe than 0 the tears just become red outlined and nothing else changes from the other values
Plop
<@112975821186031616> Try setting SpawnerType maybe?
ok bois i'm off
convenience? with this api?
No one would happen to know of a convenient boolean that allows an NPC to be hurt by other NPC projectiles, would they?
Oh well, I guess I'll have to monitor stats manually.
I don't think there is. It might just be broken :/
hmm
The one with maxfiredelay.
i said 2 problems lol
Yes, I have exactly that problem.
or something
cause i heard something about changin maxfiredelay
is it the flag that is not working or does the stats not work?
Is there a way to make `CacheFlag.FLAG_FIREDELAY` work?
It seems like I'm missing part of a conversation.
nothing too interesting
What happened?
(that was a joke cuz he erased himself from existence)
grill's my spriter
uhm btw don't worry too much about some physics i threw in there to make the familiar move
who's grill?
grill pls
xd well played
hueh
-i'm joking-
he's not a modder
what's he doing in the modding chat
sneaky
wrong correction*
oh hey it's my sprite artist
mr crabs
that's  a thing
oh yeah
why don't you just check the code?
Hopefully you can give a tutorial later tbh, because I might make more in the future.
i'm too sleepy to give a tutorial right now
<@227262590697340928> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842710968 this is my mod, I made a familiar
dAMN IT
I wouldn't know, that was a mockup made before AB+ came out
<@70946604139425792> How do you make a familiar?
that doesn't replace another
how to make original character
Is CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY bugged right now?
local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/snappy.anm2")

since the costumes link with the name
how would I add michael's hair and his body anm2
hmm small crisis...
noice
ok
shameless plug > Just released a new mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842710968
also
i know
?
Azazel apparently uses the costume 11 which is ShopDaWoop
fun fact
hmm
;-;
didnt touch that subject yet
familiars???
make
to
how
know
anybody
does
lol
but Id rather throw it on the devs :3
cuz either, I didnt add it or the devs fked up
Why dont they have achievements for custom characters
idk, I didnt read too much about him, but he is an angel
Michael
u mean Michael or smthing else?
Archangle of Protection (If memory serves me right)
Tada
cool
I might release it when I'm done working on it
would you mind letting me take a look at it?
yeah I imagine it would be
it looks useful for testing
ah
yeah that's just something I threw together for a laugh
I mean the program your using to test
it's just something I threw together for a laugh
limit, in your gifs what program is that?
sure
dOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO MAKE FAMILIARS???? ;-;
I don't think so. If I'm not mistaken, the second argument of `Sprite():Load()` tells the game if it should load the sprite immediately. If it's not `true`, it doesn't happen, and you have to manually load it using `Sprite():LoadGraphics()`.
hmm something to do with Sprite():LoadGraphics() ?
How do I load and render a sprite? I'd assume 
```lua
local sprite = Sprite()
sprite:Load('gfx/path/to/image.png', true)
``` but it crashes the game. Also, what are 2 and 3 arguments of `sprite:Render(Vector position, Vector topLeftClamp, Vector bottomRightClamp)`?
*best book
nice book
i'm... sorry lol
how to familiar
apparently there are files for Delirium using the Sins' forms, but they haven't actually been edited
bossportraits.xml tells the game which portrait to use, so that'd be only if you were changing a name of something, I'd suspect
Thanks Awez
<@!117109151334662144>  \The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx\ui\boss ?
Probably that.
bossportraits.xml?
Nope. Just the regular end game cutscenes.
cutescenes.xml is my best guess
Don't know if this is modding related, but where would I find the files for the boss room cutscenes?
Like, I can make some for any mods as i'm an "artist" who's shit at programming
Bored, anyone want sprites?
also is there a good place to start learning Lua?
Limit, what program are you running in that gif?
isn't there a familiars xml unpacked
I have an error with the pacman mod , I start a new game and it start teleport me to  treasure room infinitely and I can´t do nothing
especially how do i make the xml file for familiars
how do i make familiars
What sprite should i edit?
What should I start?
I'm on the vibe

timescale -1, how is it even supposed to work?
spriting is my favorite thing
Which one, I meant
So learn

But I just don't know
Maybe i should learn code
?
You're a mad man <@145740433165647873>
like it's so good
code flows from my fingers tbh
coding is p easy but a boring chore imo
You just do what you want
But spriting
You have to know what you're doing
tbh
it comes naturally
coding is the best for me
It's hard to understand
Coding is hell
Not really, at least for me
i wish the game would just generate good sprites for you lmao
sprites are the worst thing tbh

Does anyone know how to restart the run via Lua? I looked through the docs and couldn't find anything ?
hello
someone asked me what this was, I thought you might have an answer
wha
lol I'm glad it works for that
honestly i think it's good for dramatic effect with the superhot one at least
it seems like some sort of room test

How do you change the tiny icon for an item that's in the pause menu under 'my stuff'?
you could also check if the lab curse is on. and if it is, restart the run via lua
even tho i doubt that is what you want
well. you can forbid specific curses on challenges
same applys to code. you cant do anything before the init of the player, which happens past room gen
the BLCK CNDL easter egg seed does work, but i want to make a mod to do that automatically
because items are assigned to characters after the first floor is already generated
mh. why doesnt Black candle work?
ahh
Curse of the XL
Curse of the Lab? ?
Does anyone know of a way to enable easter eggs? Or alternatively, disable Curse of the Lab on the first floor? (Giving a char Black Candle as a starting item doesn't work =\)
a better method would probably be to generate them on runtime, looping trough all rooms until one has desired shape and door positions, and then spawing everything in that room by code upon entering.
way
interesting
hm
that wont guarantee that theyll apear on every floor, nor will they have special icons or something. hm.
you could make a few rooms, and make them unique, like always having a battery in each corner or sth similar. And when entering a new room you search for that pattern.
custom rooms like challenge rooms/treasure rooms?
Is there any hacky way to add custom rooms, or doors?
Loop through all the entities and check if they are tears from the player, then do stuff with it.
So how would one make an item like tough love
nah
Is there a mod callback for firing tears?
nice

"If I want to have two items, do I tell the games I want two items or one ?"
Duh x)
okay if i want to make another item do i put it in items.xml as well, i suspect i do

Hum
what even is wotl
I DID IT
I FIXED IT
Anyone wanna help me program my mod? I'll pay $20 to someone who can get WotL style death animation room clears working. Can PM me for more info.
all of their original game's xml has different capitalization
I hope it doesn't change
It might change
You never know
Probably, but it's good practice anyway
in the filenames
It's in my DNA now
I had the exact same problem with 4 people ; they had forgotten to use a capital C instead of a lowercase C
the capitals don't matter
Okay I'm fucking blind
... except it's a G xD
Nothing wrong. XD
Capital C?
Always with the capital C hahaha
Also, wrong case, it should be a capital C seeing your XML
I wonder what's wrong there.
Fucking RIP xD
Hm.

oh
Yeah that's what I thought.
Maybe make it a square with some padding but I doubt that's an issue
that is fine
Well the bit depth is 32, but the dimensions are also 32x37 but I don't know if that's an issue.
Extrapolate, should I say
Interpolate that as you wish
Well I'm French so it says the French for "Color Depth" for me haha
You mean bit depth?
It should say 32
Right-click on it, Properties, Details tab, Color Depth
Well, someone's doing my spriting for me, he's in the chat if he'd like to pop in here. Also I don't know if the png's 32-bit.
There's not only that
namely, is the png 32-bit?
How did you create your PNG file ?
Hmm
That's exactly it.
Yeah.
So the item works but has no texture ?
Yessiree
grill.png is in a folder named resources/gfx/items/collectibles/ ?
Yessiree.
items.xml is in a folder named content yeah ?
anyways you get the point
yeah i did
I assume you forgot to copy the starting < haha
i knew i did it wrong i'm pretty sure
god damn it
```LUA
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
```
```items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/">
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>``` That's items.xml
I'm doing just that
Wait a second
Sooo ?
It'll only all be fine when it works haha
Good point.
That you don't know
Everything in my code is fine, including items.xml and main.lua.
Anyway, textures
Anyways.
No :c
I did see that.
You saw nothing
rip typo
Hum
<@227262590697340928>  it's fine now, you can tell us
mook what textures?
Okay, seriously, I really need help to get these textures to work. DM me when you can, thanks.
Yeah exactly what EatMe said
Basically, your MC_USE_ITEM sets a flag to true, and your MC_EVALUATE_CACHE only applies the stat boost if the flag is true
and then when the player leaves the room you'll see in update, where you'll reset the flag
Yeah exactly
you link evaluate_cache and use_item together with a flag
<@242339793588060160> I'm not done explaining haha
seems about right to me
i will try my best
okay....
Is that right ?
Step 3 : have another callback (probably MC_POST_UPDATE, I'm not sure) to stop the effect after the player leaves the room
Step 2 : have a MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback to actually perform the stat change
Step 1 : have a MC_USE_ITEM callback to know when the effect should start
Alright, so you need several passes for this, somebody correct me if I'm wrong at any point
Yeah thats what i want to do.
So if I get you, what you want to do is have an active item that adds 3 damage and -3 speed right ?
Then, you try to use a variable that doesn't exist, `cacheFlag`
okay.
Yeah
so remove the if statement?
So you can ditch that test altogether
First of all, you don't need to check if the player has FatEyes on him, since the function was triggered by the player using FatEyes
Yeah sure
im confused on what i did wrong can you explain it again?
So I guess I should say "you **should** only modify the player's stats ..."
It'll be reset the next frame, since this is an active item's use callback
you just really really shouldn't.
It won't be taken into account is what I mean
not true, you can modify them whenever you want
You use nothing ? it's guaranteed that this condition is met
And you can only modify the player's stats in a MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback
so what do i use instead?
<@242339793588060160> the `player:HasCollectible`check is redundant since `use_FatEyes` is only called when using FatEyes
also try your log.txt and search for "err" or "warn"
wait
yes.
<@242339793588060160> did you add .png to your gfx="" in items.xml?
wait is alphabirth volunteer
Matre it dosen't work so i am guessing its something doing with main.lua here is my script ````local MyMod = RegisterMod("TestersMod",1)
local FatEyes = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Fat Eyes")

function MyMod:use_FatEyes()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(FatEyes) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 3;
    end
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 3;
    end
  end
  end
    
MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod.use_FatEyes, FatEyes)````
No really x)
lol
Well except if your file doesn't have one
Oh yeah right
gfx needs a file extension
Gotcha
yeah for now this is just the simplist
Oh yeah and there's no callback for the latter, I see
So it ever becomes a performance issue I can optimize it
Alright thanks
<@203215784770535424>  really I only need to save each time the D8 is used, and each time a Dice Item is picked up
I doubt that's it but you never know with these things
Maybe remove the spaces around the = signs
Alright, so i tried it and i only has 1 charge...
That's 100% a question that wants an answer
No it's not EatMe xD
<@242339793588060160> that looks about right
it's a rhetorical
Dude you have the same list of callbacks as we do
alright Matre i tried it ```` <active cache="damage speed" name = "Fat Eyes" description="Eyes to the next level!" gfx="Collectibles_fateye" maxcharges="5"/>````
is there a callback for when the player quits?
If I may ask
<@266706294306635776> why saving mod data on every game update though ?
Nice x)
I got all tested out when I played an hour-long run
Yeah I getcha haha
not the sitting and helping for 2 hours
same about the efficiency opinion
Good guys ^_^
same
Much more efficient way to learn than making mods
I've been sitting here helping people for 2 hours hahaha
did anybody try toph by any chance?
Yeah, you got an easier nickname? ?
That's a feat
Wow great work on writing my nick haha
Matrefeytontias is right
nbd.
yeah I missed that.
Sorry, I didn't add much context
He explained what the item was supposed to do before that
the only thing I read was "Is there any way to circumvent the base damage multiplication? I want my item to multiply your damage by 1.5 exactly, and take away that when you get health back"
He said that he wanted the item to multiply by 1.5 as long as he had one red heart container half-full
No
you said you want your item to multiply by 1.5, then decrease by that much
it wasn't that though haha
I figured it out, thanks anyways
...hang on
are you gaining or losing damage in between multiplying by 1.5 and dividing by 1.5?
Hang on too many things at once
_coughs
i kind of, sort of, still need help getting my textures to work_
I miss your point
so I'm saying
so the base multiplication is there to stop that?
... yeah ?
I end up with 4.
then I divide by 1.5
then I get a damage up which makes it 6
and it gets multiplied by 1.5 to 3
if my damage is 2
So if that one changes but `Isaac.SaveModData` doesn't, I'll be ready
I'd still use `mod:SaveModData` though, since it's the lowest-level implementation in the class hierarchy ?
But rather than 1.5x, it seems to do 2 or more
I'm leaving it ?
fuck me
Yeah lol
Is there any way to circumvent the base damage multiplication? I want my item to multiply your damage by 1.5 exactly, and take away that when you get health back
Both seem equivalent
Sorry <@266706294306635776> it seems that I may have goofed
I was about to say, "inb4 `mod:SaveModData`  actually calls `Isaac.SaveModData(mod)`"
Welp alright
Oh so it's the same thing
which calls Isaac.SaveModData
TophMod:SaveData()
And you're using `Isaac.SaveModData` ?
so I'm pretty sure it's a per-mod sorta scenario
I'd try it if I were you haha
in my mod folder
there's a save.dat file
okay thanks I'll change it
uh
afaik yes
Does crackedDiceMod:SaveModData work identically?
Maybe not but welp
We suspect that it uses a general cache that could be overridden by other mods
I see you use `Isaac.SaveModData`
<@203215784770535424>  What are you talking about with crackedDiceMod:SaveModData
and it's compatible with other mods now as well
lol
Oh alright
but I found it
alright I've fixed the save consistency issue
I didn't implement it in my mod
no I mean both
And you meant "not documented", not "not implemented" hah
Doesn't it do that if you do -1 or something?
Wow nice
if you spawn an item pedestal with the ID as CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_NUM or whatever the last one is, it will choose one at random
<@266706294306635776> you should use `crackedDiceMod:SaveModData`, we're not sure what the implications are yet but it's probably better like that
I learned one cool thing that isn't implemented though
I hope you find the source code helpful
<:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
Don't forget to rate it on steam then ?
thanks <@223869207748542464>
Sure
i will see what i can do!
okay thanks
Apart from that, they're the same as passive items
<@266706294306635776> your mod is awesome!
And they use the `MC_USE_ITEM` callback
okay?
<@242339793588060160> active items need an `<active>` tag in items.xml
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
Fuck yeah
I dont understand how to make active items...i can make passive items are they the same or something?
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
Ooooh I just got Polyphemus it seems
?
`spawn 5.100.ID`
What's the console command for spawning a pedestal item?
Oh I see
it's like an active that shapeshifts into different dice
on use
it just shuffles die items
<@223869207748542464> haha I tried to help you ?
it's not a big spoiler
eh
Did I just spoil myself xD
i am an idiot
yes
Is D infinity a thing ?
Thanks ?
<@203215784770535424> ok, dude sorry
Beautiful
I never doubted that haha
Oh, that clear code...
Of course
it's not that great to have to put everything in main.lua
when I say
see that's what I'm talking about
And names are allowed to collide between pickup types, it's fine
Not an item
Cracked Dice is a trinket
My god it's huge
Nice, but cracked dice is already the name of an item
gave myself the wafer, a bomb only took half a heart and triggered the effect, seems to work fine

<@109624258317033472> <@266032468853915650> Mod finished! https://github.com/atomoton/crackedDice/blob/master/main.lua
Try and find out
Theoretically, to do it properly you should set a flag to check it later in POST_UPDATE or something
What if another mod blocks the damage? :P
There's only one problem
Yep
damage was the second parameter if i remember correctly
No problem
cheers
^thats probably a good idea
Like it will do later anyway
That or just subtract `damage` from `entity:ToPlayer():GetHearts()`
every game update
Upon anything being updated?
when is POST_UPDATE called?
And manually get the player entity
so yeah
I figured that now haha
You could just use MC_POST_UPDATE
is called before the entity takes damage
entity take dmg
nobody told you? lol
ah right
Don't think so
is there a modcallback for that
The ordering must be weird, how do I get my health value AFTER taking damage rather than upon taking damage?
almost like its delayed
And in POST_UPDATE ```lua
if flag then
    flag = false
    --RUN ONLY ONCE
end```
Weird, if I bomb myself GetHearts() only goes down by 1 rather than the expected 2 from losing a full heart, but if i then run into a fire it goes down by 2 immediately after rather than 1
ok
idk then
You basically do `flag = true` in POST_PLAYER_INIT
Also, if you want practical example of the function, https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2767/extra-consumables
<@223869207748542464> That would only check for new floor
lol
oh
I see
~~what~~
```lua
function MOD:NewGame()
local level = game:GetLevel()
   if game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() then 
--code
end

MOD:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , MOD.NewGame)
``` should work
alright awesome
You need to set a flag in POST_PLAYER_INIT and check the flag in POST_UPDATE
And it doesn't work in POST_PLAYER_INIT because some shit doesn't get set/reset
is this for new game or new floor
yes
Why not ?
kube it's your code, right?
ok let me modify this
I said it doesn't work in POST_PLAYER_INIT
because you can't detect the save slot
What are you even doing
<@116386733905412105> it is currently impossible to have separate state per save slot
<@116386733905412105> dude
```lua
function MOD:NewGame()
local level = game:GetLevel()
   if game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and    level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1 then 
--code
end

MOD:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , MOD.newRun)
```
just not the same saved run
like, it can be the same save file
hi
<@126590786945941504> wrote that
Huh
not loading the program and continuing a saved game
and it needs to be a NEW new game
1 sec
oh
<@223869207748542464> that only checks for the player starting a new floor, not a new game
awesome thanks
~~not your code, and you still managed to fuck up the indentation~~
<@116386733905412105> yes, 
```lua
function MOD:NewGame()
local level = game:GetLevel()
   if game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and    level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1 then 
--code
end
```Not my code <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
Notably checking if the previous floor is the same as the current floor
<@116386733905412105> there are a number of ways
that would then be used to apply all of the stat mods whenever needed
<@203215784770535424>  i might do that yea
you should just be able to add cache mods to some sort of list
instead of manually handling cache evals
cache can be implemented better
Yeah probably
but that can be implemented better
I mean I guess it's for damage multipliers
<@235104838550159361> nope, I've been searching for that for a while but found nothing, you might want to write that in the Lua Megathread on Reddit
thanks ? I'll make sure I only have the fields I actually need in there then and no id (pretty sure I didn't but I'll double check before uploading)
<@268036083827212290> yeah I'm not sure it's relevant, except maybe to ensure every bonus is only applied once. Which is defeated by the fact that the cache refresh can happen more than once anyway, smh
but this one just seems neglectable
I mean, I'm all for optimization
Is the code complication worth the tiny possible performance increase?
is there a way to check if a new game was started?
Btw guys , any of you found how to modify devil deal chance?  i found how to modify angel room chances (even if i cant modify it less than +100%) but cant seem to find the right function/attribute to modify devil room chances
Why do they even use the cache system, to be honest
I added an explanation for the `cache` field that I just noticed
because achievements are completely disabled
ugh that reminds me of how you can't even add custom achievements
Your trinket will be added to the trinket pool as long as you have a line for it in your `content/items.xml` file
So there you go.
If you do give an `id` field, there's a risk it will collide with another trinket from another mod that just happens to have chosen the same ID
Also, since you're doing a custom trinket, it can't have an `id` field because it'll be assigned one
Only fill in the relevant fields, ie if you don't need to unlock your trinket, don't give it an `achievement` field
```XML
<trinket description="" achievement="" gfx="" id="" name="" cache="" />
```
Description, id and name are self-explanatory ; achievement is the ID of the achievement that unlocks this trinket, and gfx is the path to your trinket's graphics. `cache` is a set of words that say which stats your trinket will tinker with, like "damage speed" or "all"
According to the `items.xml` file in the game's resources, a trinket is defined like so
It will also get an ID assignated, and since it's not consistent (it depends on what mods were loaded before yours), you'll access to it using its name
You don't need to do anything code-wise
It'll be added as long as it's specified in your XML files
I miss string interpolation in lua
<@203215784770535424> cool that makes sense. So will my trinket automatically be in the trinket "pool" or is there any code I need to write to add mine to it?
Just run it with the game and use `log("stuff")` in your code
Or, if you're lazy, here's my debug mod
now I need it to trigger at the right times
<@219159380094877696> `Isaac.RenderText`
<@219159380094877696> look into `Isaac.RenderText(string, x, y, r, g, b, a)`
alright I have my data saving and loading
All trinkets are in the same "pool", you could say
Just so debugging is easier, what's the best way to print to a log/the screen so I can debug easier?
Item Pools, as the name implies, is only for actual collectible items
You're mistaken
Does anyone know how itempools work for trinkets? Is there a seperate itempool for them that I should add mine to, or something else? ?
I'm doing so many learns
Man I feel like I'm learning more fixing other people's shit than making mods haha
No problem dude
<@219159380094877696> make sure the character's damage multiplier doesn't come in play
That's probably due to where I'm outputting it... 
Cheers for the help
For example, don't go running EvaluateItems every tick if you have to change the stats every tick
thanks alot guys
You can edit stats anywhere, but you also have to reapply them in EVALUATE_CACHE
Only weird part is it seems to output 5.00 when I have 2 full hearts, but it works
but it's not recommended
it's possible
Actually
true
you mean that
oh
You can only modify player stats in a `MC_EVALUATE_CACHE` callback
not make the player take damage
I think he  wants to modify player damage
<@219159380094877696> if that's the damage stat we're talking about, you can't do that in a `MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG` callback
Inheritance my man
^
Everything that's in Entity, you can use from EntityPlayer
BTW, do note
Oh, that was in entity not EntityPlayer
Also might have redundant code, I haven't bothered testing ```lua
local function isNewGame()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    return game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1
end```
to get the current save slot
I'm gonna try to find some sort of hacky way
I don't need ToPlayer() for the Damage value though?
I have had the code for a while, though mind you, it doesn't work in POST_PLAYER_INIT
Yeah I changed it haha
haha
is it meant to be entity:ToPlayer?
semicolon?
hey Kube someone said you were working on a code to check for a new run?
I edited it
Oooh no wait
to read the log
you could also use `--luadebug` and `io.open`
I just tried exactly that, it still returns nil value for method GetHearts?
Tell me if you want the piece of crap ¯\_(?)_/¯
I define it as a global, so as long as the mod I'm testing in either loads after LogMod or I use `luamod` I can access it just fine
<@219159380094877696> here, try this
```Lua
local madPack = RegisterMod("MadPack",1.0);

-- Here you only monitor the player anyway, see the AddCallback line, so no need to even retrieve another player since it can be one of many players in coop
function madPack:broken_hearted_trigger(entity, damage, flags, source, damageCountdown)
  entity.Damage = entity:ToPlayer():GetHearts();
end

madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, madPack.broken_hearted_trigger, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER);
```
Just a custom function for logging
or a custom function for logging?
with `luadebug`?
Because using the log was annoying
I use a custom minimod that has a 10-most-recent-messages log displayed right on the screen
its immediate, so it works for me
yes. XD
I have an odd way of testing
Are you looking at Found HUD to debug number values?
huh
Right now I'm just testing to try find the health value
And you're overwriting the damage, which means you can even make it lower than it was
You're not using EVALUATE_CACHE
and you can remove the player definition
Has anyone here created a mod that changes what your tears look like to a new sprite/anm2 i.e. head of the keeper?
Or rather two problems stemming from one
you really only need to define it as`function madPack:broken_hearted_trigger(player)`
My personal advice would be to always start variable names with a lowercase letter to avoid this shit
And there's one problem...
That way you can ensure you're using the right player
That's the point of what I said before
yup
I could also use 'Entity' from the parameters instead of player too, right?
As I said, it collides
It's a placeholder at the moment really
If you look at docs for `EntityPlayer`, you use them like `ply = SomethingThatReturnsAnEntityPlayerLikeIsaac.GetPlayer(0)` and `ply:SomeMethodFromEntityPlayer()`
It collides with global class definitions
If I were you I wouldn't call your parameters that
I'll get the hang of this and try not bother you all haha
Hum
Could've sworn I tried that, dang
^
you want `player:GetHearts()`
`player` is an instance of `EntityPlayer`
Yeah
EntityPlayer is a class
is `EntityPlayer:GetHearts()`
Also `EntityPlayer`
anyway your problem
When the player get damage, you're ignoring the entity you got passed and getting the 0-player instead
lol
Damn you syntax highlight haha
One thing to note
```
local madPack = RegisterMod("MadPack",1.0);

function madPack:broken_hearted_trigger(Entity, Damage, Flags, Source, DamageCountdown)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  player.Damage = EntityPlayer:GetHearts();
end

madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, madPack.broken_hearted_trigger, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER);```
But yeah, this:
I wrote it like I do it haha
I actually always wanted to check if it's case insensitive or if they have a few cases of... cases
Eh, it's how I code in other languages mostly, so it's just a habit thing
Heh it's whatever
saves some keystrokes
it's case insensitive
you don't need to capitalize XML or Lua like that
I see
Little pushpin icon in the top-right
See the pinned post
haha
Would if I knew how
<@219159380094877696> use formatting pls
formatting
dude
I've broken it down to its simplest and it still doesn't seem to work

local madPack = RegisterMod("MadPack",1.0);

function madPack:broken_hearted_trigger(Entity, Damage, Flags, Source, DamageCountdown)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  player.Damage = EntityPlayer:GetHearts();
end

madPack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, madPack.broken_hearted_trigger, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER);
oh yes
<@223869207748542464>
like that player.Damage / 8 + 0.5
Probably bad programming or left over code
Turn that :
```Lua
local PoopshootScaleTear = 0.5 + (player.Damage / 4) * 0.5
if 0.5 + (player.Damage / 4) * 0.5 >= 5 then 
    PoopshootScaleTear = (0.5 + (player.Damage / 4) * 0.5) / 4
end
```
into that :
```Lua
local PoopshootScaleTear = player.Damage / 8 + 0.5
if PoopshotScaleTear >= 5 then 
    PoopshootScaleTear = PoopshootScaleTear  / 4
end
```
My only guess would be
Whereas EntityPtr doesn't have the data, but references the Entity's address directly
Maybe EntityRef doesn't get affected when the entity gets removed, but Entity does?
My only guess would be
Yeah, haha
<@268036083827212290> Yeah, that one's just weird
Yeah I was about to say haha
;D
There are some oddities, like `(player.Damage / 4) * 0.5`
what about how both EntityRef and EntityPtr exist?
ok
But overall it's fine
ok
As I said earlier, you could still move the variables to the left in arithmetic expressions
<@223869207748542464> yeah it's better, didn't try and find errors but the formatting is better
???
I'm criticizing bad design

<@203215784770535424> is it enough clear?

    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
      for i = 1, #entities do
        local e = entities[i];
          if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and e.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER and e.Variant ~= 783 then

sugmod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, sugmod.Poopshoot_effect);
```
it's bound
why are you acting like I'm insulting you because I'm criticizing nicalis' code
Since it's here
It is implemented in Lua though
Yes, instead let users pass arbitrary pointers to arbitrary locations in memory
it's internal
it's not implemented in Lua
SO that's an actual pointer to Entity
<@269950308606672898> make sure your player entity is retrieved when it actually exists, ie inside a callback and not at top-level of the mod
it *is* bad design
Because Lua doesn't have pointers
why are you blindly defending them
"using an actual pointer to Entity"
kube
*Oh no I have to do one more line of code*
why is EntityPtr a class instead of just using an actual pointer to Entity
"terrible"
it's still terrible design
Not everything inside the engine uses Entity, it might just be that some stuff uses Entity*
I'm getting a nil value error for GetHearts?
They probably didn't mean to expose it
that's my point
yeah but
Probably internals
C++ binding thing
why does EntityPtr even exist
It needs many more subclasses
Several entities can shoot but not all, several entities can die but not all, the list goes on
The class hierarchy for Entity should much more disparate
... yeah
b a d l y d e s i g n e d c o d e
Yeah, HitPoints are defined in Entity indeed
Oh I get the confusion now hahaha
My bad
Oh oops sorry I misread
right
that was FlipskiZ
<@203215784770535424> I never said "PlayerEntity"
attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetHearts')?
So it's EntityPlayer that you mean
^
PlayerEntity doesn't exist though haha
EntityPlayer extends Entity
Entity is where HitPoints comes from
no
And also Woob you mean EntityPlayer
I could try and see when that evolves
I made a general-purpose mod for displaying properties
HitPoints is inherited from Entity, maybe it's not used at all for players
Maybe a multiplier of some sort, I don't know
`player.HitPoints` is how much damage the player takes in the floor I think
There you go haha
under PlayerEntity
http://i.imgur.com/im8ydNf.png
I think I've come accross this in the doc, let me see
from the moon, obviously
I've tried to find a way to find a health value, but player.HitPoints seems to return 1.00 always, and never anything else, even after taking damage and dying
Where did LUA even come from?
Oh, my bad, sorry ?
I'm trying to make an item that doubles your damage when you have half a red heart in any place (so health is 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 etc)
haha
```
"Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". Please do not write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua" right!
```
Same except for the Lua part haha
I have alot of experience in LUA and all sorts of other languages, and work as a game developer, so it's binding of isaac-based
Welcome to the club, I arrived yesterday
hello James Mattis
Helloes
Hey guys, I'm new to the whole modding thing and need a tiny bit of help
I'll try, thanks
and then :ToFamiliar() it
I think you should be able to add a variant of entity type 3
Oh wait, I think I know what to try
Except that works since Saxarok is using it
What's the proper way to add familiars?
Because it says here that "many objects are inaccessible via current API, such as the return value of `FireTear()`"
How up-to-date is this list ?
Makes sense
yeah. they dont want pople to make a virus so they are disabled fornow
niice
So it's being taken care of
"require broken - can't import libraries (intentional?) - yes, intentional, they are working on a sandboxing fix"
Oh hey
I'll post in there
And the thing we're talking about is not in there, alright
I see that yeah
that post has a "Missing API" section
I was about to go like "feature request : make (Load/Save)ModData use tables instead of strings to actually be useful"
this too https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mzkqp/afterbirth_lua_api_bug_megathread/
I guess
I believe it's both
I've seen that, that's a feature request, not a question
eey, my post
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/820061495388028928
<@203215784770535424> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5nugvk/tyrone_is_going_to_answer_modding_questions/
You should too, I doubt they read every single tweet
Alright I'll do just that
can't argue with robo baby
Robo-Baby agrees haha
Duno how feature requests work
tweet at him maybe
We should tell that to Tyrone or some shit
the lack of game state mod saves is dumb too
And then you put whatever in it
instead of serializing by itself
Yeah it is, it might as well be a table
yes
The save/load you mean ?
that it forces *you* to give it a string
but yeah it's dumb
Only remove build steps
Yeah right
I won't have to change any code
If not, I'll look into it then
it's just nice because when they do fix that
yeah probably
I'll think that'll be fixed before I write a mod that needs several files
No big deal
Yeah I see that
:/
but it's linux/mac only
and then at the end you just `luamerger src/ -o main.lua`
so you can actually do stuff like `json = require("json")`
Aaaaargh
That's so full of shiiiiiit
Wait no because that needs `require`
it reimplements `require`
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n7xto/linuxmac_only_luamerger_a_simple_lua_script/
Like a `#include` but for Lua
You can use different Lua files
to merge it into the script as the last step before running the mod
now you have to either embed the whole module in main.lua or use something like luamerger
you were able to `require("json")` because Isaac ships with json.lua
when `require` was available without luadebug
So the string can be of some use
Yup
At least give us a JSON or XML parser to go with that
That's the stupidest thing
You can save one single string of data per mod ?
Also what's bullshit again
I have to rescan the documentation
Try that and tell us how it goes
which reminds me
Good call haha
I just didn't even look
that adds completions
I have the sublime text extension
I've used it a lot for bug testing mid game
Knowing this is the only use I got out of ZeroBrane Studio hahaha
but just went with Isaac.SaveModData
yeah I just tried `mod:SaveModData`, got an error, didn't even check in `resources/scripts/main.lua` in the game
I think that's rather what you want
Oooooh, I was trying `mod:SaveModData`
Like, the thing that's returned by `RegisterMod`
By itself
Also, your mod has a SaveData and LoadData method
which forces you to implement buggy behavior when you switch between save slots during runs
You can't save per-slot
I mentioned that before
it's one string, yeah
Yup
You sure of that ?
Whhaaaat it's a single slot ?
`Isaac.LoadModData(yourmod)` to load the string
here is one: `Isaac.SaveModData(yourmod, "abc")` to save the string `abc`
is there a "saving and loading data" tutorial?
Hahaha, you brought this upon yourself
my ass is 1000° now, but thx
Alright well there you go
nothing.
You said ?
thx
yeah
oh
`tear` is undefined
i said
dude
`PoopshootTear.TearFlags = tear.TearFlags | TearFlags.TEAR_PIERCING`
<@223869207748542464> Oh wait I know why the poisoning doesn't work
No problem
anyway thx...
Also about the poisoning, I still have to look into that
Anyway yeah you know what to do now
Yeah that's much better indentation
Anywaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
is this better for you?
<@268036083827212290> scroll up!
"what" for the seventh time
to read who I responded to
I think you need to scroll up
what
So no need to bring it up
look, that is better?
Like respecting people helping you or not sending all caps
<@268036083827212290> you won't get a reward for doing things you're supposed to do
and don't send all caps lock messages
I'm not familiar enough with the language
<@150336707609231362> At least I actually respect people who try to help me
I'm not sure how you can do that in Lua, probably something with metatables
Basically PoopshootHitMax needs to be a member variable of your poop tear entity
yes
Yeah right ?
What you need to do is have one of that variable for each poop shot
woob likes to brage about how unhelpful he is
Anyway, your code is not working because PoopshootHitMax is shared between all tears
Some people are just stubborn
Yeah that's why I wouldn't even bother helping lol
Careful, you mispressed your caps lock key
DUDE I WOULD FIRST MAKE WORKING CODE, THAN CLEAR NOT WORKING code!
Except clean code is not optimized code
I bet people told you "make your code work first, optimize it later"
See that's why you have ugly code
But you'll do it later I assume
i know i can do ``if ... and e:IsVulnerableEnemy()``
You serious with this
```Lua
if ... and e:IsVulnerableEnemy() == true
```
Oh god
Well he's fortunate he asked me
At that point I'd honestly just give up helping him
If you're gonna say "I don't care" or "I'll do it later" every time I tell you something you can keep your ugly code
That way you can easily see what variables are used in a calculation
Dude you asked, I answer
i don't care
So variables are leftmost in calculations, and numerical values are rightmost
Like, instead of `0.5 + (player.Damage / 4) * 0.5`, do `player.Damage / 8 + 0.5`
kk figured
Go to sleep, wake up tomorrow, wonder what the fuck is going on in the code
<@116386733905412105> I think you just ahve to keep saving
It's not too hard for you today
Also personally I would recommend putting numerical values last in a calculation
is there a callback for when the player exits? I want to save custom data.
but i know that this code looks ULTRA VERY messy
that's not too hard to read for me
dude, thats propper indenting
It's also to not overcomplicate your own life when debugging
yes it is
Having a clear code is not only for others to not die when reading it
That's not how you're supposed to do it xD
just for now i need to make things working
later
i would fix everything
Well you don't do it so haha
That's for proper indentation
that
i know
ok
Remove one before every end
my code is ultra messy
At the start of every block (if, for, while, etc), add a tab
Yeah actually
any tips on how to make your code look good?
I see
no
sugmod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, sugmod.Poopshoot_effect);
Dont you have to cache TearFlag in the XML?
By the way what callback is this ?
ok
I'm looking at it
anyone?
so...
Alright I guess
poop tear
just my custom tear variant
not piercing
Also what's 783 for a variant ?
Is the polyphemus effect working ? I can't tell
That seems a little bit OP for a trinket haha
not that
no
Oh so it's not poisoning ?
and all that is trinket
and posion
Like poop tears with polyphemus effect
So what is it supposed to do that it's not doing ?
the golden poop and red poop anim is just for testing
will fix
not working anim
On second thought that code is too big for Discord
https://streamable.com/e0r4n
Typo
*indentation
i will send a gif
Also you need to get your identation going
Oh
What is it supposed to do, and what does it do ?

Do you want `PoopshootTear.TearFlags`?
`tear.TearFlags`
Tear Flag is not working
why this is not working?!?!?
```lua
function sugmod:Poopshoot_effect()
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
local PoopshootHitMax = 3
if player:HasTrinket(Poopshoot) then  
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities();
    for i = 1, #entities do
      local e = entities[i];
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and e.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER and e.Variant ~= 783 then
        PoopshootHitMax = 3

        player:AddBlackHearts(1)
        if PoopshootHitMax == 2 then

   end   
end
end
```
I think
entityPlayer:GetName() returns "Toph" correct?
guys
That would be the smart thing to do
probably
I hope it eventually does take item names instead of IDs
I could do that
the only way you coudl garentee it is gettign the player on initilization, gettign the name, then giving the item
I wouldn't be surprised if future iterations take an item name
Right
depending on th mods installed first
depending on the number of mods
I mean it makes sense that it would take an ID, but also not because it's not consistent accross games
Why would it take an ID
That's stupid
thats what I ment
that in fact will break
ah, yes
but dosent the player.xml take an ID?
will appear incorrectly
only the little icon in the pause screen
Only the item's icon
Nope
I think
no
problam with that is: If someone installs another mod the item ID changes and break it
Pretty cool
So that's a new character with a new item ?
damn
and you'll have to figure out what earthbending does.
very balanced, from my play-throughs
also if shes not OP I'm dissapointed
what does earthbending do?
or right click -> copy url, yeah
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842397566
right click the page also works
click view mod in the mod uploader
how do I get the link to my mod's workshop page
alright
I assume you're using the original's resources ?
how many things on that screenshot are just placeholders?
But yeah it's impressive
nice
Because it already exists ?
<:plum:259939492008296448>
why not
Why though hahaha
Whoooaaat
that limt threw together for a laugh
They wont tell you. They usually dont
No joke though, what is it ?
through steam?
can I edit the mod's logo
I feel enlightened
Wow thanks guys
it's just something I threw together for a laugh
for a laugh
it's something he threw together for a laugh
it's something melon threw together
It's not Lua, that's for sure
<@145740433165647873> what is this ? Where is it from ?
<@166265383291060224> isaac-ng.exe
something he threw together for a laugh of course
pretty cool
what is the test enviroment that people are useing to test issac mods?
oh good point! okay I fixed it
yeah. looks like its lag
it's something he threw together for a laugh
in super hot time doesn't completely freeze when you stop moving
set it to something like 0.1
don't set timescale to 0
tip
also
is that the antibirth api?
that's really cool
Huh, neat Melon
https://gfycat.com/LeftShallowEgret
eot
because I don't have time to explain basic terminology
and instead I am going to link to google
Im just more proficient with blueprinting
That's why I'm not gonna help them
Its basically like pushing someone out of the way
that's why you help them
it's expected that some people aren't going to know how to code
I think its just best we leave this alone
lol
everyone, cool it
yes
It says that you have no time for his qestions
Don't forget the ending slashes for single-tag fields, don't forget delimiters etc
<@166265383291060224> how is linking to google making fun of him
<@203215784770535424> sure i'll check ?
So make sure your XML is written correctly
Okay i agree that was out of line but still
why make fun of him for not knowing something, just answer his question...
<@229593818691928067> so far, all runtime failures I've seen were caused by XML issues
yo shut the fuck up
Stay classy <@268036083827212290> lmao
ok 12 year old
what it means
Fucking cunt
you wouldn't have asked
because otherwise
no you don't know what it means
I know what fucking legacy means, im just getting confused because of all the bullshit
Then google the term when you don't understand it
Some people here are total programming newbies
so the new room i made with a new boss crashes the game right on the Versus screen, any idea why??
<@268036083827212290> never assume
elitism because I expect people to actually know basic terminology? wew
I just explained stuff don't look at me like that haha
apparently
No i know the terminology, i just get confused
... so much elitism in this channel sometimes
I expect people here to at least know some technical terminology, but I guess I shouldn't
like, WOTL isaac
what
I know legacy means old stuff but I just thought people meant it as in Vanilla isaac
```
The fact that Isaac.GetPlayer takes an integer as a parameter makes me think greatness could happen
``` ```
eh it's probably legacy stuff ``` ```whats legacy
```
what
not if you dont know it
the context is pretty obvious here
what
a lot of things change dependign on context
tl;dr shit that stays from previous versions
why would it have a different meaning
You could just, like, y'know... answer their question. lol.
Of this game he means
what
i know the meaning of the word but i mean in terms of this discord
https://google.com
whats legacy
overlap everything
character wheel would probably break
eh it's probably legacy stuff
Would take a while to scroll through all of them
haha, inb4 100 characters in one game
The fact that `Isaac.GetPlayer` takes an integer as a parameter makes me think greatness could happen
Custom player on the steam workshop. Shows you how to do it(kinda)
did they update it?
eh?
It looked all new to me
Seems fine to me
have you seen the Custom player thing?
really? what did we not know?
I mean, a lot of ab+ was bugged
they whrent we just didnt know how to do it
How come custom characters were bugged
Tyrone posted a GIF of a custom character way before release
Hopfully soon we can add GUI items
wait I'm wondering
~~if only Nicalis actually tested the API~~
If only yeah
if only we could mod the GUI... `Sprite::SetFrame`
I assume you test if the first item your mod adds is equal to ID 511?
nice
obviously I'll explain this but it's the best they get.
I added support for the item's icon if it's the first-loaded or only mod. the alternative is just let it keep using the bouncing eye's icon
and the users of your mod are not likely to be installing your mod first
right.
yes, and you can't modify mod order
wow why is that NOT pasting as a quote?
the problem is that it will conflict with other mods
in case you did not read my message properly
just a note, the item icons will not work properly
kk
Use the ModUploader in the tools
how do I do it
alright I think I'm ready to upload
That's not gonna work well with multiple mods lol
indeed.
wew
oh
<@116386733905412105> so it takes the frame of the ID of the item?
since the frame is just taken from the item's id
Yeah you can't do no merging
the problem is that it will conflict with other mods
note that it's different from the "Death Screen.anm2" that goes in your content folder and is for custom characters
That should be put somewhere if it's not already
Nice
and voila.
and then you add a frame to the Items layer of the anm2
then you add your icon to the png
you also need to grab "death items.png" and put it in the same spot
and put it in your own mod_path/resources/gfx/ui
you need to get "death screen.anm2" from the unpacked resources
sure
You can't even have your enemy hurt by other enemies without reimplementing all damage sources or using something like a punching bag and testing for it taking damage
Oh ? Enlighten us please
I figured out the icon thing
yep
No complex shapes, so simple enough
In Isaac, most hitboxes are spheres
Now, the games hit boxes don't seem to be too complicated though
Define "properly" haha
Collision detection does suck, if you try to do it properly
I mean it's really not hard but that's something you could expect from a high-level API
Now that fucking sucks
either with AABB or by testing radius and distance
you have to do it yourself
I haven't looked into that yet
There's no collision detection ?
and of course GUI/HUD
I just realized that out of the five mods I've coded, all of them start with a B or a C
actual collision detection, per-slot save files, gamestates, affecting floor generation, etc
all I want is just more built in stuff
Like with the evaluate_cache thing
And when you can't do it easily, there's usually a work-around
And you can still do many things as-is
More updates are to be expected anyway
Hopefully they go full force at it once ab+ is fixed
Gotta give them that
Yeah haha
yeah
They do seem dedicated to making it somewhat good
I assumed it was for testing originally but ¯\_(?)_/¯
But I'm still wondering what was the purpose of asking people experienced with lua to contact Tyrone when the API is so unfinished
Yep
I know how hard making an API in a game that has not had one since the beginning is
Just like a certain HUD
Missing yet much needed
with the curses, item pools and characters
they've been doing a good job recently
That's fair
Haha
are implemented
until most of the missing features
I think I'm gonna take a break from the API
i see
i did it so i can instantly teleport to it using the stars card
nono, you 'replace' all rooms with that file, you do not merge, like xmls
otherwise you'd be packaging the game's default rooms with your mod
oh ok
well actually, i removed every treasure room but my own but yeah
it's called when EntityPlayer::AddCacheFlags is called
To be sure it only applies once per frame
nono, its every special room, plus one
It's probably best to hold a flag that gets reset by a `MC_POST_RENDER` callback
it's not called once per frame
ok but in your Pacman mod you only have Specials .stb, does it include ONLY your room ?
Under certain conditions
So it can be called more than once per frame
<@268036083827212290> "Called one or more times when a player's stats must be re-evaluated"
or something like that
using that to just test for pickup, with the intention of just doing a simple dmg up
but I've seen too many mods
under resources/rooms
yeah basicly
Of course it is
You are supposed to add every time it's evaluated
so i just open the Rebirth room binaries, add my room and export to my mod dir, right ?
<@268036083827212290> that's intentional
and just HasCollectible in it is definitely not enough
I am sure that it's not as simple as one would expect though
no, i just want to add a boss room
I'm not completely sure how evaluate cache works
not possible i fear
<@229593818691928067>  from code?
I do believe it's called once per frame
custom rooms i mean
or others ^^ how do loading rooms work ? i'm confused...
Are you sure of the EvaluateCache thing ?
hello <@109624258317033472> ?
probably
testers
What even was the point of Tyrone asking people with Lua experience to contact him long before release
what they don't realize is that EvaluateCache isn't called one time just for the item, so it's going to execute your code whenever you pick up an item that evaluates the same caches that your item does
like evaluate cache, a lot of people do HasCollectible there to test for when the item is picked up and then they modify the stats
there is a lot of stuff like this too
mods will be just full of weird bugs that can't be fixed
Without stuff like state saves and per-slot permament saves
Again, use Pyrokinesis for reference
<@227262590697340928> could you try uploading the whole mod somewhere
Because it's the skin of a collectible
Seeing your `gfxroot`, your item's skin must be in the directories `gfx/Items/Collectibles/`
so we're still at square one
not per slot per mod
that it's one save file per mod
Good to know
the problem is
you can store things permamently with that
Oh, that's a thing?
why aren't the textures showing up does anyone know
Isaac.LoadModData
Isaac.SaveModData
You don't store anything permanently
so um
completely quit
oh you mean
no it doesn't lol
So it doesn't matter, really
The mod gets reloaded when you exit the game
Well
and continue the run
then go back to the first save file
I would guess would be the easiest way of handling items
finish that run
continue a run
what if you go to another save file
You just reset the values when you lose the item
nope
Sure
let me check
pretty sure it isn't
it won't be reset
Doesn't the mod get reloaded on a new run ?
if you go to a different save file and continue a run
on a new run
and you even have code to reset it
if you have a variable that stores something from an item
why this
for example
no I mean
no rumtime errors but
Programmatically you mean <@268036083827212290>  ?
ok so
Gets the job done
how do you guys handle different save files?
I'm using Notepad++ heh
by the way
yes <:isaac:257394072933761026>
notepad?!
You kinda sorta forgot all the delimiters in the world
what editor are you using
like that
how did you even break it
Now it should be `<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/">`
that's obvious
now
Alright
WHABAM
```XML
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>
```
yeah
i'm so fucking stupid
as the triple backticks
you put the `xml` on the same line
Like this :
\`\`\`XML
your text here
\`\`\`
end me
?
WHAT??
????
```xml <items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>```
great fun
which is fun
because like 99% of the time the game crashes with mods is due to xml parsing failures
Not so hard
and run your files through it when the game crashes
```XML
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>
```
get an xml verifier
tip
Yeah hahaha
how do you not see this
`gfxroot="gfx/items/`
????????
also
Dammit Mooknkoyo you had one job
lol
```<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>```
He knows
\`\`\`
your text here
\`\`\`xml
<with the XML syntax highlight this time pls>
Paste your XML once again ?
end me
But yeah, renaming everything to lowercase instead of just being case-insensitive is stupid dumb
why
now i'm getting a runtime error whenever i run the damn game
Tags too I'm guessing
So yes, XML values need to be lowercase it seems
to `items`
it gets renamed
But the folder is named `Items` with a capital I
they just rename files
It's funny how people assosiate stuff
Sample mod has `gfxroot="gfx/items/"` in it
I like how instead of making everything case insensitive
I do love the fact that all cases makes someone look angry.
With the bonus `/`
Calm down
Yeah, it looks fine, but try putting it as `gfx/items/`
The game ignored that an image had an uppercase letter
ok
AHHHHHHHHHH
i fIXED THE RUNTIME ERROR WHEN I SELECT tHE MODS AND NOW IT'S JUST
Nah, I believe you're correct
unless it only does that on linux, which would be retarded
to lowercase
the game renames files
No it's correct
try `gfxroot="gfx/items"`
the game renames stuff to lowercase
I'm 99% sure
gfxroot is bad
```tems version="1" gfxroot="gfx/Items">
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />
</items>``` that's items.xml
but yeah
I was gonna ask that after I got the filename
grill.png
And what's your items.xml?
how is the file called
tbh
i'm still new to this
C:\Users\brett\Documents\my games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\Phantombirth\resources\gfx\Items\Collectibles
"Collectibles" lol
I mean the full filepath from your mod folder
oh
Directory
Exact
Collectibles
Answer the question I asked, <@227262590697340928>, where did you put the item sprite?
so the only problem is making a generic callback for that
so can i get some help making the texture appear on the pedestal and the extra hud?
you can use the method to get the number of collectibles with a certain id
if you know the id
I mean, it is
actually
That's what I call a sucky way haha
the point is
Like, have a flag
<@227262590697340928> Where did you put the item sprite?
Just add the bombs when you see that the player got the item
I mean we would but in a sucky way
<@203215784770535424> Sure you could
evaluate cache is the closest thing
So we wouldn't be able to redo things like "10 bombs"
nope
'cause there's no callback that gets called when you pick up an item right ?
instead of writing code that I will be then forced to rewrite
I might as well wait
not really
better than nothing, imo
But that's the best you can do right now
Yeah
you wouldn't even get an effect if you rolled into it
I fear the quality of your mods if that's reliable enough for you
like if i give myself the item i'll get the +1 damage, but if i ```spawn 5.100.511``` i can pick it up and get the +1 damage but the texture won't be seen, on the pedestal or the extra hud.
<@203215784770535424> ?
"enough"
To be called a "shape" you need properties haha
Reliable enough
if you `giveitem` it won't have any effect
that's not the definition of reliable
<@124088844181045249> that doesn't exist
see when one dissapears
You can track of the item on the ground
to reliably detect item pickup
Nice, there seems to be just no way
because i actually can't seem to do that
I want to be a geometric shape with no defined mathematical properties
how do you get the texture to work
i would like 46° or 69°
Try hanging around more.
You need to have at least **3** items if you expect me to make wings for you.
i want to be a triangel
Hahaha
oh <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
i want to be an angle
Try hanging around more.
How do you feel about 47° ?
You need to have at least **3** items before your soul is even worth it.
i want to be a demon
http://i.imgur.com/vrQMy34.gif Isaac's walking on sunshine.
yes
You want to be an angle ?
BUT I WANT TO BE AN ANGLE!
3 items and u can select angel or demon role
`
const PlayerPocketItem& EntityPlayer::GetPocketItem(integer SlotId) 
`
What's that ? Haha
has a return value that is not bound to lua yet
I like how the only thing that may actually be able to give me a way to get all passive items
Jacob's Ladder is poppin'
At least I have a good item
oh you have my latter
You have found **1** item(s).
Duh haha
!items
You have found **3** item(s).
!items
That too
make the game playable
Absolutely nothing
What do items do anyway
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
aw
!commands
one more item, and i will became an angle!
!help
!items
What's the use of this
i wonder
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
wow
Beware my breath :E
I know a workaround but you have to know the ID of the item you want to check int he first place
wow i misspelled but
Oh so I found Dead Onion
any idea how I would achieve that though
```iwasjokingtbhutsure```
Rolled to: ants
Please D6 that conversation subject
by selling it even though you can get it free
I think he was joking
but I'm sayign on the fact that someone capatlised on an item
**honk** wrong subject
how old are you
communism is better than capatlism
*Coumnism
Capatlism indeed
<:plum:259939492008296448>
MC_COMMUNISM_ACHIEVED?
so, no matter if bought, picked up from pedestal, `giveitem`'d etc
<:plum:259939492008296448>
MC_CAPATLISM_ACHIVED
I'd want it to trigger whenever the player's list of consumables is updated with an entry
But it would make more sense yeah
But when picking anything up
That would not only trigger when buying shit
or MC_PICKUP_ACQUIRED
MC_PICKUP_RECEIVED would be a better name probably
oh wow. Thanks mate! had some dumb mistake, works now ? <@124088844181045249>
<@268036083827212290>, right, smart
<@268036083827212290> so basically you want a MC_PICKUP_BOUGHT callback
you could, as a workaround, just give them mod items on every new run with that particular challenge on
I don't think so
Also, can you add items to a challenge by their name?
of the item that was just picked up
and then call a method with one of the arguments being the ID
I don't know the ID of the item, I want to detect *any* item pickup
oh
I don't see any method to get a list of collectibles
what are you talking about?
works fine
<:isaac_angry:245063314898419712> ?
<@109624258317033472> http://i.imgur.com/cFw3teb.png
<@268036083827212290> what?
<@178160616194834432> it's `player.CanFly`, you forgot the capital C again hahaha
I want to call a method with the ID
<@223869207748542464> I don't know the ID of the item in the first place
I'll try with a custom item
Oh, right
hi
<@124088844181045249> it probably just doesnt work with custom items. thanks tho
Also, hello again!
```lua
local ferbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function ferbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED) then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +0.25;
    end
    
    if (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FLYING) then
      player.canFly = true;
    end
  end
  
  end
  ferbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, ferbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
```xml
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/">
<passive cache="flying speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png" />
</items>
```
Trying to add flight and nothings happening
Not to change it, but to define it for custom items
check count of items
how would I detect which item was just picked up?
<@203215784770535424> you can't change it
`Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, myMod:randomInteger(1, currentHighestIdNumber), spawnPosition, Vector(0,0), player):ToPickup().Price = 15` <@109624258317033472>
<@124088844181045249> how did you do it? it somehow doesnt work for me
Does anybody know where the gray icon for items to be seen in the pause menu is defined ?
I don't think so
Heeeh it's probably not, what am I saying
So, the price attribute of the pickup entity is cash price
<@116386733905412105> I think it's auto-generated from the item
Thanks robo-baby
Oooh like that
http://i.imgur.com/BrpbwG9.png
nice
they do
I'm talking about the icon like in the escape menu
cheak if they cost anything
there's only one image, and it's what's used in the top-left corner
It worked
http://i.imgur.com/fGxam27.png
well in the pyrokinesis example mod
Using your items.xml file (use the one for the sample mods as reference)
If you're not replacing an existing item, you're supposed to create one
can I edit the icon for my item?
I think `ShopItemId` is just the spot of the item in the actual shop
oh, here's a question
Price and shop item id under EntityPickup
lets give it a try thanks
http://i.imgur.com/tNBtDnH.png
the subtype is probably the item id
so try spawning 5, 150 and see what happens
a collectible is 5, 100 and a shop item is 5, 150
And collectibles is a varaint of pickups
actually collectibles and shop items have different IDs
Lua was made to make people feel pain
I think you can do it for pickups
yeah
Like, spawn an item with it having a price ?
probably not now
<@109624258317033472> what do you mean ?
I hate lua less than other languages
yo, might i ask something before you rip each others head off? is it possible to spawn a item as Shop item in lua?
Yeah
basically
Lua is made for modding
omg
I love lua ?
this conversation is starting to get tedious and annoying, like coding
I mean, for a modding API Lua is the best choice possible
"the rewards are all that matters
don't confuse the process with the output"
it was a reply
someone said they don't like lua so I said I don't like coding
Right ? x)
then dont confuse us with you
Yeah, but then you come into the modding chat and say "I don't like coding" ?
thanks!
You're allowed
That's fine
just that I don't
I'm not saying you don't like the process either
idk I'm not a painter
some people might be like that
^
"You dont like painting you only like the output"
And yeah the process is fun too
I already know I can do it though
By "rewarding" I mean that when your code finally works it feels good inside
Dude, I love the process as much as the result
I wish I had the full api, that'd be a trip
codding is good when u have antibirth api...
It trains your mind at solving problems
don't confuse the process with the output
the rewards are all that matters
Awesome, rewarding
hobby
boring, tedious
it's a total chore
Right ? Haha
love codding
I don't know how anyone can dislike coding, haha
weirdo
I like coding c:
Coding is awesome doe
what up "Saxarok"
oh, hi "melon"
such a pain in the ass
I don't like coding at all
That or they used `long` instead of `int`, I don't remember
Which meaaaans that it depends on your system, 32 bits or 64 bits
I saw no special handling of integers, so that means it's the same as C integers
Not extensively but
Well to be fair I read the source code for Lua no later than yesterday
i don't like Lua
idk
Also integers in Lua are 64 bits right ?
I guess that's not really hard to find though, you just cycle through all the bits in the bitmask and display what each bit does
Robo-baby disagrees
and toTear()...
Like tear flags haha
there is just a few things missing. Like key bindings.
and mod tools, obviously
Official mod support and the whole Lua API is the greatest thing
Yeah I totally agree
and custom rooms
I'm just glad the mod tools are a thing, really. Would really like to be able to edit the ways floors are made and stuff so we can make custom floors
Yeah
Its just that we have nothing to go off of thats bad. its pretty good otherwise
But if you're wondering how to do something ... good luck
So there's that
At least when you know what you're looking for you find it
terrible
too much talk about that already
they are
no
Oooooooh the docs, let's talk about that
And the docs
yeah
Also, coming from C++, Lua is ugh
Well no it's not
Riiiiight ? ?
naa all programmign is the exact same <:plum:259939492008296448>
The people just don't understand
Just because I'm a game developer, psh
XD
I got a bunch of requests for mods before I even made one mod
It looks more like a fake smile
its smug
<:plum:259939492008296448> Plum's face perfectly describes my friends saying that I should create this and that now, even though I only made one passive item.
yeah
You'll have to create a costume too
<@178160616194834432> good luck in modding dude!
Ninja'd haha
Now to give flight
*Now to add flight*
<:plum:259939492008296448>
?
Niiiice
mcamazing
?
:)
IT MCWORKS!
Well that's stupid
yes
Really ?
dude
just default paint.net
In any reasonable manner
I'm surprised that anybody would save in CYMK
oh
and it works
working?
I'm using 32
use 16
no
yeah. when saving it it says on the side 32-16-8 chose 32
u need to convert cymk to rgb
but
idk how to do that in paint.net
I used paint.net
No
dude do u have photoshop?
Like.... what
I used isaac coulours straight from the game.
use rgb instead of cymk
What do you mean? Resolution?
oh
lower the bits from 64 to 32
You did a thing haha
I mean, it's something
don't put collectibles in gfxroot
do that
``gfx/items/``
Somewhere easier to find than a Reddit post haha
```xml
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items/collectibles">
<passive cache="speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" soulhearts="0" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png" />
</items>
``` Still have no clue why the graphic dosen't appear
on reddit
We need a central place for this shit
Is it somewhere online ?
jugen made that actually strimmer
users made that
That's RIP
i know
in enums.lua
it's not defined
actually
yeah
Surely it must be defined somewhere
users made that
Ooooooooooooooooh
use that

TearFlags is a global
When you do `TearFlags.TEAR_POISONING`
idk wher, but it works
nice
so if you pick it up two times, it does get added to the list two times?
I still don't know where `TearFlags` is
by checking number of collectibles
including picking it up multiple times
what is the best way to detect item pickup?
no
Do I add collectibles to the gfxroot?
Sorry
I meant collectibles.
it should be in modfolder/resources/gfx/items/collectibles/
do gfx/items/collectibles
gfx/items/passive ... I think I know the problem
i was about to say that xdd
where is it located?
oh,
Dude remember the formatting x)
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items">
<passive cache="speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" soulhearts="0" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png" />
</items>

The name of the item = collectibles_hoverboard     and it's in the .png format.
do the effect of item?
that works
player:FireTear()
we can do FireTear(), but how can we do this for monstro's lung or 20/20, etc?
my code
```lua
        PoopshootTear = player:FireTear(e.Position, e.Velocity, false, false, true);
        PoopshootTear:ChangeVariant(783);
        PoopshootTear:GetSprite():Play("normal", true);
        PoopshootTear.TearFlags = Poopshoot.TearFlags | TearFlags.TEAR_POISONING;
```
You might as well post it here haha
<@178160616194834432> make sure your items.xml is correct

*And when I spawn the item on a pedistal, it has no texture!*
Heeeeh there's no TearFlags either
there's no Entity:ToTear()
Oh EntityTear
maybe
uh, https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_entity_tear.html#a06f4334506d2503a3c9501ebaf1dc64b
I see TearVariant but that's it
Anyway yeah <@223869207748542464> where is TearFlags defined ? I can't find it in the doc
Haha it's fine
<@203215784770535424> helped you much better than me
No problem
np
np
Thanks guys! The mod works now! *time to try adding flight and a costume!*
but forgot about it
RIP haha
i replaced Poopshoot with PoopshootTear
error
i found
Where is TearFlags defined though ?
lol
ok
There's no problem here
i have tearflag table
``Poopshoot.TearFlags = Poopshoot.TearFlags | TearFlags.TEAR_POISONING;`` What is wrong?
Keep that for class names, and since it's Lua I guess also methods and member variables
If you want my opinion on this, never call a variable with a name starting with a capital letter
```lua
local FerbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function FerbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
    end
    end
  end
  FerbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, FerbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
I've been programming for 10 years, I have the eyes for this shit
*Burns cache*
I hate cache
Shit happens haha
...
lol
You called your parameter `CacheFlag` with a capital C and then in your function you use `cacheFlag` with a lowercase C
```lua
local FerbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function FerbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, CacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
   player:EvaluateItems()
    end
  end
  FerbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, FerbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```this is shitty, but try it
Oooh there's a casing error
No no it does
Unless I messed up and luamod dosn't do what I think it does.
I tried that. *Nothing happened*. I used luamod to refresh the code but nothing happened
yes
oh
But ye
He means `player:EvaluateItems()`
after ``player.Movespeed...``
try to ``entityPlayer:EvaluateItems()``
on why it's not
Any ideas?
```lua
local FerbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function FerbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, CacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
    end
    end
  end
  FerbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, FerbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
It should increase speed
RIP
<@116386733905412105> Thanks!! I worked  a lot this days to made the HUD
I love it when a tutorial tells you how to do something, only to show the videomaker test his item and it fails. Then, they stop recording when they fix their script

It's a pill that fires a Monstro's Lung-type Red Candle flames burst
That was quick

<@178160616194834432> u can try to ``entityPlayer:EvaluateItems()``
I made my first mod today, so I feel you
Everyone has to begin somewhere
*o ok*
Nah bro
*I bet I look like a right twat*
That too
for that use http://hastebin.com
Because the syntax highlight does a part of the analyzing work
Okay, the game no longer crashes. It dosen't give me speed though... <:plum:259939492008296448>
don't use it for more than a few lines
<@&205855326266720256> you might want to pin an information post about this, it can even help finding syntax errors in code
I feel like it's not yknow
is it hard?
\`\`\`insert language here
insert code of the language here
\`\`\`
Basically
or replace Lua with xml
It's not so hard
When you want to post your code, be it Lua or XML, use the following syntax with **backwards quotes** (aka grave accents) to enable automated syntax highlighting and formatting (it makes your code pretty and makes it easier for people to read it and find what's wrong with it) :

\`\`\`Lua
insert Lua code here
\`\`\`

Or if it's XML :

\`\`\`XML
insert XML code here
\`\`\`
Backslash before every quote then haha
this is for 1 line
Backslash before the quote
yeah
``
There you go
\`test\`
oh
/* lol */
I don't know to be honest
RIP haha
``test``
HOW TO WRITE THIS?!?!
XML is like HTML in terms of formatting, and I'm decent at formatting HTML
people don't know how
Even for Lua and XML
When there's delicious syntax highlighting available
I see too many people just posting their code with no formatting
lol
I'm surprised I forgot the /
Someone needs to pin the use of triple back quotes haha
Not sure what the `soulhearts = 0` is for but it can't hurt I guess
```xml
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
<passive cache="speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png" />
</items>
```
that ending slash is super important
Notice the slash at the end of the `passive` tag and the closing `items` tag
It should be this :
```XML
<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items">
<passive cache="speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" soulhearts="0" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png" />
</items>
```
u need to remove that
yes
Also your XML is wrong
The modding tutorial said I need that, though I think I can remove it.
<@218390040928059392> that's a lot of pixel work!
why soulhearts="0"?
And yes that probably fixes your problem
Like so
```Lua
local FerbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function FerbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, CacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
    end
    end
  end
  FerbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, FerbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
```
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837414680 Uploaded, take a look ?
You can surround your code with triple grave accents to format it
yeah
Also XML

<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/items">
<passive cache="speed" name="Hoverboard" description="It McFlys!" soulhearts="0" gfx="collectibles_hoverboard.png">
Like this?
local FerbsHoverboard = RegisterMod("Hoverboard",1)
local Hoverboard = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Hoverboard")

function FerbsHoverboard:CacheUpdate(player, CacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Hoverboard) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed +2;
    end
    end
  end
  FerbsHoverboard:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, FerbsHoverboard.CacheUpdate)
<@178160616194834432> tl;dr move the definition of your `player` variable inside your callback function
if your xml has an error in it, it can crash the game
screenshot isn't loading
"when the mod is first loaded" is in the Mods menu, when you first enable it, so there's no player
And then it's never updated
<@178160616194834432> can you show us the code in discord chat, not in screenshot?
The code outside the function is ran when the mod is first loaded, so player is nil
You need to create your player variable inside of your function
i've had someone whose items.xml crashed the game for some reason
This can't work
have you tried removing items.xml?
Okay now I have no clue why this isn't working
Well that's RIP
uploading mod x'D
the game:getlevel() returns a nil value apparently
A+=1 Narx=0
there are no animations :/ welp
isaac@nicalis.com or tyrone@nicalis.com
or email him
about it
tweet at tyrone
I think it's for when you want to make angel rooms prevail over devil deal rooms
That's weird
nope
but no general deal chance?
there's angel chance
yeah
actually, hmmm
it returns a nil value when i call it through a level:getdevilAngelRoom()
There's `AddAngelRoomChance(float)`
the level variable seems to have several problems
got it
yeah i looked there <@203215784770535424>
There are interesting things
<@235104838550159361> <@268036083827212290> you should look in the Level class
no menu animation here xD
The only animations I found containing me, in gfx
https://i.gyazo.com/65f3b88d698d1511c9eba2f22404b21b.png
and that just calculates it based on different stuff
I'm pretty sure it's not an actual stat
Room has `GetDevilRoomChance` but no setter
Alright
yeah np its just a test
I'm searching the doc
but cant seem to modify the devil/angel room chance
-0.5 is huge if I may
I see
i managed shotspeed and speed
my item is -02 speed , -0.5 shotspeed and +10% devil deal room and angel room chance
To have a Goat Head-type item ?
i mean in the luafile , i cant seem to find a function / attribute of a class that allows me to do that
item pool editor?
Hey guys , do you know how i could modify devil deal and angel room chances when i pick up my item ?
the character select screen is based off of CharacterMenu.anm2
anything with the word Menu
try
just keep searching xD
idk where it is xDD
layers on layers
and frames upon frames
YEAH
omg 2 many animations xD
okey
only on the windows version
supplied in tools/
with the animation editor
hot to edit .anm2 files?
shet indeed
shet
or you'll spend 2 hours asking for every single basic thing
<@178160616194834432> you should really read a tutorial
empty slots are just blank colors in the corners
it's probably part of the .anm2 file
Do you know where is this overlay? it is not splashes
Thanks, let try this again! *Braces for error*
for a split second i thought that was game maker 8
and MyMod in another spot
your mod is called FerbsHoverboard in one spot
and also
anyway you want to add your callback outside of any functions
whew.
SORRY CAPS LOCK
PAST THE BOTTOM END
MOVE YOUR CALLBACK
Just how do I make this work? What goes where? What needs to be added or removed? If I can make one basic script with some help, I should be able to figure some more basic stuff, and slowly build up using previous knowledge and the internet.
first two are PIL and getting started on lua.org
third result for "lua tutorial" https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/
I was following a video, line for line, and the guy fucked up, but then didn't show how he fixed it
you won't go far without basic knowledge
not to insult you or anything but have you tried first reading a comprehensible lua tutorial?
Well <:friends:260197422938980352>
it's worse
no
um
and saves
This better? I'll try it in a se
Okay I got a good setup now, just ctrl+b and it builds from multiple moonscript files to a single main.lua
its ok
I'm dumb
actually, yeah, forget what I said
hence why it crosses out the first definition as it's irrelevant
you're defining `local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)` when you already get `player` in the function
the reason is that it's a duplicate deifnition
add `Ferbs` before `Hoverboard` in line 11
that's not the reason
no
that's why it's crossed out
what do you mean
it gets defined the line after
Yeah, also, player doesn't exist at that point
<@178160616194834432> you're running AddCallback to add the CacheUpdate callback inside the CacheUpdate callback
On line 4, player is lined out. Not sure what that means
Not sure if I put the ends right. Again I'm new, young, and slightly retarded so.
Crashed again! <:isaac_cute:231218432148766720>
I see. Thanks <@268036083827212290>. I'm new to Lua so...
for the `if player:HasCollectible...` and the function
you're missing two `end`s
Game crashes when I open it

Can someone help me? I have a runtime error in my script.
although it does modify the global environment, so a better idea is probably to completely rewrite it with loadfile
like, really, really, really not hard at all
it's really not hard to make it not load C modules
I hope they make require actually work soon
instead of copy pasting
I can have it in its separate file and copy it over to any mod I want
for example, if I want to write a little `print` alternative that uses Isaac.DebugString but otherwise works the same as the normal lua one
I guess you can, yeah
I prefer to have files separated
eh
but that depends on the editor
well you can set it up to run it for you on save
update to the mod
every time you edit a script?
what do you mean every update
eh, nvm
what do you mean
Sure, it's not too much, but also not that importiant
what?
It's too much effort because you have to do it every update in addition to downloading the software
They're trying to sandbox it because require can load .dll/.so shared libraries, so they removed it for now
<@110125570452398080> apparently it's supposed to be a general lua thing, not just for ab+
I will say its a nice tool for now, but its going to quickly become irrelevant once `require` is fixed
<@116386733905412105> anyway, I don't understand what you mean by "too much effort", you just setup your editor to run `luamerger src/ -o main.lua` for you
all the files anymore
you don't have to list
wow, nice
same
that's different
`luamerger src/ -o result.lua`
it's just one comma~ wait
I don't understand what you mean by "too much effort"
lua is my favorite language actually
and having to copy and paste modules
if I just stand still I'm invincible to your opinion
having hundreds of lines in simple files
oh good robobaby says I found the gnawed leaf
I assume you've never written in lua before?
really not that bad.
even for small mods
it's annoying
yeah but you still end up with hundreds of lines in a file
and it will minimize all the lines in between
I can just hit a little arrow next to the function header or the if block or whatever
it just runs `luamerger src/ -o result.lua`
like
idk, if you look at the example
when you can just automatically hide sections of code with your text editor
to separate your files
seems like a lot of effort
last commit 5 minutes ago
u wot
and then at the end you call `luamerger` with some arguments to create an autogenerated main.lua out of all your files
it lets you use `require`
found it here https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n7xto/linuxmac_only_luamerger_a_simple_lua_script/?ref=search_posts
tf is that
I wish luamerger was a bit easier to automate
you unlock beat it by michael jackson
but if you kill the hush
otherwise it spawns the hush
and you have to shake the wiimote to the beat of the music
and guitar hero symbols start sliding across the screen
it plays the song thriller
and then
It'll be like a suicide dance, since the charmed enemies will kill the dancer
***it's evolving***
*oh no*
Dancing enemies charm nearby enemies
or a transformation that randomly causes enemies in the room to 'dance'
I have damage and other random animations to do for my character
Except for bosses, which get a minor speed up :>
I'm not gonna make it, so if anybody wants that then go for it
Makes all enemies walk back and forth in a pattern
yeah
Like a more specific confusion
Could be an active item
haha
like in the thriller video
to make the enemy walk back and forth
your tears have a chance
wait wait wait
make the enemies go backwards too
Yeah, it's the design law of isaac. With every disadvantage there should be an equal and opposite advantage
it would be interesting to see a mechanic like that in a char
Not with **every** tear being special
probably a tears up or damage up too
Maybe confusion?
I had an item idea earlier: Moon Boots "Thrilling!"
You always face in the opposite direction of your movement, your walk animation plays backwards, and you always shoot tears in the opposite direction of your movement (in the direction you're facing). Every tear is a "Fear shot" tear.
Works like a holy mantle, except the first time you get hit it deals damage and sets the enemy that hit you on fire if it was contact damage
**Gasoline** *"Human Torch"*
Also just got an item idea
alright, now she properly interacts with the black candle
hey, i didnt complain, i just said it didnt work xD
*I mean, why read the docs thoroughly when we can complaing about API not supporting features?*
thanks ^^
wow. Didnt even knew that function existed
ok
nop
Did you also try `GetGridCollision`? :P
dude, it doesnt work. atleast not in the patch i tried it on, there were several posts on the reddits that confirmed that ^^
ofc not
(I mostly mean the `:`, but the `GridEntity` part is also relevant)
You weren't calling it like `GridEntity.GetType()`, right?
Also
nothing. Ive found my workaround ^^
What exactly do you want to do?
Well, first of all
so its really not that possible to do it correctly
and getType doesnt work
There's a function that can check if there are any obstacles between two points
decorations on the ground count as gridentity
But, depending on what you want to do
Rocks can be done too, by getting the gridentities
sorry
i meant rocks
Because if you mean actual room walls, I do that in Demon in a Bottle for the bouncing
yeah
in the lua I know
<@120355885615808512> you have to add costumes manually
Are you talking about actual room walls? Or any obstacles?
<@109624258317033472> What do you mean by checking where walls are?
the costume didn't appear
but with none
I did the same
I had type as 'passive' rather than 'none', which seemed to fix it
I found out what the costume crash was btw
and then you just checked positions and saw if the ghost is in front of a rock and then you turn it left or right
?
wow
oh
xD
i did it by checking the room file where i put rocks and hardcoded the tiles
nice
lol
last i checked GridEntity.GetType() returned always nil
i dont know if checking where walls are is possible atm
oh yeah
like checking where walls are
becuase I wondered how you scripted the pacman ghosts
haha okay
dunno o.o
just write all the stuff in NPC_UPDATE
well, its not some kind of magic. Let them move, use Entity.Velocity to move it, give it a target it moves to....
whatever ?
ok then copying
you cant override behaviour
i dont think thats possible
what would I do
When I just wanted to change the ai of a existing enemy
what do you mean?
hm btw Scayze where do you start with scripting ai?
but i wish
nop
we cannot change/add floor generating mechanics atm right?
It's a neat idea
additionally, she has a permanent curse that makes everything dark
she can't gain attack speed. instead, it increases her damage.
it's Toph from avatar: the last airbender
What does he do?
felt entirely balanced the whole way through
Yeah, without mantle it's more irritating than anything
just beat the final boss with my custom character
?
lost is one of my favorite characters atm
?
but lost with holy mantle is actually fun to play
no it's not
and idk why people say that lost without holy mantle is near impossible
?
does anyone use atom with Atom-boilua ?
i like playing lost very much, so... COOL ITEM!
haha
dude, for all characters but lost it would be shit
Super high risk/reward type of deal
It sounds really fun TBH
But I think it's fine, because only in the devil pool
It's a fun item though
so, less than average for me
In my playtesting I got like a 50% success rate with it from the start
ok
No, those you do get
and soul/black hearts given by items is also deleted?
But people absolutely hated it without the mantle
how it relates
And yeah, I though about the lost
Also no, max 3 containers
Dunno
Because if so, that's insane-- oh ok. Still, depending on who you ask a lot of people will say OP. Maybe 2 items + stats? That's still really solid IMO considering characters like The Lost
so, there is no way to get more than 3 heart conrainers?
it also only spawns in the devil item pool
no
Can you still get Soul Hearts/Black Hearts?
that's op yo
Also, people are saying my item that gives you 4 random items and an all stats upgrade, but max 3 full hearts at any time and all heart pickups turn into coins is op, but is it really? Not having any more hearts for the rest of the run is pretty crippling.
In the docs for the "SetStage" function, it says:
"for SetStage/SetNextStage to have effect, call Init afterward"

What init are they talking about?????
yea overread it
If you don't know what they would name it, just read all names
I searched for GridEntityAmount or count
I don't know what exactly does it return, I always used width and height separately, because that I always needed
I just didn't know what they would name it
lol
Room::GetGridEntity    (    integer     Index    )
Can't you read the docs
just
dude
so it gives you the amount of tiles?
searched for something like this
ty
gridsize? didn't know about that one
You can get all gridentities by iterating from 1 to gridsize
Isn't every tile a gridentity basically?
dude
<@120355885615808512> What do you mean by that?
there's no getgridentities function so..
quick question is this channel about modding talk or can i ask for installing help?
coulden't you do it the same way you do entites?
someone found out how to search through gridentities?
Is this valid?
Ooooh

Woob maybe you could use EntityPickup
ye
stuff like that leads to 5.100 using subtype for item ID, etc etc
stuff like that leads to EntityNPC.V1 and EntityNPC.V2
Brother Bobby is just an instance of EntityFamiliar
instead of, for example, brother bobby being a subclass of EntityFamiliar which is a subclass of Entity
Talking about how there are just a couple of Entity**X** classes that subclass from Entity
Not talking about that
Nah that's actually pretty normal
Does GridEntity.GetType() work now?
man, Isaac's code is not designed well ?
either that or it gives you a weird, potentially harmful state
Yeah, but I think it returns nil for non-NPC entities
Though I haven't tested that function
¯\_(?)_/¯
can you ToNPC any entity?
Ooooh nice
`AnimWalkFrame (string HorizontalAnim, string VerticalAnim, float SpeedThreshold)`
oh they automatically flip?
Or are you just going to have them moonwalking sideways?
That changes as they change directions?
So that they have walking animations for up/down and left/right?
can just :Play
why would you need that though?
AnimWalkFrame
ye
EntityNPC has a function that animates walking, doesn't it?
BTW
Ah, right, I forgot Doctor Mario there :D
Nice ?
They are actually inspired by the viruses from Doctor Mario, which are themselves the inspiration for the enemies in Superstar Saga
Reminds me of Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga
huh
I got my first enemy working :^) https://gfycat.com/WelllitSaltyBlacknorwegianelkhound
and to spawn items with the same cost
oh i see
to detect items with a cost
what do you need exactly ?
<@268036083827212290> maybe? if you spawn a 5.150 in a Devil room the cost is hearts and it takes from the devil pool
thank you!
but still retains the cost???
it turns into 5.100
<@229593818691928067> it seems like the moment you spawn it
TakeDamage?
What command hurts Isaac?
<@268036083827212290> entity 5.150 spawns a shop item
I1 and I2 are just a straight up mystery though
@jellonator. thats what im hoping for, but ill try
about costumes and itempools
have you guys seen the new vid by Lytebringr?
If I had to guess, V1 and V2 are target positions since they are vectors?
instead of subclassing
could be
pretty sure it's bad programming and they're just arbitrary two vectors for usage in AI
i was being sarcastic
I'm gonna go with Scayze on this one. We can tell that it has something to do with AI, but beyond that, the doc does nothing to tell what they do
good question Woob
> general usage for ai_* functions, initialized to (0,0)
yeah xD
how do you spawn a collectible with an attached cost?
<@109624258317033472> the doc explains perfectly what they are hehe
and serious? ^^
?
v2 is a total tool though
I met npc.v1, he's a pretty cool guy
Does anyone know what EntityNPC.V1 and EntityNPC.V2 are?
<@116386733905412105> I'm not really seeing what you mean with the unpacked items.xml, granted I unpacked the first day, has anything been added since?
alright
use a global one
also, its not causing the crash, but if you set a local variable to false in resetcostumes(), it will be forgotten after the function
check the unpacked items.xml
oh really?
via items.xml
I think you can just add the costume
is there anything I've messed up?
hey, could someone give me a hand quickly and check some code? I'm trying to give the player a costume on item pickup, but currently it crashes. Here's relevant code from my main file. https://hastebin.com/uvotakuhuf.lua
ok
<@223869207748542464> i dont see why not.
<@229593818691928067> ok, fair enough I'll have a think about how I can detect it manually then thanks
will this work?
```lua
function sugmod:debug_text(text, x, y)
    Isaac.RenderText(text, x, y, 0, 160, 255, 255)
end
```
i had to detect it manually
<@247117031575519232> i had this problem with an orbital and i couldn't find a Collision rule that worked...
ok will do. I know there is an EntityCollisionClass but I tried setting that to collide with everything just to test but it stil didn't register any collisions. I'll have another look int it though thanks
check the documentation
aren't there colliding methods/variables on entities?
uh
do you know how I would do that? (Sorry, quite new to lua)
check the collision manually?
Does anyone know how to detect when a familiar is hit with an enemy tear yet? I can't find anything online about it, and none of the mods in the workshop seem to use it. Tears go straight through my familiar so I haven't been able to replicate anything like dry baby/big fan that soak up enemy tears
must be coincidence.
Because that shouldn't really be possible
Sure it's not a coincidence?
if not exactly the same
are similar to other runs with my mod loaded
it feels as if the items I collect throughout the course of the game
with my mod loaded
I mean, while playing the game
Is there better documentation yet?
You mean like in the item pools?
it just feels like I always get the same items when I play my mod
I don't use any randomization
If it's math.random you use it won't be seeded. Random() is a global function from the game that should work.
my code doesn't touch the seeds or rng at all
Is it seeded?
do I have to manually reset the rng or something
it feels like I always get the same items when I use my mod
I'll just link it http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835650828
should have 4 stars
and it's the first one with ratings
go to Collections
uh
Someone should make a `700,000` items mod full of shitty auto-generated items and enemies
is there a way i can search by name? i am having trouble finding the example mods.
okay.
just create a directory and put in your files in the same structure as one of the example mods.
your own mod will be located in this same folder.
Okay.
this will download them to C:/Documents/My Games/Binding Of Isaac Rebirth+ Mods
then run the binding of isaac
to install them, hit the green plus/subscribe button
Alright let me go look for them.
these are great examples.
there is a collection of mods created BY Nicalis
yes, if you go to "Collections"
so in the steam workshop?
the next step is to look for an example mod that adds items to the game
alright so you want to add items to the game
i know i need to make the sprites my self.
Just adding a few new items
the idea is first.
well what do you want your new mod to be?
Where do you get started with modding afterbirth+ i know about the tools and there location but i do not know how to start creating a new mod i already used the extractor...*and yes i do have LUA knowledge*
it's weired
<@120547369761767428> yeah
let me check
The Nicalis Curse example is a bit weird though
didn't realize they came out with more
oh goody
they have an example for adding a character, portrait and all
guys, for the millionth time, check the nicalis sample mods ?
you can select it as normal though
but it doesn't get the custom nameplate and stuff
it creates the slot/space for my character
with names on the menu and all
Is there curently a way to add new charachters ?
wait so what's the normal way to have a character start with a custom item
nvm I did it
so it's a regular entity?
no
mmm is it a GridEntity type?
is it possible to detect empty item pedestals?
Why would you bring me into this cruel world papi
How did the pig tracks get on the ceiling?
why can't I hold all these oranges
Why can't I make bosses from scratch, even with LUA
And items
And floors too
Why cant i just make enemies on the fly
Yeah
What's this LUA crap? Where's my 'Make mod' button?
what's your error?
has anyone gotten PlaySound to work..?
lol
*sigh*
Pitch Black has endstage=6
for example Flooded caves has id 6
that's not eLevelStages
Have you tried `stages.xml`?
*sigh*
are `endstage`s documented anywhere?
I will admit I didn't even search
thanks
lol
Oh, idk, like, `Isaac.GetChallengeIdByName`?
to get the name of the challenge
but that returns the ID, I assumed there'd be something
`game.Challenge`?
I mean
*sigh*
how can you get the current challenge?
but, when you pass arguments to a function, that information is not lost
like "real" length
when you create a table, you create a table object and that's it, some information is lost
because it can know how many arguments you passed
It makes sense though
But I guess it's good to know
Conform to Lua logic
Yeah, but you'd expect it to, y'know
how that behavior is also present in the normal `print`
you will note
<@126590786945941504> it's a Lua builtin, implemented in C
Weird how select works with `nil`
dat credits haha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZuLfyoxBT8
Are you sure `select` will work with `nil` tho?
the size of the lua table `{"A", nil, "B"}` is 1
exactly
hmhmhm
I misunderstood, I'm an idiot
Oh wait
And about the casts... Just try it! ¯\_(?)_/¯
You're only going to print out whatever is passed
(or ipairs)
If you do `for k, v in pairs{...} do`
Nonono
is ToFamiliar, ToKnife etc. a normal cast (so, error if it isn't really a knife/familiar/etc) or a reinterpret cast (if you use it on a custom entity, you can make it into an EntityFamiliar)?
`print("A", nil, "B")` is a good example too
but if you use `{...}`, you're gonna print out just a new line
`print(nil)` should print out `nil`
still
whoops wasn't scrolled down
<@126590786945941504> but you don't want to use `{...}`
Setting the fire delay outside the evaluation every evaluation worked for me though, like the next frame
I had to work around that
MaxFireDelay Evaluation is bugged I believe
is MaxFireDelay bugged
I guess I *could*, but does the mod tools allow you to add custom sfx files yet? Regardless, I'm not sure what sound I'd use for this lol
Stop, it's hammer time
<@130436472196038656> you should have a sound effect when it activates
there's nothing about it on Sprite so i assume it just isn't supported
:/
Well, I haven't found a way except for AnimateCollectible
yeah that
Are you talking about null layers in animations or what?
Then what do you mean?
https://youtu.be/of5F8omaM7g
no i don't see them in the docs
As in, do the docs refer to what you're talking about as null animations?
Is it referred to as null animations?
Just to be sure
Hold on
...what
do you know how to use Null animations ?
I remember looking for it back with the brimbombs
Was that added in an update
What the blin
...DepthOffset
DepthOffset works
the RenderZOffset doesn't seem to do anything
oh ok
They also get rendered over lighting effects and such
**but**
So they get rendered over everything else
eh
That gets called after the whole game is rendered
You can render them in POST_RENDER yourself
Well, here's the thing
<@126590786945941504> do you know how to make an entity render on top of others even though they're higher in the room ?
it seems to work too!
some items probably increase the cooldown
I thought it was to change the damagecooldown for every damage taken
Isn't it relevant here? :P
EntityPlayer
player
I wonder too
on what class ?
How does SetMinDamageCooldown work?
great :p
hmhmhm
Works like a charm!
I'll try that thanks !
Wow that would be clever !
you could return false to nullify the damage then do `TakeDamage (float Damage (0), integer Flags, EntityRef Source, integer DamageCountdown)`
It's the question lol
or is that the question ? lol
well couldn't you replicate the 30 frames of invicibility?
I want to cancel damages (so i return false in MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback), in order to code my own behavior for damages, but the problem is that is doesn't activate the 30 frames invincibility, so the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG is called again the next frame (if i'm still touching the enemy for example). ,So is there a way to set the DamageCooldown on the player ?
already did it a few days ago ^^
you could ask on r/themoddingofisaac ?
4 haha
he asked about ten times already
lol
And what is your problem?
Any idea about my problem ? :/
I can test more if you give me the entire mod ¯\_(?)_/¯
and it does the item's effect
I can still give the item
Like the mod being disabled
Or it's something stupidly obvious
Well, I'd say that either the rest of your code is borked, the item definition is borked or you missed the error in log.txt
it works with other things anyway
I didn't make that lol
You do know that `{...}` returns an array?
well try without the nuclearresidue arg
BTW
ah
```lua
local function print(...)
    local str, sep = "", ""
    for i=1, select('#', ...) do
        str = str .. sep .. tostring(select(i, ...))
        sep = '\t'
    end
    return Isaac.DebugString(str)
end```
Wait, does `print` work in AB+?
`local nuclearresidue = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Nuclear Residue")
`
```lua
function mod:CacheEvaluation(player, flags)
    print(flags)
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, mod.CacheEvaluation, nuclearresidue)```
Can I see your code?
hmm
no it's not
Also, that's not your entire items.xml, is it?
nope
Nothing in the log.txt?
`<passive cache="firedelay" description="You taste funny!" gfx="collectibles_thebutton.png" name="Nuclear Residue" />`
What's your items.xml?
I put the cache value in the items.xml
hmm it's still not running it
But from what I know, it'll work fine if you don't, if you need to do external stat modification
That is, the player has your item and one of your item's caches are evaluated
Well, if you do, then it only gets called when relevant
so do you have to pass your item id when adding the callback?
it will also despawn familiars if there's the familiar cache
From what I understand it just goes ahead, resets your stat to 0 and reapplies every item that modifies that stat
Say, pills, or mods
But sometimes other things might require that
This happens when you pick up an item that caches the same thing
The callback runs every time one of the caches from the item you hooked to has to be evaluated
in the items.xml
one that has a cache value
Not exactly, it's more complicated
but shouldn't the callback run every time you pick up an item
o
And set the cache in your passive item?
And checked your log.txt for errors?
You did read enums.lua, right?
also, are there any arguments that have to be passed into evaluate cache, cause it's not running for me
<@128874748041101312> I'm too lazy to make one right now, just download one from the workshop
Hi everyone ! Is there a way to set the DamageCooldown of the character when taking damages with MC_ENTIY_TAKE_DMG but canceling them ?  I means, I want to cancel damage and code my own behavior for the TAKE_DMG but if I cancel the damages, the character doesn't enter in invicibility frames mode
<@126590786945941504> how'd you make it a certain item that does that though?
I feel like I'm looking at either something I wouldn't understand, obviously broken functions or I'm just doing stupid stuff and spouting out nonsense
So it's getting interesting
If I replace `t2` with something else it says that I passed an invalid thing
It crashes the game
```lua
local t = ItemConfig.Config.__class
local t2
for k in pairs(t) do
    if type(k) == "userdata" then
        t2 = k
        break
    end
end

log(t.GetCollectibles(t2))```
BTW
Though these days you don't do that yourself and use forge, which loads stuff from other jars with its API
ah, you mean that
Yeah
By replacing classes inside the jar
Also, the way it works with minecraft is that you literally edit the game file
Sure, he can replace stuff from the game and with enough work and knowledge he can read pseudo-code or assembly from the game
That's nowhere near "open-source isaac"
i mean that
yes
has*
Kilburn has a C++ code injection API made for Isaac that he used in antibirth
Kilburn isn't making "open-source isaac"
Nevermind XD that's irrelevant
I'm not sure if I should try to keep the information straight or just get out and do what I was doing
erm
no
Coz isn't that how stuff like mine craft work s? Except with java
killburn is making open-source isaac...
yeah
That would be great
<@195237099316707328> if i could, i would do that too
Oh yeah, totally forgot that you can't just open up isaac.exe in visual studio XD
By injecting compiled code to run into the game and editting existing machine code
The closest to what you want is how antibirth works
And third
C++ isn't embeddable just like that
Oh yeah >~<
second, you couldn't load it like you load Lua mods
Does that mean that I could just change the source code and never even think about lua
yeah
First things first, the source isn't public
Well I'm studying game development
More specifically, compiling?
Do you have any idea how programming and C++ work?
what
Does that mean that I could just change the source code and never even think about lua
Wait, ya telling me it's in c++?
Ahhh ok, fair enough
just good to know it
so
isaac is coded in c++
good lang btw
and also try to learn c++
and for modding
https://www.youtube.com/user/ClipsNTips
Yeah lol... it's always kinda been in my bucket list, but I never got around to learning any languages, and now I'm regretting it with BoI modding ;~; thanks for the resources anyhow!
https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html
maybe
idk
0 coding experience
oh
<@142496152770576384> https://www.youtube.com/user/ClipsNTips
Do you guys have any specific guides/YT videos/sites that you'd suggest to somebody with 0 coding experience? 

I can do decent sprites, but I can't even code a passive item to save my life
You also define `cache = "teardelay"` or whatever the right name is for items.xml
```if cacheflag == teardelayflag then
    ply.teardelay = ply.teardelay - 1
end```
LIke, y'know
<@128874748041101312> I don't have an example, but you basically change stats when the appropriate flag is passed to EVALUATE_CACHE callback
guys, how to check if a tear collides with a enemy?
My first mod, hype
And there you have it, I have a created a red candle/monstro's lung pill xD
Also that fucking sweet code highlight is poppin'
```Lua
local dataPrint = RegisterMod("DataPrint", 1)
local candle = 289
local velocity = nil

function dataPrint:use(item, rng)
    velocity = nil
end

function dataPrint:display()
    local ents = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #ents do
        if ents[i].Variant == EffectVariant.RED_CANDLE_FLAME and velocity == nil then
            velocity = ents[i].Velocity:Length()
            break
        end
    end
    Isaac.RenderText(velocity or 0, 100, 150, 0, 255, 0, 255)
end

dataPrint:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dataPrint.use, candle)
dataPrint:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, dataPrint.display)
```
With Isaac standing perfectly still
can someone give me an example of a stat up/down item
<@126590786945941504> alright so as it turns out, flames spawn with a velocity of 14
polyphemus effect
Well, what are you trying to achieve?
guys, how to check if a tear collides with a enemy?
That's a better idea
Detect when a flame is spawned and print its velocity
Bleh
Or, just
I mean, if you know what the friction is, you could calculate it
I'll just try things and see
And yeah -_-
Lengh of the velocity vector that is
I'm not worried about the direction, just the length
Well, good luck finding that
Yeah I know, but ideally I'd want it to be the same than with the actual red candle
If you're spawning it red candle-style, it's the direction the player fired it
flameVelocity is the velocity you want the flame to have relative to the player :P
And does `flameVelocity` exist as a variable, 'cause I couldn't find it
<And I confirm that the Red Candle doesn't depend on shot speed>
Yeah I know that much, but the question is "what's `flameVelocity`"
Also, spawning flames would probably just be Isaac.Spawn with the flame ID, plyVelocity+flameVelocity as the velocity and player as the spawner
Yeah I could
Oh yeah you mean to see if changing shot speed chagnes a thing
And you'll clearly see
Fire a few times again
Give yourself 10 shot speed up items
Fire a few times
`debug 8` for infinite item uses
Spawn red candle
I mean
Why?
Well that would be hard to try haha
Well, try it ¯\_(?)_/¯
I think it's a set range that adds to Isaac's velocity
Red Candle doesn't use the shot speed stat does it ?
ctrl+F is a friend
Have you checked the entity docs?
the way im currently investigating is trying to detect if the Trapdoor animation is playing by the player. Do you know how to get the sprite of the player?

local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
local playerSprite = ???
And possibly no official/supported way
Or perhaps even 10 ways
I'm pretty sure there is a way to detect that
Also, is there some automagic to fire candle flames ? I feel like I shouldn't be redoing everything
That would be surprising
Is there a way to detect when Isaac jumps into a trap door to go down to the next level?
thanks dude
do ``URTEAR.Damage = player.Damage``
Hey so i made a tear and i can make isaac shoot it and all but the tear doesnt seem to be affected by player damage and always hits by 35
No problem o/
thanks
`MC_USE_ITEM`, that is
o
Make the mod callback return true
not forever, for like a second
how do you make the player hold the active item above their head
Answer is still yes
do mods still disable achievements***
i do mean the other way around
yes
JDOJOJf
You mean the other way around x)
yes
do achievements still disable mods?
okay so it's now adding +1 damage and stuff like that but it has no texture now either
I'm working on my own thing right now, sorry
DM me if you do
Now to find it
Yeah
not nessesarily accessible
Maybe that "somewhere" is just not exposed to the Lua API
I mean this is programming so yeah it's held somewhere
this is afterbirth+
>must
But the charge's value itself must be held somewhere
that's just how it works with charge items
I don't know, I'm just telling what I see
But it doesn't mean you can fire as soon as it hits 0
what then
Like, you can't fire until tear delay is < 0
That's tear delay
I think you've got the wrong stat
This is how it works with charges
RIP hahaha
i just crashed my game by spawning coplayer
I guess it would have something to do with `gridspawn`
It's somewhere in the debug console's manual
Heeeh don't know
how do i get it up on a pedestal
to make sure it works
ok i got +1 damage but
You could also invoke it by its full name instead of its ID
Start typing `giveitem Gri` and it should show it to you
Try to auto-complete its name
wait so how do i find its id
ok
That's the only way I know after my half-minute of experimenting haha
Enter the debug console and give it to yourself
Noice
nope
how do i spawn it in when i start a run?
No more runtime failure ?
now
ok so it worked so far
The slash is though haha
The space isn't important
and the space
oh fuck me
Notice the extra slash at the end
Should be this : `<passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png" />`
This : `<passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png">`
Not Lua code
Because what's failing is the C++ runtime, and it's the C++ code that reads the XML
huh
I didnt spot that
That might be it
Oh you forgot the closing / in your `passive` tag
dont know
hmm
ye still gettin that run time error
don't think that's the problem just fixed a thing
find it?
o wait
```<items version="1" gfxroot="gfx/Items">
 <passive cache="damage" name="Grill" description="Don't burn the burger!" gfx="grill.png">    
</items>```
That too yeah
Are you sure the error happens because of your mod ?
whast the .xml look like?
Well I can't see anything wrong
but yeah that's it
Remember, the thing !
soRRY
Use the thing to post the code !
The FireDelay doesn't work with charges
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
As of now
What's your complete code ?
Right ? Right ? xD

eventhoughitsreeealybad
Chill out it's a joke
let people do what they want
My C++ background doesn't agree haha
Also starting methods with an uppercase letter, ugh
yes
But yes it's the same thing
Ninja'd haha
It should be something like `if player:HasCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill"))` is my guess
so it should be ```local Grill = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")```
wait
uh ok
the name that should be in there is Phantombirth
Yes but in your code there is no variable named `Grill`
ok nevermind
i'm
what
wait
Grill is an item that just does +1 damage, it's defined in items.xml
`EntityPlayer::HasCollectible` takes a `CollectibleType` as a parameter
Is Grill defined anywhere ? What is it ?
Anyway yeah, that line : ` if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then`
```i did the thing```
`=grave key
You did a thing o/
hueh
grave key
Yus
```like this````
wrong button
ok i'm an idiot
It's backwards accents
no
'''like this'''
o
```
Like so
```
Also, you can wrap your code in triple `
I think the error is the HasCollectible line
are you caching the damage flag in the xml?
local MyMod = RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Phantombirth = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
I can try
hey so once more, can anyone check out my code and see what's wrong with it?
I can see that being potentially dangerous when different pills with the same id collide
Oh I see, so it's basically mimicing the way the game already works
They explain well on how to do things
https://www.youtube.com/user/Lytebringr/videos watch this guys tuturials.
yeah, that will be your new pill
And while PillEffect is indeed a class, it takes an integer that is supposed to be a member of the enum PillEffect
I was about to say, it doesn't look like I can since all pill types are listed in an enum
Huh alright
you can amke a new pill effect
The big question though, is, do I replace an existing pill type with my own or can I actually create additional pill types
Alright thanks, I will
melon plz
Sounds relatively simple. Here's a tip, <@203215784770535424>  :  Check Isaac.Spawn, EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT and EffectVariant.RED_CANDLE_FLAME
I know its not the API
Whooaaaat
where do you get this tool?
WHAT
wait
https://gfycat.com/LivelyGlaringChickadee
It's mostly to learn how the whole thing works
Let's see how that goes
A chili pill that does a red candle version of a monstro burst
Thanks, I'm trying to create a custom pill for starters
Anyways, I'm done for the day. GL with your modding!
Yes it does XD
Makes sense yeah
But when you start a floor, both values are the same.
<@269562360295849985> same. feels nice knowign how most of the items function
For example, I have a rather odd way of checking the start of a new floor.... It turns out, the game keeps track of the current room and previous room.
The whole modding thing, that is
I literally just arrived into this
Not the PITA part haha
Must feel good
I love this, though. I have a ridiculously good idea on how most of the basic engine behind Isaac works now -- except not all of it is exposed or practical, which makes some ideas a pain in the butt.
About Brimstone: I recommend making an on-screen log fuction to monitor the contents of EntityPlayer. FireDelay
God I hate this shit haha
In these two weeks I have probably spent more time figuring out what makes Isaac crash with my mods than actually playing!!!
Yeah ...
Trial and error. Lots of it. XD
there are plently of examples for that stuff
Alright, so I guess we're all alone for items.xml
The only one with any doc is challenges.xml, <@203215784770535424>
I'm not sure but one of them is a count down to 0
but can we get if it is charged or not
<@!194259969359478784> yeah, I'm fairly sertain thats just fire-deley and all those stat's
<well it's part of what I meant>
For items that you hold down to charge, can we get the charge state?
<@!194259969359478784> I imagen that would just be the fire delay stuff
That's what I meant, do we have specs for the XML files ?
What do you mean, <@!194259969359478784> ?
Ah. No, we don't have official documentation for that XD
Outside of the XML files and main.lua, a lo tof stuff is kinda flexible
?
Can we get the charge-up time for brimstone/lung/etc
Things like items.xml, and the general folders hierarchy to a mod
Which other packages? The tools?
Makes sense x)
Yeah. It's very likely a documentation error, or a misnamed/mislabeled  attribute/function. Either way, I had to use another variable (FamiliarEntity.State) to store directional movement information XD
Also, apart from the Lua docs, is every other package format and the like documented ?
Sounds like fun
Wow haha
I can tell you the perfect example: FamiliarEntity.LastDirection is a Direction, but it is not from the Direction enum. No idea what LastDirection does, but changing it crashes the game.
Thanks a lot for telling me about that log.txt file, it's just what I needed
Alright wooooh I fixed it
Right
hey i'm still getting the run error after selecting my mod in the mod's menu but my code seems to be just dandy
Other functions do require more documentation, though.
Not really. They're pretty much giving the source code, the functions reference existing API functions and the names are self-explanatory in this case.
Even more so because they're not in the SDK
And I mean even so, the functions defined somewhere else than in the SDK should be documented
Man I need to get used to this all
Makes sense
Oooh alright
THere is no such top-level function because it's a function in The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\scripts
I can't seem to find any doc for any top-level function at all
Also, where's the doc for `RegisterCallback` ? Because it's different than `Isaac.RegisterCallback`
It probably should, and I just haven't noticed because I multitask too much :V
even a small script should stutter
yeah, but I mean no stutter at all
It's the sample mod Tyrone posted haha
Aaaand nope, Pyrokinesis still doesn't work
Unless it's a really small script, then it will succeed almost instantly anyways XD
if something very small is mistyped in the code it won't output any errors. I find that if it says Succes instantly, then something is wrong
Alright I think I fixed everything
close the log file, reload the script, then depending on what your mod does, open the log again after a while
That I had *supposedly* fixed, hence the reloading
And yeah, the point of reloading it was that there was an error in it
^
depends on the error tho
It doesn't
also, if there is an error if the code it just goes...bleh
if the file has a space it wont work
It does say "Success !", but nothing has changed and the logs aren't modified
lowercase!
I know
luamod FOLDERNAMELOWERCASE
luamod [modname] no caps, no spaces. type it like the file name
Also, `luamod` in the console doesn't seem to be working that great
I'm blind
Oh shit it actually does
There's a log.txt in `My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+` (not the mods folder) but it has nothing related to Lua scripts in it
Also actually putting the 1 fixed the stupid text mod I wrote, but not Pyrokinesis
There isn't any in my mods folder or executable folder
Where is that supposed to be though ?
Some sort of stdout/stderr
Aaah that's what I wanted
Check the log.txt file
It not being there is just some leftover typo thing from previous tests
That doesn't fix anything, I've tried
the second must be a 1.
RegisterMod takes two parameters.
dunno how to help
o
Basically, mods seem to work fine up until the point where they do nothing upon use
I explained everything on the Reddit, if somebody would want to take a look that'd be greatly appreciated : https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5nvrm6/ab_mod_loads_and_shows_up_but_wont_run/
So that's pretty RIP
The thing is, I can't actually run any mods
eND ME IT STILL DIDN"T WORK
True x)
So you say you need help... I think we all need help. XD
Trivia: my first mod is currently clocking at 250 lines of code. I think I will hit 350 before  reaching a point in which it can be published. XD
that's a good point anatole
I am in need of some help
Helloes
you're missing the equals sign (=) after MyMod and before RegisterMod
okay so it didn't do anything, i still got the runtime error after i press escape on the mods menu after i've selected phantombirth
o
you are missing one end before the addcallback
local MyMod RegisterMod("Phantombirth",1)
local Phantombirth = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Grill")

function MyMod:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Grill) then
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 1;
    end
  end
  
  MyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, MyMod.CacheUpdate)
heyo can anybody tell me what's wrong with this line of code possibly
XD
hilarious
if you notice, whoever at nicalis made this mod inserted their own characters into the sprite sheet by deleting Isaac & Maggie
Oh well... Couldn't figure out how to add familiars to a chain of familiars... but at least everything else seems to work so far. Time to spice up those sprites...
(I know he went to bed but he can read this tomorrow :P)
you have to make a new animation on the .anm2 with the exact name of your character though or it won't work
as long as the .anm2 file looks right you're good
<@!267112861921181697> you can pretty much delete everything in the sprite sheet that you don't use and replace it with your own shit
rip sucka
ill figure it out tomorrow
its not working
Fuck
fuck pls
ill just edit this then
ok then
wait what
because right now its just editing old chars
h a l p p l s s s s
I remember using this to edit old characters but I don't see a place to edit them
how the h e c c am i supposed to add a new player with this weird file?
no wonder nobody else figured it out :P
it is!
that's a weird place to put it :/
thanks
"Custom Player" by AdrianGray
I don't want to go through the steam auth shit
can you tell me what its called?
fixed the url
there you go
oops
yup
wait wrong page
ok
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838994644
<@!267112861921181697> there is a mod "custom character" on the workshop by nicalis
follow their file structure and you can make the ui work
```function MyMod:use_faith( )
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.95 then
        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player.AddHearts(2)
        player.AddSoulHearts(1)
        player.AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```
But my code for false faith isn't working ;-;l
He has Punching Bag and an item I made called False Faith
Since Isaac is every other character, I tried to make him more sinsiter
cool
<@150336707609231362> I made Abraham, Isaac's Father in the biblical story
sorry, I don't know
pls senpai-chan
how did you get the picture and text to work?
hey guys
niiiiiice
yes
How? are you able to do that now?
yes, he did it
<@154701703474577408> did you add a character without changing a current one?
http://i.imgur.com/uQ2PNQK.png
(and to make the rest of the things that would be unlocks if we had custom achievements)
now I just need tyrone to add custom achievements
my mod looks like, actually like it is working now :D
I just got done adding my character portraits
OMG(Not my mod)
https://streamable.com/7xfrs
As for the last one... Mmmh. After taking damage from this, how much time must pass before Isaac can take damage again?
and the second argument should be probably something like DamageFlag.DAMAGE_INVINCIBLE
instead of dmgSourceEntity, use player. It's self-damage after all :V
dis gud?
```function MyMod:use_faith( )
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)\
    if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.75 then
        player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
    else 
        player.AddHearts(2)
        player.AddSoulHearts(1)
        player.AddBlackHearts(1)
    end
end```
No Familiar examples on the Nicalis sample mods. :V
Oh well.
Parameters are the same as those in the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG  callback, check that one out to see what to use as params
player:TakeDamage(2, 0, dmgSourceEntity, 0)
Character *portraits*. Though, you are right, I should check Nicalis's sample mods, there might be answers to common questions there.
do i do player.TakeDamage(2) for one heart?
so i was just clarifying ?
yeah but you said you didn't think there was a way to add characters yet
entity.TakeDamage()
it should be a function, right?
do damage real quick?
please
I am not the one making characters, though -- I'm the one making familiars XD
I want to do one heart of damage
how do you do damage to Isaac?
<@269562360295849985> you can actually add characters properly now, check nicalis's example mods
Meanwhile, in other news, I still have no idea how to make familiar chains. Has anyone else tried to make them?
Or at least those related to the item you make
Which means that if you run the same seed twice, and play the same way twice, the events will be different ?
D'oh, good point
Yes, but those are bound to the computer clock and not the Isaac seed, <@70946604139425792>
You wouldn't even need to use a preprovided function to, for example, get a random number between 0 and 3 (for a 25% chance)
For more events, you save the result of the RandomFloat() call and check against other probabilities.
so that makes a 75 percent chance
Doesn't lua have random functions already
ok
So if it generates a number between 0 and 0.75, that's one event. The else is the other one.
RandomFloat() returns a floating point number between 0 and 1
i think i have a variable for rng already
oh
if rng:RandomFloat() <= 0.75 then -- Probability of 75% of occurring.
s l o w d  o w n w h a t
Next, you use rng:RandomFloat() to check
how do I incorporate it into an if statement
Because right now we have nooooo waaaaay of getting the run seed for RNG, or anything for that matter
but like
I don't recommend *creating* an RNG object, but getting one from an existing object -- for example, entity:GetDropRNG()
ok
Good question. In game randomness is through the RNG() class.
the character that starts with it starts with only one black heart so it may be an important item
I'm making an item called False Faith the has a 75% chance to fail but if it works it heals you
if math random shit
like
Percentages? O_o
and 75% to fucking die
like 25% chance to execute this
how do you make an if statement that includes percentages
speaking of which
kk
<@!267112861921181697> I don't think there is a way to add images to the character select menus yet. Hopefully we'll have an answer when Tyrone actually finishes the Mod Megapost XD
run the unpacker in the tools folder then
i dont have that
What unpacked rooms folder?
that'll do it
just go to file -> import binary, then select the unpacked rooms folder
<@66197463593136128> Where do i have to import it to?
It worked, only there still isn't an image
Mmmh. Have you tried removing the id field, <@!267112861921181697> ?
has anyone figured out how to add graphics to the menu yet
```<players bigportraitroot="gfx/characters/costumes/" nameimageroot="gfx/characters/costumes/" portraitroot="gfx/characters/costumes/" root="gfx/characters/costumes/">
    <player bigportrait="PlayerPortraitBig_01_Abraham.png" bombs="0" black="2" id="16" items="281" name="Abraham" nameimage="PlayerName_01_Abraham.png" portrait="PlayerPortrait_0_Abraham.png" skin="Character_001_Abraham.png" skinColor="-1" />
</players>```
What's on your players.xml file, <@!267112861921181697> ?
¯\_(?)_/¯
help
whatever works
or you can use basement renovator
<@219612927831965697> you need to import stb's, it's in the file menu
and I only have one in my players.xml
theres double empty spaces than characters now
Mmmh. OK, it's gotten to the point I have *no idea* how to add a Familiar to the Familiar chain.
also
I don't see it anywhere
but wheres the image above that?
Like I know theres PlayerName
where are the character slect pictures?
also
be grateful for nicalis even thinking about that
So im trying to make a room using the room editor but ~~this one error keeps kicking my ass~~ Whenever i try to create a new room it crashes. please help
True. Much better than setting up all animations through code.
¯\_(?)_/¯
I like it because I don't have to animate by hand anymore
I dunno what he is talking about tbh
That's for Zoom tho
smh
Press control and scroll wheel
Center button? Also the Pan tool.

I dont mean the time line
and undoing would make stupid mistakes easier to remove than re-capture the size, the frame at the perfect scale 100 times
I've been able to scroll down in the timeline. ' ___ '
when you cant even scroll down
then its hard to pick something from the bottom
cough cough char menu
but when the image is big
I dont use it for sprite editing
Yeah. I make my sprites with an actual image editor, use AnimationEditor only to edit animations.
its supposed to be an animation editor, not a sprite editor
its pretty bad, its useable, but not great
there isnt even an undo option -.-
you can even move pictures down, only zoom in and out
<@130436472196038656> useing MC_POST_RENDER
its not ok
Fuck you robobab
Its k
I hate this animation editor
errmr, hang on
This is probably a *really* dumb question, but I want something to occur after a few second wait or a certain amount of in-game frames/updates, what do I need to do to accomplish something simple like that?
my b
I thought you had made an item then wanted to make a char start with it
I know
oh you dont need lua to give a char in players.xml a non-custom item
God sends message to sacarfice kiddo, kiddo almost killed, angel comes to rescue
basically the same thing Mom did in this games story
in the biblical story at least
I am giving my charcter Abraham, Punching Bag because of what he almost did to isaac
^
my artistic abillity is lacking
i make shoddy sprites --> make working code -> still have shoddy sprites
I make decent sprites, shitty code
I always make shoddy sprites -> code like mad -> refine sprites
at least I was told
They are fixed before you ask
I still need to make menu sprites
What I'm currently trying to figure out is, how to make a familiar fall in the good ol' chain of familiars. Not exactly an easy task imo.
can someone tell me when I am ready?
and a flag to make sure its not done repeatedly if you exit the run
my way was useing MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT
on run start?
can you tell me how to assign stats then?
^ also inconvenient, as item ids are assigned automatically
trying to add it useing player.xml just crashed the game
If it's a custom character or something else that requires modifying the character's starting status, you need to use Lua code
ill ask you then when I need it
for a custom item, that was the only way i managed it
that's dum
you can either give it directly or spawn it
I don't think so SiclaRogue
you need to put it in the lua ender
pedestal?
you need to spawn something?
Yeah
You know how to use the console?
how do I give a character a custom item?
nvm went full retard
nmv
what
player xml doesn't have the HP and shit
how do I make a new player?
I know how to retrive and manipulate data
is there any way to change the collision radius of an entity?
ermm
yeh i guess it dosent
that makes no sense <@166265383291060224>
And what is the curse item pool?
The thing that eats coins and gives you shit
King baby is in shops
ive no real knowledge of codeing passed creating code
Greed Bu,
it improves other familiars
but BFF is not a familiar
and coin bum?
Is that it?
BFF is
Do familiars get sold in shops?
When Isaac dies, its the ghost that comes out
I know
oh
<@!267112861921181697> what *is* ghost.png?
<@166265383291060224> json is just for serialization/deserialization
whats ghost.png for
or lua in general for that matter ?
I'll be honest im not well versed enough with  json to figure stuff like that out so ima have to just let it be broken for a while
?
I am a god
I have added a neckbeard to every isaac
or use something like luamerger
or paste in the whole code of the json module at the beginning of main.lua
you used to be able to `require("json")` to load a json lib shipped with isaac for easy serialization, but now `require` isn't exposed so you have to either make your own simple format
<@166265383291060224> there's API for saving and loading data
but it would explain why Void resets on exiting run too
cause i have a item that uses a var to check its 'effectiveness' so it would break if you exited the run
Abraham has some serious neckbeard
hmm, that seems odd
and I forgot to save it
but he's offline right now
<@126590786945941504> had finished code for detecting new runs
<@166265383291060224> I don't think so, no
hang on do vars get saved within temp saves?
i didnt think about that
oh yeah youll need to add a flag too
postplayerinit is called on continue
<@166265383291060224> that's not enough
np
and ty SiclaRogue
make his beard stick out
```Mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, Mod.GiveEternalhearts);```
oh god
it looks his neck is cut apart and shit is pouring out
why does he have a turd on his face ?
now comes the question which callback
and

e w
I guess
```function Mod:GiveEternalheart()
 local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
     if (player:GetPlayerType() == Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName("Isaac")) then
     player:AddEternalHearts(1)
    end
end```
maybe that was fixed idk
although I think I heard that most of them crash on the player
entity flags?
*hiss*
hmm, I suppose Azazel's flight is done via something else
you're gonna get a full heart; that's unlikely you might say but there are other scenarios
and you get the item on a run on your character thanks to eden's blessing
if I make an item that doubles passive items' stat changes
moving on
okay white hearts dont exist
for example
of not knowing if what you're doing is gonna actually do what you're doing
hang on
it dosent need to be an item
that's a terrible idea because you get into the territory
lua is too complicated for my sorted C# brain
just make an item that gives your char a eternal heart and then deletes itself
I cant lua
in that case I'd just do the new run thing
<@146600389779783680> you can add the heart useing lua
;~´
because no characters use it
it's possible that it doesn't exist
mhm
but you're just guessing?
its not
no
that `white` is already documented/used somewhere
I thought you meant
oh wait
but it does when I go directly to the url
when I search
why does EntityTear not show up
wait what
then probs angel
now "eternal"
I tested "white" and "holy" so far
and just give an eternal heart
detect new runs
if `white` really doesn't work then
but still tho
maybe
why would you do that
why
/s
you can just give him an item that gives him an eternal heart
`white` is for white pride
soul hearts are "armor" red hearts are "hp" black hearts are "black"
no I mean the one in the player.xml
half a heart
gives the player one eternal heart
``player:AddEternalHearts(1);``
gimme a sec
I have the code
wait
well
white is not the white heart... shiet
I am very shit at spriting
kk
its fine
is it any good
this is all I got so far
hmm maybe white?
in the player code
what could the white heart be
that's new
oooooh EntityTear?
hmmm
works kinda like a boomerang, but will be affected by stats
He is an angel so he will get his Arch Halo (which will be an item too), which he will be able to shoot
n O w I g N s
He will work a bit more unique
no
are you giving him a familiar like lilith?
n o w I n g s
yep, no shooting anymore
noic
we got like 1% done

in game
or a reinterpret cast
is ToFamiliar a cast
or, a better question
or does it have to be an entity of type 3
does ToFamiliar work on all entities
hmmm
ing?
time to lilith and azazelify him
yay he is ing
it seems to crash ¯\_(?)_/¯
with characters
you should be able to just put an empty itempools.xml in resources then your own items in content's itempools.xml
for example, if you want to empty item pools
uu noice
o h
because if you put it in `resources` it just replaces the game files, but `content` is handled specially
did you put players.xml in `resources` or `content`?
omg my mod is so good that it crashed the game ?
it's 0 bytes
the submission has no files
<@!267112861921181697> u wot
lets see the fancyness of Michael
no need for the anim2 file
what
skin is the file with anims
I get it now
oooooooooo
and no matter how bad the dlc is, that's a really cunt move.
it isn't compatiable because its a rebirth mod imo
this http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834365454
What isn't removed?
man luamerger is a livesaver
mhm
I like how it's not removed, it's just "incompatible"
Butt
Robo Baby
and it is kinda workable
well this "example character" isnt that bad
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834365454 I found this though
I can't find anything hmmm
does it work?
there is one example mod
sigh...
which aint char mods
there are tons of char mods
which one
just download an new one from workshop
and the anm2 is in costumes itself
can some1 give me the example player char mod?
wheres the amm.2
np
sorry about shitty grammar
So
its not hide and seek time
I am learning French rn and my grammar is getting fucked
why are you invisible Michael
whyyy
fuck
sigh
don't you need to put the fiules there.
fixed that
nvm
\o/
yay my char doesnt even appear in the menu
they are located in gfx/costumes
thank
copy isaac chars sprite sheet and the 0.000.player.anm2 files
<@146600389779783680> what files should I copy for me to start spriting?
I guess I could make it shorter...
without going outside of the boundries of the spriteart?
but how will I attach his beard?
Michael took way longer, mostly because of his freaky wings
kinda
kek
so basically I need to resprite Isaac but with a beard
yeah, AddCacheFlags
http://i.imgur.com/yGNxiS6.png
pretty sure it's AddCacheFlags on EntityPlayer
what does Abraham look like
bullshitting
update_cache?>
I just don't know where
there is a method to do that
give an item that does nothing imo
no
giveitem and remove it right away?
oh
through code
I know some caches are triggered on item pickup
how do you cause a cache eval?
it can have a special Scapegoat that's reskinned to look like Isaac heh
or i'll call the cops
give us now
give us isaac editor limt
I do a dum
is that how you spell it
dunno
So why cant we play as Abraham?
We can play as Isaac, right?
hmmm
j o e y
I feel blind cant find that mod
seinfeld?
hmm what about
so I'm just gonna rewrite it
the mod is called that
I think it's too late at this point to separate my mod into multiple scripts with luamerger
I need a character that ascents
a k a e v e r y o n e
is there any important bible characters that ascend into heaven
uu
not edits
adds
I honeslty never thought I would go on a bible website unironically
that adds two characters
on the workshop
there is an example mod
did any mod like add a char instead of redo 1?
FireTear works on linux!
wooooo
I heard that custom characters can be actually implemented properly now, that curses can be added and item pools work
what changed?
hey, been a few days since I last modded
cuz I still have no idea how to connect anims with code
now to the hard part, how do I connect you my anim file with my char code
but I dont wanna make it now
well there is 1 more thing missing on him
but thats how the angels look like
Its so werid to see no mouth or eyes
thanks michael
You get a Michael Thumbs up
xD
unsaac
negative isaac?
lol
https://gfycat.com/IllegalCourageousEgret
which will make him a bit hard to play
h o r r a y
time to learn about angels
and I have an amazing idea to him
As a character at least
wow I'm gonna tell jesus you said that
and since gabriel is used (:c) I found Michael
Plus Jesus is a little too big for Isaac
I will add an angel
in the game, so I decided
imo
maybe even more
jesus is overused
4 evil chars
like
we got
Well, I got the feeling that well
jesus
uh
Which biblical figure is resurrected and somewhat important?*
grammar
the grammer
oh god
I don't read the bible, so whos a biblical character that is resurrected? Other than lazarus
what's your best character idea?
name*
or my nae
well, my mod is called Ascension
I got Michael atm
Yes! I have had so many fucking ideas, but all for characters.
(yes)
check the workshop
Are charcter portraits working yet?
Hey everyone
Im almost done with my char sprite sheet :3
maybe
will that make them totally incompatible with each other or will they just not let me re-enable achieves?
turns out almost all of those mods have content folders
does someone know whats the difference between Sprite:Play and Sprite:PlayOverlay?
where are all the features
I have a question
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/820061495388028928
but It doesn't say how to make multiple resource things work together
it specifically says so in the guide
I know how to make multiple lua mods work together
rip me
nvm the up there
oh
oh
sauge
~~Wall of Flesh ?~~
who is wof?
because I thought this would be an issue
to clarify, I haven't done any steps of wof's guide other than running the extractor
unless combining callbacks is really easy
what mods would I need to drop to make them all work together
so basically I can't make them work together?
I don't think I know how to do that
:/
you'd probably have to manually combine the callbacks
these are the mods I'm trying to make work
large gif so mobile users beware
http://i.imgur.com/mpdMkR7.gifv
hey, I'm following wof's guide for re-enablign achievements with mods
how do you apply it to multiple mods
won't they conflict?
or did they make the files in ab+ more seperated so that two mods that modify remotely the same thing aren't incompatible anymore?

(reasking this here because it seemed more appropriate)
Wake me up when good community tools are out
I just can't bring myself into modding again
just limt, limting around
cool
limt made it
Is that a official tool or
I didn't draw it ?
the floor just looks wrong
also the bedroom tileset looks real dumb in a 2x2 room lol
super issac editor
just limt limting around as usual

<@229593818691928067> spear of destiny has id 1000
can i just copy mom's knife and change the id to 3
wait nvm
why does it need id 3

that's familiars
but it just needs to have an id="3"
find a familiar in there that would be similar to yours and copy/paste to have a smiliar hitbox
I haven't done much with entities but I assume familiars are defined as familiar variants in entities2.xml
it's in entities2.xml
...I think
whats the familiar one then
ah
baby.xml is the co-op babies
is that baby.xml
whats the familiar xml
um
yeah but not to confuse with the item id ^^
which is the same as the familiar ID
Yeah, it takes a FamiliarVariant
time to make microwave pizza and contemplate suicide
[insert idubbbz meme]
i would advise against it
im gonna stab my testicles now
MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE take the Entity variant though
I want to die
I had an entities2.xml file that I wasn't even using
I feel even more retarded than ever
I found the issue
The familiar id is for MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE and stuff
I know
<@124088844181045249> if you use ids it will conflict with other mods
Fuck, should have known
do i need both the item AND the familiar data?
You can add them by name?
Wait
oh okay
no
passive*
should i change GetItemIDByName to GetFamiliarIdByName
the item was previously a passie

use Name instead of Id
Yeah, you can add them to item pool by name
alright
yes ```<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="treasure">
        <Item DecreaseBy="1" Name="Marshmallow" RemoveOn="0.1" Weight="2" />
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>```
also, can i add custom items to item pools if i don't give them any particular ids
Didn't you name it `entityPlayer`, not `player`?
then every update you set the familiar to a fixed distance to isaac, at the current angle
when isaac shoots in one direction you change the desired angle
[INFO] - [Magic Pen] Error in PostUpdate call: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/magic pen/main.lua:17: attempt to index a nil value (global 'player')
every update you make the current angle slowly go towards the desired angle
you would keep a variable for the current angle and one for the desired angle
oh well it's not too hard
i know how to make a new familiar but what do i do with lua to make it happen
sorry, i'm new to lua
anyways, jean, how would i do that?
err, I think this belongs in <#207259602969034753>
it's because you shitpost so much
the issue here is the items are entirely useless
I has the most itemz
ha
You have found **4** item(s).
!items
Robo bitch
why does the bot pm me and tell the items in the channel here as well what
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
!items
why did i say everyone gets melee tears i meant melee weapons
<@213795824507944960> use the game's framecount
except for cain
how does one add a delay to a loop
everyone gets meele tears
well i do not know how to make isaac not shoot tears
i made it so none of the characters can shoot tears in the mod
no
does isaac still shoot tears with your item ?
<@166249905772429312> you can do this with a familiar
THIS IS A FUCKING BACKUP YOU C U N T
but I KNOW that this backup works
MAKE A BACKUP1!@!@@#@!#!@
ender try removing items one by one and find the one that dosent crash when you start
You have found **4** item(s).
!items
I found caffiene
mom's knife has it's own independent direction from isaac
it has a different sprite in that challenge
h e l p m e I a m d e s p e r a t e
spear of destiny
what item is in the Guardian challenge then ?
no it's direction changes with isaacs direction
doesn't the spear do that ?
i wanted to make an item similar to that but it has a bigger range and can holding an attack key makes it rotate in that direction
even my backup, which I KNOW works, doesn't work
nopw
no it's a passive item
in the games files does stuff like spear of destiny count as a familiar
Is there a way to set the DamageCooldown of the character when taking damages with MC_USE_ITEM but canceling them ?  I means, I want to cancel damage and code my own behavior for the TAKE_DMG but if I cancel the damages, the character doesn't enter in invicibility frames mode
<@166249905772429312> sure, make it a familiar
no shit imo
I have a backup
wait
<@213795824507944960> maybe .Timeout ?
it was last night Jean, I wont remember shit
does anyone know how to make melee weapons yet
<@110125570452398080> Nope didnt work
well use your "brain" ctrl-z to undo
Did you check the log.txt?
I went to check my code after it crashed
I loaded a saved
I cant
good idea!!
woag!
<@190495109748359168> CTRL+Z until it doesn't crash anymore and figure what you did wrong
Looks like it
https://hastebin.com/uzumulevex.lua
help
can someone like
Ill try but is that right?
Does it work? I actually haven't tested it yet
<@110125570452398080> 
```if pennumber == 0 then --White Creep
local creep = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_WHITE, 3, entityPlayer.Position, Vector(0, 0), entityPlayer)
local creep_effect = creep:ToEffect()
creep_effect.LifeSpan = 900```
is this how we communicate now
noger
lol
why does N auto delete
Hey ! Is there a way to set the DamageCooldown of the character when taking damages with MC_USE_ITEM but canceling them ?  I means, I want to cancel damage and code my own behavior for the TAKE_DMG but if I cancel the damages, the character doesn't enter in invicibility frames mode
<@195368190333812736>
```Lua
-- Some psuedocode
local creep = Isaac.spawn(--[[Whatever here, I think you got this part down]])
local creep_effect = creep:ToEffect() -- Spawn function returns an Entity. An EntityEffect is needed to change the lifespan of creep
creep_effect.LifeSpan = 900 -- 900 ticks, 30 seconds
-- LifeSpan is documented here: https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_entity_effect.html
```
just make a backup ender
of the deleting mod
its a spooky ghost story
oh
that's not really comforting
and its not in the recycle bin
because my mod randomly deleted
well i cant really look back on my code
go go gadget retard
I am retard
see
thats what happened to me
lol
well
How would a typo cause a fucking runtime error?
Oh, you want the creep itself to stay there for 30 seconds
typos can ruin everything
that was my case
its probably a typo
why cant I find the error then
but
>:(
no you arent
im retarded
but
then manually fix it?
Wait so does anyone know how to make the creep last for 30 seconds?
https://hastebin.com/ubozepedek.lua
I'm retarded
my script was smaller than yours so
but
make a debugger
the error was in my script
well what i did was
and I verified cache and nothing helped
what are some fixes for runtime errors? I have no debuggers...
ANYWAY
the most obvious virus site my go
I had to delete my search history so I wouldn't accidentally go to hastbin.com not hastebin
Hey ! Is there a way to set the DamageCooldown of the character when taking damages with MC_USE_ITEM but canceling them ?  I means, I want to cancel damage and code my own behavior for the TAKE_DMG but if I cancel the damages, the character doesn't enter in invicibility frames mode
whats wrong daddy https://hastebin.com/uzumulevex.lua
White creep*
<3
thanksssss
Here you all go COMMENTS
https://hastebin.com/ubozepedek.lua
stupid
a
is
ALEX
robonig- no that's too far
robo bitch
I make comments after I make the code
robobaby? more like robocunt
wtf robo baby
why do i have enigma bombs
how do I even debug is there is literally nothing to debug?
and comments are always nessasary
wait
but hes assigning timer with a bool and a number or a number
theres a website that teached lua in like 15 min
<@195368190333812736> Maybe you should consider looking at some basic lua programming tutorials? I imagine that it would help you out a lot!
comments should rarely be necessary if variables are named well
just like try to debug it
nooo
really b a d?
your code is messed up
even without comments
honestly I can pretty easily tell whats going on here
oh i had that once <@!267112861921181697>
if he has the trinket it decrements the timer, otherwise it resets it to 900
how do you fix a runtime error? I dunno where to put this honeslty
Ahh
:(
lack of commenting
How so?
For every 30 seconds it rolls a number and then it spawns a creep behind you
its ugly like me
yeah this code isnt beautiful
Its the timer
what are yo trying todo there?
```timer = has_trinket and (timer - 1) or 900```
some commenting on that would be nice
i dont know how do add delays
but as i said
so you could make creep every 5 frames
but that might lag
well you can make it a creep pool every frame
This is my code:
https://hastebin.com/ozakaxukuh.lua
hmm
well
Crap how do I make that creep just soawn behind me for 30 seconds?
it would probably lagg abit
all at once
Or all at once?
i dont know how to add a delay though ;(
would it do it overtime?
that will just spawn creep 900 times
I want it to run for 30 seconds
```if number == 0 then
    for i = 1, 900 do 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_WHITE, 3, entityPlayer.Position, Vector(0, 0), entityPlayer)```
yes unless you add a delay
Does it run 1 loop every frame?
well it would run pretty much instantly
Can anyone make a new character now
Okay so how fast will this run? say if I wanted it to run for 30 seconds?
i haven't been active since a while because i wanted to wait if people found anything new
where it exit the loop
ok so i is just a variable, and the loop will add 1 to i every time it runs, until it reaches 10
so can you break this down for me so I understand it? 1. What does 'i' mean and what is 1, 10
```for i = 1, 10 do ```
like make a loop?
How does one loop something over?
can someone help me please?! https://redd.it/5nsnyp
can someone give me an example of its usage
it's still returning -1
oh I see what you mean
even breaks the limit if you want
work well for now
then set that variable to false
You know what you can do with fire delay? Set a variable in the evaluate cache and apply the change somewhere else in the code
<@126590786945941504> what
MaxFire Delay isn't bugged !
You did define it in the xml, right?
GetCostumeIdByPath is always returning -1 for me, even if the file exists
balls
Ugh
It still does, yeah
Is MaxFireDelay still bugged so that tear rate can't be changed?
one that I did not edit
Do you have any mod folders?
kill m e p  l  e  a  s  e
Okay, thanks!
never looked there
it was under functions in modules
oooh

pls help I a m d y I n g

YOu don't even want `lua` as syntax there
lol
Random is a global
I'll try again though, I guess
So I didn't bother
but I had problems
I also tried using the RNG class
Where is Random()?
doesn't work
Isn't that seeded?
Why not use `Random()`?
I'll just use the game frames as a seed then
But that's just for local debugging
hherp
Fair
You can get require with `--luadebug`
<@124088844181045249> You can't, for a reason - it's abusable
h e l p m e
Keep getting that require and os both are nil values
Okay, does anyone know how I can require the os library in my mod?
I got a runtime error and I didn't even add anything
Guys help
its the internet
cant tell
is that sarcasm
yeah they work well ?
if for some reason you didn't hear
the itempools are fixed
Oh guys
for some retarded reason I thought it had an a in it
Thanks

to be fair the last time i tried was several patches ago
hm ok, good to know
But I never really got the information to confirm anything

erm
atleast none i found out
just for future reference

Is it possible to make new floors yet
Hey
Hi !
holy gays
hoy hays
guys
fuck
hey huys
If you really want to... ¯\_(?)_/¯
Maybe if we retweet it enough he will see :p
Perhaps I'll luck out and get an answer **or** support
Except I tagged it with <#264851654627688450>Mods, so it's probably gonna be seen by someone else ¯\_(?)_/¯
I decided to go asshole and tweeted tyrone
Yes of course
Nope, but it should be easy if we get access to Config ¯\_(?)_/¯
<@126590786945941504> So I suppose you don't know how to get an instance of Costume either ?
its annoying haveing to test these things ourselfs, especially considering i dont have ZeroBrane
but the Bool mentioned in the function, i cant find in attribues for items
But luckily, we have logging capabilities, so if we make a mistake, we can easily find out what it is
I haven't had to use it yet, so I don't know what **exactly** it is
ItemState **is** an enum
thats my point, ItemState is mentioned once in AddCosutme function and then is just used in enum
¯\_(?)_/¯
hmm, so Item state is after the item is activated but before the effect is executed?
Below the short packed list
A lot of them only have the info shown in the detailed list
98% of those are self-explanatory
there are just so many functions and attributes that have no information with them, its frustrating
I mean, please clarify, I'm not sure if it's sarcasm or ignorance
...what
if only we had a full set of documentation along with the class list -.-
But no idea how to get an instance of Config
I found out that this is where the functions exist
`ItemConfig.Config.__class.GetCollectibles()`
BTW
anyone know what the ItemStateOnly bool is in the AddCostume function?
is there an easy way to upgrade a mod from AB to AB+
in animation editor
<@267673192372371467> How are you playing the animation?
Something like that
let's say yes <@229593818691928067>
you mean drop after a room is cleared ?
There's currently no way to make a custom pickup/trinket spawn in the game, right?
I have a little problem, I created an animation, but it won´t play
And sounds possible, the only problem being, you'll either have clunky controls or no challenge
That'd be interesting
i got the idea from the thing melon aka limt posted with the bouncy tear
you play pinball with a p big tear and use it to kill enemies
ISAAC PINBALL
BUT
I JUST HAD A IDEA I DONT KNOW IF ITS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IM AN ABSOLUTE NOOB TO CODING
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE
so I use a for loop and try and catch when it exceeds the number of entities?
and I cannot find anything else
there is this method GetGridEntity (integer Index)
are you asking yourself??
What's the point of arguing
nicalis also doesn't have a good record for improving the things they release afterward
But anyway
I'm not talking about whether it's official or has potential, I'm just saying it's not very powerful
ok
'Stink Eye' was rather clever, if you'd ask me
just random item name
i know
Rot has nothing to do with poop
maybe rotten eye?
The thing is that it's the official API. That doesn't mean it will be better, and it also currently isn't, but it might be a lot more powerful in the future. Also, that's where all the people are, so more people can enjoy your mod.
ok
<@223869207748542464>  Some-one else said 'Stink Eye' when I showed the poopshot eye item sprite
api is very underwhelming, even besides the no documentation
I mean I'm sure people can do cool things with it and there's no reason not to have fun with it if you want but
isaac has mouse input ya dummy
yet? never
does api even have mouse input yet?
i know
Also, as for the last one, there was the axe item somebody made
or maybe yes, but it will be ULTRA HARD
~~make the endless stairs from mario 64~~
I really don't get why you keep beefing about the apis
no
????

no <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
and knockback very big
api can do this I assume
https://gfycat.com/DisloyalGoodnaturedAfricanporcupine
u can make damage 0
yes
it's my own project
whats the red dead bird? also what the hell did that, limt? antibirth api?
can api do this?
https://gfycat.com/OrneryAppropriateBalloonfish
ye that's very shit
only integer values
no
uh
I'm more interested if knowing if you can set tear delay to .5
just changing the velocity a bit
Yeah, not hard at all in ab+, honestly
CHALLANGE ACCEPTED!
ok
go ahead
we can do this with ab+ api too
https://gfycat.com/DeafeningAdmirableFinwhale
give yourself all the wire coat hangers you want, your maxteardelay won't ever fall below 5
guys, how about name rotten eye?
the effects of the two are different
there are items that manually lower the fire delay, and those that are just tears down
I had a run few days ago with 3
tear fire rate has no cap at 5
Noice!
i will give you credit in my mod
oh, thx!
Poopshot
Yep
for me?
lol
<@223869207748542464>
I have an item that reduces MaxFireDelay by 5
so normally Tears Up items have a cap at 5, so you have to check that manually, and the other thing is that changing MaxFireDelay manually breaks that cap
How is MaxFireDelay broken?
it is working
is there any way to make tearrate changing items other then changing `MaxFireDelay` which is broken in practice
is to erase it, in order to clear bkg
does AddEntityFlag let you add your own flag or just the ones already in the gamw?
if u want to say it, say it!
maybe
guys do you know where is that filter/ overlay?

ok
xDDDD
u need to copy default tear from the isaacs entities2.xml to entities2.xml in ur mod
lol that meme https://68.media.tumblr.com/e82d423cd45fe76784944431b01248f1/tumblr_ojpswlhRmM1ti0jvjo1_540.jpg
ok
yes ?
so, do u want to know how to make custom tear variant?
idk dude
oh
just there is a poop entity and gridentity
and the last time I looked I couldn't find any function that looked like they would work for that
100%
yes!
so poop probably will be a gridentity
hm okay
I didn't worked with rooms yet
same
xD
idk how to do that
so, you need to check every space of the room
np
sorry for my bad english
I didn't understand what you wanted to say before
lol
and again do you know how to check for poop in a room ?
yes
hm ok so it works?
why?
well i need change this sprite for a new item >.>

EatMeReturns - heute um 17:21 Uhr
sure
but you won't like where they lead
because there's no Entity:ToTear()
so you can't call ChangeVariant() on pre-existing tears```
I thought it's not possible
look
yes
not replacement
so you could shoot normal and this?
variant
no, custom tear
?
so just replacement no variant
that is using default anm2 files from game
made a custom tear
how
you shoot poop
lol
that's my favorite function
yes?
yes
how to check is there any poops in the room?
what do you mean
and look at this xddd

good search function is disabled here
some found it out ?
uhm I read it a few days ago
How does one make isaac animate holding up their item like Notched Axe?
I'll be back later.
Oh
and then your code and then \```
if you do \```lua
how come you code has color in discord?
you may have to restart the sprite or something
ok
Ive already done that and yes it does show
and if you can't find it in the log.txt, your code is never reaching that point.
and search for asdfmemes
and open up your log.txt
run the game with that
```lua
  if player:HasCollectible(thefirstbornson) then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for _,e in pairs(entities) do
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and
        e.Variant == 0 then
        local sprite = e:GetSprite()
        sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet(0, 'gfx/cupids_arrow_tears.png')
        Isaac.DebugString("asdfmemes")
      end
    end
  end
```
seems so dumb
why tho
oh fuck
I don't see any addluck in it.
<@116386733905412105> yes its gatting to the end of the code
that comment is in the unpacked challenges.xml

adddamage works
i mean
so i'm assuming...
ik but addluck works
thx
I don't see any other challenges with addluck
<@182519885669072906> one sec, reviewing your code
you can do a Isaac.DebugString("asdf") to print to the log.txt
are you sure your code ever gets to that section?
Why adddamage works but addluck doesn't
the sprites not changing
then how is it not working
its not erroring
what does your log say
```
  if player:HasCollectible(thefirstbornson) then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for _,e in pairs(entities) do
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and
        e.Variant == 0 then
        local sprite = e:GetSprite()
        sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet(0, 'gfx/cupids_arrow_tears.png')
      end
    end
  end
``` 
so i cant figure out why this wont work
Why adddamage works and not htis ?
this*
so I guess I'll wait xD
lol
so you can't call ChangeVariant() on pre-existing tears
because there's no Entity:ToTear()
but you won't like where they lead
sure
any tips where I can look when I want to add a tear variant?
kill wasn't the right one. let's try remove
...
or Remove()
Ok I'll try that. That's a good idea
with kill command
that's what I'd try
kill the creep
is it possible to increase a stat on item pickup in challenges ?
I got it to show up in the game but it won't dissipate until I leave the room
anybody tried making custom creep?
```function myMod:rangeTransformation(oValue, oRangeStart, oRangeEnd, eRangeStart, eRangeEnd)
    return (oValue - oRangeStart)*(eRangeEnd-eRangeStart)/(oRangeEnd-oRangeStart)+eRangeStart
end

function myMod:colorValueTransformation(colorValue)
    return myMod:rangeTransformation(colorValue, 0, 255, 0, 1)
end```
If you really need
Just make a transformation function
It's the actual new standard, I'd say
Easier to code I would guess
Not 0 and 255
tf why
The values are between 0 and 1
yes I do but 10 and 255 dont change anything
*do you even RGBA*
*dude*
how do I get a color to be darker with Color()?
BTW, anybody would want to sprite for a bigger (shitty) mod project?
sure
i see OwO what kind of stuff does it have? wanna possibly contact me privately with details?
<@195237099316707328> I have 2 pretty much complete items code wise but no gfx for them
and yeah indeed XD
i was the one ?
I mean more guys who make sprites and animations are never bad <@195237099316707328> ?
who was the guy who could help with spriting earlier?
lol
someone created if for me, but my game just crashes
I mean I even failed to add a costume ?
i could help with animations ? (visually at least)
I'm too lazy to learn to make familars and animation.. FeelsBadMan any ideas where I could start xD <@229593818691928067>
tear*
Im just trying to add the cupids arrow sheet to my teer
<@120355885615808512> thanks !
its one of the games built in sheets
is your spritesheet png 32-bit?
<@229593818691928067> nice mod man ^^
how do get the color to show?
Sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet(LayerId, PngFilename)
```
  if player:HasCollectible(thefirstbornson) then
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for _,e in pairs(entities) do
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and
        e.Variant == 0 then
        local sprite = e:GetSprite()
        sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet(0, 'gfx/cupids_arrow_tears.png')
      end
    end
  end
end
```
to replacing the spritesheet
except change the loading of the .anm2
```lua
        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                --local entityTear = entities[i]:ToTear()

                if entities[i].Variant == 0 then
                    entities[i].Variant = 33
                    --entities[i]:ChangeVariant(33)
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
                    local anim = "RegularTear" .. math.min(math.max(math.floor(entities[i].CollisionDamage), 1), 13)
                    sprite:Play(anim, true)
                    -- DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH WUBWUB WORM
                end
            end
        end
```
example*
sure
anyone got a good examp of tear spritesheet change?
LevelCurse yeah they're bitwise
have you looked for an enum in the docs
idk
aren't they bitwise or something
what the actual fuck
when i type 3, 4 and 7 it only gives me curse of darkness
but these are wrong
yes
curse of the cursed XD
thx
```<curses>
    <curse id="1" name="Curse of Darkness" />
    <curse id="2" name="Curse of the Labyrinth" />
    <curse id="3" name="Curse of the Lost" />
    <curse id="4" name="Curse of the Unknown" />
    <curse id="5" name="Curse of the Cursed" />
    <curse id="6" name="Curse of the Maze" />
    <curse id="7" name="Curse of the Blind" />
</curses>
```
are they in the itempool thing? there was something about curse
I can't find the curses ids for challenges
that would be a cool effect, visually
i see
or maybe it could be that all tiers toy shoot would be two tears (blue and red tiers) over lapping and (kinda how 3d movies where just two overlapping images)
i think that would make it so one eye shoots red tiers (more damage) and the other one blue (some other effect)
and what about the 3d glasses ?
for maybe until you used the item again
like the idea i had was that you split into two, and both sides act like abel
well not really, just a different abel type of effect
so a better Abel ?
i'd go with isaac being split in two as its what loki does
well that is kinda uninspired :I
maybe Loki's zipper is an active that gives you double shot for a room ?
there's already too many fart items :p
or maybe some monstro's organ bloted with gass XD
that's pretty good
Yeah, like a Pogo Stick or something.
i like that idea
well that in itself would be a cool idea for an itemm but maybe with a different theme
But yeah, not very realstic for a *small* spring.
Maybe if it had a longer charge and did that rock explosion thing when he lands.
i'd like to keep the theme of it being a small spring, so little jumps
yeah
Seems like it'd just be a better version of How To Jump.
so you can get out of trouble
i'd think of something more fitting for an effect like that
what if it makes you jump when you get hit ? ?
yeah
but then i would need to be an active
and land wherever you want
what if you can jump into the air, off-screen like monstro
latter for rocks XD
and yes
tho maybe it should be a passive instead of a trinket
So effectively a ladder, but for rocks.
well my idea was that it is a trinket that allows you to hop onto rocks and hop off. (but not over gaps to not make ladder useless)
<@195237099316707328> what's the Small spring ?
what i'd really like to add to the game is some other religious symbolism (as i kinda find that fitting) but my ideas are like wayyy tooo complex
yeah i kinda realized that after the fact XD
Nice layout. Poison Kisses and The Virus overlap though, don't they?
but thats only an idea
yes. i think it would make you into a kinda of double abel (where your two parts would be mirroring the movement of each other). the parts would shoot towards the center (i think it would work as a spacebar item)
i didnt expect myself to be playing jacob and esau when i have that
Does Loki's zipper split you in two?
thank you ?
Look nice  <@195237099316707328>
i havent done much in the way of enemies, but i could if someone needed then (and had a good idea)
if someone wants to use them, i can provide then in separate files
theres some ideas that i've made ?
http://toyraple.deviantart.com/art/Binding-of-isaac-Rebirth-Ideas-656846077
you're right
in that case, something not unlikely to exist
oh guess I missed that somehow
well i have some already if you'd like me to link then to you (tho they are not in separate pics)
and I'll make it do something
sprite something
hi there (i'm new here dont bite) i'm a nood to modding (and novice at best with coding). i feel like i'm good at making sprites (specially for this game) so if someone would like  help with their mod in the graphical department, i'll dladly do ?
http://i.imgur.com/KADrO4r.png
although it just also might be in the c++
if you look at the base game xml it only really has fields for "passive" and "active" as categories, not "familiar", "cat", "bombs", etc
this gives me hope - http://i.imgur.com/e6Wdffr.png
transformations
see: Dead Sea Scrolls
a lot of things like that seem to be hard coded
I'm.... not 100% sure that even the game has that in c++
I'll wait until API gets updated so that we can query item data instead of having to just hardcode list of all the familiar items
I wanted to implement an item that allows you to cheat death by consuming one of your familiars instead of dying when taking lethal damage
Just do a loop through the ids of 1-510
Is there at least a way to get a table with all collected items
3 familiars following isaac!
3, ah hah hah
2, ah hah hah
1, ah hah hah
you know you're not being funny, right?
use your fingers
yknow
"count 'em" meaning what
but whatever
it might be a bit hard with box of friends
count 'em
is there a way to get number of familiars you have
No, okay, I give up
what
I try entity.target = any
But not work.
Really, I don't know if **anybody** knows how to do it yet, not sure if anybody tries, but that's what the docs are for
Entity.Target, for example?
Have you tried, y'know
smh
Any know how to change the target of supertrollbombs? or how to add the correct velocity to this?
Why not ask them?
.....i really wonder when will the creator of the heavenly angels mod make it working with afterbirth+ because right now its only working with afterbirth
Ok thanks!
Yeah check the docs for EntityPlayer, forgot the exact name
Yeah I want to disable player input is there a way to do that ?
Disable player input and change velocity? ¯\_(?)_/¯
Another question: I play a jump animation on Isaac to jump over a pit, and I was wondering if i can prevent the user from trying to move Isaac midair because with my function that move Isaac, it looks like Isaac is shaking ?
Oh thanks !
In which case `AnimateCollectible`
Unless you want the player to hold it for a while or play it in other times
Then the animation plays
`return true`
dude
Hi! For a custom active item, I have to manually play the UseItem animation and the sound effect (if there is one) when the item is used, but the item is not appearing in Isaac's hands. Does someone know how to do it ?
its not forced or anything i swear
(
still 2 ppl
you just dont get it
no guys the meme is *really* funny
pshh
*sigh*
Pretty much
A shitty <#207235517236903937> spam meme?
The angel/devil stuff on this discord server
...oh
What petition? :o
hows the petition going? xD
What angles?
So they'll cover all enemies you try to shoot
D:
Still no angles <@109624258317033472> <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
Basically, supposedly they're faster than the damn flies
People complained
doesnt make sense to me. But whatever ^^
Good question
but why nerf stonefatties? they didnt even do damge oO
mkay
misc gameplay bugs fixed
#NERFFORNUBZ
ShockwaveParams added
stone fatties get tired
nah
new isaac update? anything cool new?
Hi dude!
Good morning everyone ^^
Or it could be that they implemented a proper way to do it but either didn't document it or we didn't realise
Or could be that they have managed to not notice it missing
Could be that tears are handled in another way
I'm asking what is difficult about implementing it on their end
I know what it's for
right
That kinda stuff
Height, flags
Which means, you konw
You can't edit tear-specific properties if you get an Entity and not an EntityTear without ToTear
Basically
also what's difficult about ToTear()
oh
like the circle of rocks from big impacts rite
Shockwave?
Also, they did add ShockwaveParams in this update
so ?
i mean antibirth
but i think you mean ? instead of ab-
modding tools for me
is just
ab+
ab-
?
dont you mean
ab- was free, and it was a better content expansion

After all, AB+ isn't just mod tools
They're mostly an annoyance and have flaws that people pointed out, especially in greed mode
And nerfing stone fatties is probably good
Honestly, the last update was yesterday
Yeah why dont they release a major update every few days
this is not what we want
like nerf stone fatties and update documentation a little bit
wtf are nicalis are doing
Oh
still no ToTear()
nice!
a bunch of the documentation files got updated tho
https://redd.it/5np6oo
um apparently BoI patched again a couple hours ago
hi
hi
heya
hey
hi ?
okay
inside of your timer's trigger, you just randomize pennumb and reset the timer
and you put that outside of your timer's trigger, inside of update
with the chained up if statements
so you take your spawn code
uh
I tried if pennumb == 0 and timer >=1 then but it doesn't seem to work
<@116386733905412105> Do you know how I can make the creep run the whole time until 30 more seconds passes then it chooses a new creep to run?
yeah
@here ```<=```
that means equal to or less than right?
I guess thats the best thing to do
Ill test it
```timer = has_trinket and (timer - 1) or 900
    if timer <= 0 then
    timer = 900
    local pennumb = math.random(0, 2)```
Should that work?
Used to GMC
= is the set value function
nah
oh thought you had to use set
instead of set timer 900
timer = 900
```if timer <= 0 then
set timer 900```
?
Hmm
Im bad at this...
the same way you set any other variable?
How do I do something like set timer 900?
Sorry, how?
set it back to 900
inside of the timer's final trigger
<@116386733905412105> How do I reset the timer?
What do you think the trinket is suppost to put a random trail under the player but it seems like ALOT for just a trinket
?
don't give up! trust your instincts!
yeah maybe Ill rethink the trinket its seems like alot
because 30 creep/second could be a lot
you might want a second timer
and then outside of your timer, on update, spawn your creep
and reset the timer
only randomize pennumb or whatever
at the end of 30 seconds
Oh no I dont how do I reset the timer but make the trail stay there?
I thought?
inside of your if timer <= 0
do you ever set timer back to 900
uh
not just 1 and then changing every 30 seconds
But yeah its just spamming all the colors
haha
the not-squiggly
Ops
lol tildes are the top-left of your keyboard
Nope
``` timer = has_trinket and (timer - 1) or 900
    if timer <= 0 then
    local pennumb = math.random(0, 2)
    if pennumb == 0 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_WHITE, 3, entityPlayer.Position, Vector(0, 0), entityPlayer)
    elseif pennumb == 1 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_RED, 3, entityPlayer.Position, Vector(0, 0), entityPlayer)
    elseif pennumb == 2 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_BLACK, 3, entityPlayer.Position, Vector(0, 0), entityPlayer)
    end```
you can wrap code in 3 tildes to make it formatted as code
can you just link the section of the code?
Do you know how to make it only pick the trail if it chooses the number becuase right now its just spamming all the trails all together...
https://hastebin.com/qatavixixa.lua
nvm ive found it
anyone know how items are given a costume file?
Yeah! Got it working. Now to get the tears shooting super fast like soy milk
That too
ins't it AddCallback too?
It's `ModCallbacks`
Alrighty. Now the only issue is with my Modcallbacks

[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/op soy milk/main.lua:14: attempt to index a nil value (global 'Modcallbacks')

OPSoyMilk:Addcallback(Modcallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, OPSoyMilk.CacheUpdate)
New mod is out! https://redd.it/5nps6y
cache="damage firedelay"
assumeing its only damage you're altering
```passive cache="damage"``` should be ok
uh one sec
<passive cache="damage" so along this line in my items.xml near damage what should be there? It did read  <passive cache="damage tears"
how dose AddCostume work?
cache flags
tears isn't valid in your items.xml
I'm playing a game on my other screen
now you're missing an end
As a noob to this I just don't have a clue. So don't be too rough with me lol.
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/op soy milk/main.lua:14: 'end' expected (to close 'function' at line 4) near <eof>

so you had too many ends probably

idk try it again and see if there is a new error or the same

<@116386733905412105> Do you know how to make it only pick the trail if it chooses the number becuase right now its just spamming all the trails all together...
https://hastebin.com/qatavixixa.lua
Let me run the game real fast
since it multiplies stuff by 10 to look cool
spidermod would read 50 damage as 500
50 damage is a lot of damage
they generally tell you what line the errors are on
what are the errors?
Alright. So change firedelay to maxfiredelay and when it comes to my number values for damage what should I change them to? I want it to be stupidly overpowered of course. Also would this fix my issue with the mod not loading? There's apparently 3 or so errors in the code
that will put it in to the negatives in almost all cases
for the firedelay
50 is entirely too high
maxfiredelay is the actual tear stat
firedelay is current attack cooldown
Also I guessed the tear rate since well...Idk what I'm doing.
Longest ten minutes of my life lol. I also need some help with my lua coding (new as all hell to it). So I'm trying to make a little joke item that takes soy milk and makes it completely broken (lots of damage with the same tear rate)

This is my code (I was going off a tutorial and he had issues, but he fixed them. I don't know what I'm having to fix). 

local OPSoyMilk = RegisterMod("BrokenSoyMilk",1)
local BrokenSoyMilk = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Broken Soy Milk")

function OPSoyMilk:CacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(BrokenSoyMilk) then
    player.Damage = player.Damage + 50;
  end
  if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY then
    player.FireDelay = player.FireDelay - 50;
  end
end
end

OPSoyMilk:Addcallback(Modcallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, OPSoyMilk.CacheUpdate)
Ahh!
at some point you're referencing the variable "player" on line 23.
So what do I do? I dont see what else to do. Ive used
    local entityPlayer = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
No?
but did you ever define a variable named player?
you defined entityPlayer
[Hermit Cab]:Shops no longer require keys
Yeah but its saying it got NIL but I have defind the player right?
your issue was entityPlayer was undefined right
well the last time you had this error
or simmliar
Do I need something? like define the player?
its got 15, 17, 19, 21! Heres the code:
https://hastebin.com/vodixawaqo.lua
so go to line 23
[INFO] - [Magic Pen] Error in PostUpdate call: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/magic pen/main.lua:23: attempt to index a nil value (global 'player')
Because you named your variable this name before.
oh yeah
the line right above?
remember how you declared my_trinket the variable
wow
Literally `my_trinket`
srs?
or just my_trinket
No.
has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasTrinket(Magic Pen)
So no ""
```has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasTrinket(my_trinket)```
[INFO] - [Magic Pen] Error in PostUpdate call: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/magic pen/main.lua:9: bad argument #1 to 'HasTrinket' (number expected, got string)
La Saga
ahh okay
local entityPlayer = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
you gotta define entity player
from my example code
What do you mean?
And where did you get entityPlayer?
Well that spams my log when I do    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasTrinket("Magic Pen") but when I dont use "" it just gives me 1 error
which is nil
you're trying to index `entityPlayer`
@here anyone know?^^
[INFO] - [Magic Pen] Error in PostUpdate call: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/magic pen/main.lua:8: attempt to index a nil value (global 'entityPlayer')
Maybe just alter art to look like Flipnotes with the whole Red,Black and Blue color scheme
or is it bottom center?
Yeah I remember my old DSi
you can see the layers in the bottom left of the animation editor
yeah, that makes sence, thankyou
each animation has "layers" of images
what is a layerid?
yeah so check Room:IsClear() in your update and if it is clear, trigger your room cleared stuff. you'll still need a flag.
I made the mistake of assuming he already went through the docs.
you'll also need a flag that checks whether the clear_room trigger has happened that resets when you enter a new hostile room
Wouldn't `Room:IsClear()` be better for this?
trigger cleared room
if there aren't any enemies in the list of entities
on update
how can I make a trigger for clearing a room?
I still have a DSI
omg
Imagine if someone made Boi ab+ look like the old Flipnotes DSi thing
Ive got it
what elven princess has is correct
[INFO] - ERR: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/magic pen/main.lua:8: ')' expected near 'Pen'
see how you're declaring local my_trinket?
you want has_trinket to reference the variable from the line above
Then your 7 and 8 lines of code should be this:

```lua
    local my_trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName("Magic Pen")
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasTrinket(my_trinket)
```
hang on
yeah collectible is wrong
because it's searching for items not trinkets I think?
but that's wrong
```    local my_trinket = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("My Trinket")
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible(my_trinket)```
I just fixed it?
local my_trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName("Magic Pen")
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasTrinket("Magic Pen")?
oh lol I probably put the wrong function in then
do I have to Load the spritesheet to use it ?
No im making a trinket
You're making an item, right? Not a trinket?
wait when you say my trinket you just mean:
has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible(Magic Pen)
Yeah, it should be `my_trinket` instead of `"Magic Pen"`.
I have this so far
has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible("Magic Pen")
Wait so I shouldnt have ""
<@195368190333812736> Oh, sorry, it actually should be ```lua
     has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible(my_trinket)
```
would I have to use the NPC_UPDATE callback?
How can I make a trigger for clearing a room?
I don't think so.
Anything else you can see?
```lua
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible(Magic Pen)
```
on line 8 should be
```lua
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible("Magic Pen")
```
<@116386733905412105> Do you know what is wrong with this code?
https://hastebin.com/uxabivapub.lua
ah, thanks!
Yes, you'll know that it'll update if the "View Mod" button is active before you upload if I remember correctly
to update my mod on the workshop, do i simply upload it again under the same name with the modloader?
I had to use holywater
PLAYER_CREEP_RED isnt working for me
ahh okay
and one that glows
and one that doesn't
ohh yeah like a red creep that does hurt you
I can think of two enemies that leave red creep
I'm sure there's more than one kind of red creep
But what would the sub type of the creep mean becuase there is all diffrent ones like green_creep and creep_yellow
so 3 is the subtype
How would I slow down already shot tears? I'd assume it's `EntityTear.ContinueVelocity`, but it doesn't seem to work.
type, variant, subtype
What does the number 3 mean in this?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.PLAYER_CREEP_RED, 3, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
but yeah, replace sprite:Load with sprite:whatever_you_use_to_replace_spritesheet
I could probably preload it and then just reference it for later
I'm using the animations
Just replace the spritesheet with png, unless you absolutely need custom animations
Don't load an entire anm2
Dude
urm
this is what I use to apply my custom tear art to my regular tears.
```lua
        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                --local entityTear = entities[i]:ToTear()

                if entities[i].Variant == 0 then
                    entities[i].Variant = 33
                    --entities[i]:ChangeVariant(33)
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
                    local anim = "RegularTear" .. math.min(math.max(math.floor(entities[i].CollisionDamage), 1), 13)
                    sprite:Play(anim, true)
                    -- DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH WUBWUB WORM
                end
            end
        end
```
...the class?
whats the class for getting tear sprite?
And replace the spritesheet
You can get the sprite of the tear
do you mean a tear variant? or just the art from a tear variant?
WEll
what do you mean by skin
how would i apply one of the skins to my tears?
Ahh okay
"timer = has_trinket and (timer - 1) or 900" is the same as "if has_trinket then timer = timer - 1 else timer = 900 end"
I used a little lua cheat for one line
Is there a red creep trail?
Yeah thanks Im reading over it
oh ok there you go
I assume opacity but let me check
It's opacity.
what does the 4th number in color do?
you should try to understand it though.
probably?
Could I copy this and just change the names?
```lua
local examplemod = RegisterMod( "mod_folder", 1 )

local timer = 900
local has_trinket = false

function examplemod:updateCallback()
    local my_trinket = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("My Trinket")
    has_trinket = entityPlayer:HasCollectible(my_trinket)

    timer = has_trinket and (timer - 1) or 900
    if timer <= 0 then
        -- Do what you want to do every 30 seconds.
        timer = 900
    end
end

examplemod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, examplemod.updateCallback)
```
let me make some example code...
wtf how the hell do I do that lol
if the timer hits 0 or less, trigger whatever you want to trigger then set the variable back to 900
in your update callback, check if the trinket is held. if it is, tick the timer down by 1
when the trinket is picked up, set this variable to 900 to indicate we wanna wait 30 seconds
this is your timer's counter
you need a variable outside of any function
Alright how do I do a timer?
man I still gotta cut 25 cards from this edh deck
definitely go the timer route lol
Okay cool thanks
that only ticks down each frame if the trinket is held.
alternatively you could just set up a timer.
and then instead of 0 you do the frame the trinket was picked up % 900
so if the frame count is divisible by 900, you're on the 30th second or the 60th second or the 90th second etc
Yeah thought so.
30 * 30 = 900
well how many frames is 30 seconds?
well whatever the number of frames you want.
I need it to detect every 30 seconds
No isnt 30 frames 1 second?
if the frame count is divisible by 900?
if Game():GetFrameCount() % 900 == 0 then
if Game():GetFrameCount() == 900 then
but then how do I 'reset' the frame count after it does that?
proabbly useing GetFrame()
Anyone know how to something every 30 seconds if the player has the trinket?
Like spawn a trail/creep every 30 seconds if the player has the trinket
anyone know how the AddBlueFlys works, im struggling with it
of course guess ill just have to keep using my Lua code for that
unless a boss has a specific itempool
doubt it
can you set if it can spawn durring specific bosses on the itempool
it doesn't match the unpacked itempools, I am aware
so replace id="#" with name="name"
you use their name
custom items ids change when you have more then one mod loaded so it wouldnt work when more then one mod is loaded.
Hm?
how would that work?
I'm just wondering how I can add a custom trinket into the trinket drop list
but the ids change
Yup. With a custom itempools.xml in your content folder you can add your items to any item pool
itempools.xml works now
yeah
wait you can add items to item pool now?
me too.. tomorrow again see how to made the troll bombs..
ok bois i'm gonna sleep
I know you can add items to items pools now with the new update, but how do Trinkets work?
Its no problam. Happy modding :D
but many thanks for your help with this
yeah, its just working with tables like this is new to me
if you dont, it will set currentSeed to nil every time it runs
make sure you put the currentSeed outside of the function
oh right i see, myb i was trying to set both seeds to a seperate var and compare the two
https://hastebin.com/jowotahibo.lua
but how do i make entering the new room not jsut set the same seed to both vars
so i use the update callback to set the current room's seed to a var
yeah boiiii
whats thr problam?
ok im struggling with this checking new room thing -.-
Apparently
isaac updated?
well i try this... but yhe bomb not move >.< 
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_BOMBDROP,BombVariant.BOMB_BOBBY ,BombSubType.BOMB_SUPERTROLL,v.Position,v.Velocity,ply)
but homing bombs are a thing in the game
i need create a passive item with my bombs change to a supertroll bombs to target enemies (or if not hava a enemies target not change)
why do you want this anyway?
:/ if only the bomb entity can set the AddCharmed() :/
so I dont recommend that
one script would be forcign it at the player, and yours would be otherwise
you'd be fighting over the other programming
and then... how to generate a velocity to change to redirect to another entity?
I think its always dedicated to the player
any know how to change the targe to a supertroll bomb?
np
anyway thanks guys
:c
<@112975821186031616> with Room:IsFirstVisit it wouldnt
i thought so, breadmund is just being difficult again
it returns true or false
If you got teleported to the same room with it, the decoration seed would be the same and wouldn't proc, wouldn't it?
hang what does IsFirstVisit() return, the documention is confuseing me
it would though.
Not accounting for something like Curse of the Maze.
Mostly, yeah.
they have the same result
lol, i didnt even see that check
Mine doesn't check if it's the first visit.
well my way and Room:IsFirstVisit() would work the exact same as his
but it would be something ill iron out later
well it would
it wouldent matter for me as ill be looking for isclear too
<@112975821186031616> my way works best for active, your's are for passive
<@166265383291060224> yup
Hello... any know how to change the targe of a supertroll bomb?
Also have to consider Curse of the Maze. If you want it to trigger from that even if landing in the same room, I think mine would be better. If you don't, his would be.
i would assume its useing ``` Room:GetDecorationSeed()```
well, kinda the same thing. Anything that is garenteed to only be in that room works
nope
Woudn't simply comparing if it's the first frame of the room be easier?
no problam, I got a snippet of code if you need it
hmm, cleaver thankyou
xd the void items sucked up dont re-appear when you continue a run
no.Use MC_POST_UPDATE. get the current room decoration seed and have another variable keepign track of the last one, compair the two. if they are differnt trigger the code and let the last one to current
is there like a flag or something?
we do that manually
so i wonder how to make that a trigger
hmm and yet there are items that trigger events when entering a room
nothing goes on every room though
I think
Every frame
or is it post render on literary everything?
on entering a room?
When does the post render callback trigger?
thanks
<@266032468853915650> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n8en0/tear_flags_explained/ I don't know if this will be helpful but Its all I got. Havent done much with tears
np
TY <3
player:AnimateCollectible(modItem, "HideItem", "Idle")
i tried that but im not sure how to make it stop after that :c
Snippet from the "Black Hole" mod
player:AnimateCollectible(modItem, "LiftItem", "Idle")
hello, someone know how to made isaac hold up the active item on use? im really bad at this :c
for all the things I see TearFlag is always player.TearFlag
no
did doing only the homing work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_3TlrZLpQ0
balls to the wall
that's another effect
no
That lets it hom in?
but jacob's ladder works fine lol
I think that inorder to change a flag you have to say that the item is going to use the flag in the XML. Like when you change Isaac's stats
here's my code
```  local t = player:FireTear(e.Position,Vector(-e.Velocity.X, -e.Velocity.Y),false,false,true)
   cooldown = 3
   t:ChangeVariant(1)
     t.TearFlags = TearFlags.TEAR_JACOBS_LADDER
     t.TearFlags = t.TearFlags | TearFlags.TEAR_HOMING```
?
Do you have to catch the flag to change it?
wait no, theat a multiplier
homing strength?
hmm
hmm nope still going straight
let me test it
hmm
they have an attribute called HomingFriction. That might have soemthing to do with it
check TearParams and TearEntity
hmm got any idea on how to do that?
such as the intensity of it
I think you have to set a few tear params for the homing stuff
does the HOMING tear flag just doesn't work?
yeah liek the developer's group chat
group chat?
i'm on the group chat tho xd
and that's not what this is for
ahh
i'm not too involved in it
just kidding. What is shitbirth going to be?
pfft
too bad you took my idea <:plum:259939492008296448>
thanks
also, your mirror mod is pretty cool
best debug text 2017
"ok"
these look menacing
D:
so I still don't have access to my gosh-darned custom tear variant
because you can't cast to a tear
is you can't access any of the tear information on something taken out of the list of entities
well the problem
yup
I guess it's readonly?
pranked by ab+ yet again
yeah nevermind there isn't
I still don't see it in the documentation... let me see if there's an updated version
i think there is now
because there's no ToTear()
is what I used to read the damage of an individual tear
Entity.CollisionDamage
uh
oh. i'll have to find it
edmund retweeted it so it's no secret anymore lol
ha so...whats the idea? wont steal promise <:plum:259939492008296448>
lmao I just got subtweeted by a french dude telling another french dude to steal my mod idea xD
How do you damage isaac?
np
Does Entity.CollisionDamage do anything? I've set it to 10 but nothing changes
Thanks for help today
nice
whatever
or non-static typed
yes, lua is weak typed
<@266032468853915650> https://goo.gl/photos/hVCGywYTgA7HAfYh7
im like 2% there lol

Lua, weak typed?

someone judge my piece of shit sprite pls thank
c#, maybe
im adding support for c# and c++
i dont like weak typed languages ;_;
that's when it becomes a fuckhouse
we don't need more than one language
k
no
Would anyone be interested in java mod support for the game?
smh
Nope, that's the cracked die
what
but a pickup
Haha let me upload a video maybe
its just a d6
holy fuck the cracked D6 is so fun

ok
Peace out gotta f5 amazon all night.
<@266032468853915650> This weekend I'll finish the other dice and upload the mod, I'll let you know when it's done lol
can I just pull up any number thats not one of the variant numbers?
or do I make it the same as one of them?
Do I make it different than any of those ids?
look at the exported ones from the game
Right now the variant is just the same as the chest
<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
    <entity anm2path="005.050_Chest.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="3" collisionRadius="12" friction="1" id="5" name="Rotting Chest" numGridCollisionPoints="24" shadowSize="28" stageHP="0" variant="50">

        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />

    <preload-snd id="22" /> <!-- CHEST_OPEN -->
    </entity>
</entities>
In the entities file, how do I know what variant to make my entity?
have no idea whats wrong
im stuck
well fuck

Thanks you, should be able to work it out now
;_;
but what the fuck is wrong with the callback npc nto having fields
notepad dosent decode utf very well lol
try notepad++
WHAT THE FUCK
what the fuck

does involve alot of physics
and Grid
<@168775690152443925> thanks for the help
*position
I am afraid to mess with mirror
ooof no idea lol
```mirror.Position = mirror.Position:Lerp(mirror.Position, player.Position, 10)``` anyone knows what's wrong?
but once the reroll is started, it rerolls every second until the item is poop or you pick it up
``mymod:--[[anydamnothingyouwant]]() `` just make sure the callback for it.
rerolls with a 1/4 chance to turn the item into poop
Hahaha this item is so fun
demn
just call mymod:myusefunction()
<@146070361929154560> yeah.
Don't need to call UseActiveItem()
Not a random drop at end of room?
<@266032468853915650> HOLY SHIT I GOT IT!
Oh, so its just a check to see when the player enters the room at first?
not something like (Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoom():Roomcleared())
<@146070361929154560> its also not clearing the room though its entering.
why is (Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoom():GetFrameCount() == 1)
What I dont understand is
is anyone else having issues with the MC_NPC_UPDATE callbaks ;_;
It's borked
<@146070361929154560> haha yeah 1/40 don't know why he put 15 and not just 1.
I don't think so
from my understanding, its a 1/40 chance to spawn it when clearing the room right?
<@266032468853915650> Have you ever used UseActiveItem()?
getting nil on fields
What kind of item should I make ?
http://i.imgur.com/dKT00jl.png
yo has the lua api changed?
This function's from the armored heart mod

#BUG
It looks like UseActiveItem() crashes the game no matter what
Wow
Okay but how is that even close to "dead"?
If you arnt known well there, you are kind of ignored
:o can i get the pdn palette for isaac
I don't understand how you can say the spriting channel is dead?
fucking retard, looking at the toolbar
oh, I see now
Why not just Google it.
?
no option for saving as a pallete
doesn't matter
because the spriting channel is dead + lame
Why are you asking the modding channel about spriting that's off topic.
but you're better off not using one
thanks
click on the folder and then select "save current palette as..."
yes, when you relaunch the game
how do I save a pallete or something in paint.net
And do mods get downloaded there automatically?
ah, thanks!
documents > my games > binding of Isaac afterbirth + mods
or where does the mod download to?
where's the mod folder located?
subscribe to updates and shit
thanks!
that makes sense, kinda!
OHHHHHHHHHHH
oh
same thing
Sub
subscribe
yeah, theres no download button
Workshop?
oh
Maybe i'm just stupid, but how do I download mods?
If your item has the cache="blahblah random cache" in its XML it will update every time you pick it up and lose it.
that's what the shitty tutorial said anywa
only occurs once you get the item I belive
adding damage and shit
updating caches
practice caches?
I need to practice caches
what drug should I make
anyway
Also that channel is not "dead"
Practice.. You can't just magically make good sprites... ?
before you say <#267353315073982465> that fucking channel is dead
how do you make good sprites
anyone know how to use the Built-In Lerp function?
<@267112861921181697> TemporaryEffects is what you want to use for a tear type for one room.
thank you
I think I at least half understand how to make my chest variant now
wheres the pixel tool in gimp
ah
I believe it just tries to open the chest regardless of where it is.
My best guess is that it checks if Isaac's touching it.
What's this function do?

and its just not there
I looked through the active item list
I'm not really sure its even possible yet
Make the item's affect stop when you exit the room
downloading GIMP to do that resize thing that pople do to make Isaac sprites
I meant like in the form of an active item
or try and look through other mods
you could try messing with the update function
I'm not 100% sure that there's a room enter / room leave function
how do I make an effect only last for one room? I have a friend who cant code but wants to make a drug mod imo
Thank you
ah
Pickup
Or are they just their own bag?
Would chests fall under entitynpc or entitypickup?
With TemporaryEffects you have to run it at least each time you enter a room.
<@267112861921181697> with tearflags you can apply it and then not have to continue running code for it to still be active on the player.
Wait what are you trying to do?
I needed to convert it to a pickup specifically using ToPickup()
Thanks!
oh no you were right!
how can I get CollectibleType from an EntityPickup though?
like I understand synergies
whats the point in tear flags if you cant make custom tears tho
CollectibleType COLLECTIBLE_NULL
hallo
also nil damn lol
hmmm maybe I can use price
Might be its Variant then. Let me check.
collectibles have no subtype
That might not be the right syntax just so you know.
I'll try it thanks
Something alone the lines of ``` if entity.SubType == COLLECTIBLE_NULL then```
I think its subtype is null in that state.
i'm not sure if you can tho
but it can still be rerolled lol
once you pick it up it's an empty pedestal
Would it be better to add a temporary collectible effect to tears or use tearflags?
yeah
like, if the item has been picked up?
<@266032468853915650> Do you know how to tell if an item pedestal has an actual pickup on it or not?
I'm pretty sure someone was asking around about adding a new item to transformation and I was seeing a lot of no.
so da
nope, all 'growth hormones' has for example is the regular cache, description, name, id and gfx
not as far as i can tell
Do they have a flag in items.xml?
no idea sorry
hmm interesting idea
anyone know if you can make custom items work towards a transformation that's in the base game? so i can make, for example, a syringe that counts towards 'Spun'?
Hmm looks like it's setting the value of timer to 2 again that crashes it
idk then
log.txt just says "caught exception, writing minidump..."
log.txt
<@266032468853915650> Possible to read the .dmp file?
Okay lol it worked but crashed -_-
np
Thank you!
Well, now I know
Hahahaha I had that error before and I coded around it
also, thanks for the reaction, <@216324079504982016>
happened multiple times before
i know the feeling man it's really enraging
fuck me
it's local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0) not local player = Isaac:GetPlayer(0)
i dont blame you for this, seriously
facepalm
getting there ?
holy shit it's massive
Here is all of it
https://hastebin.com/adukusomaj.lua
there could be stuff like if you have another player variable active and stuff
yeah that's what I thought
also fine
crackedDiceMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, crackedDiceMod.timer)
the code seems fine
I'm calling that function with:
I can put it all on Git
What else do you need?
like, the whole code
https://hastebin.com/latutifumu.vbs
get the code on hastebin
lmao
I'm in the timer function
oops caps
HOW'S YOUR GETPLAYER?
error in postupdate call... calling "GetPlayer" on bad self (number expected got table)
any idea about this error?
<@266032468853915650> almost got it!
probably not ancient astronauts though
no idea sorry
ayy liens
aliens
nvm
why do i keep getting "attempt to call a nil value (global 'RegisterMod')"
lmao
interesting, very cool
^ can not != cannot
you can not give the item in the callback and it triggers with every item
0h
oooh you mean useItem already exists?
>crackedDiceMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, crackedDiceMod.D6reroll, crackedD6)
I figured you didn't since you provide the item in the callback
you have to check if the item is your item
mod:useItem(item) is the function that gets called on MC_USE_ITEM callback
This is good though, I think this implementation will work
so the mod:useItem(item), that's specific to my active use item correct?
okay lol thanks
btw i mispelled function on the 2nd function
https://hastebin.com/tanukamiwu.vbs here you go
i'm making some code
use a postupdate callback?
I put it outside my active item?
i think this timer works for that
ok
but I need the player to be able to move during those two seconds
Use the item, and there is a chance it will repeat every 2s
"For now we strongly recommend running workshop mods only with --luadebug disabled." -Tyrone
Really, I'm making this a recursive function
I just need to be able to make a timer
they will if they want to play the OG mods that import timer libraries
I'm not worried about efficiency at this point in time
so what's the point
lame
yeah but no player will ever have that
i think you can still do require if you have luadebug on
Like how do I implement it
<@266032468853915650> How does it work?
i dont think you can do that anymore
yea with require
You can import?
yes it is a horrible timer
y not just import a timer library
```local timer = 0

function mod:update()
    if Game():GetFrameCount() % 60 == 0 and timer > 0 then
        timer = timer - 1
    end
end```
i think that'd be really hard to do
because i have no idea how to do that
sadly no
<@129475107583295488> nice! will it keep costume details during the roll?
spin to win http://i.imgur.com/WJmQYsT.gif
Lol someone once said "If it's ugly and it works, it's not ugly..." <@109624258317033472>
okay np
let me get it 1 sec lol
so i'm going to tell you a timer that's probably bery inneficient
ok
So it's always 0
because while it's calculating the current frame - the start frame, it doesn't move any new frames
I try to use while loops to wait, but they end up being infinite
https://github.com/atomoton/crackedDice/blob/master/main.lua
seconds
how precise do you want it? ticks? frames? seconds?
Also you tried and timed stuff? How can I make a timer?
I can upload it as is, incomplete, but not to steam yet lol
You want to see it?
<@266032468853915650> Ah sort of, nothing new on there yet, I was hoping to wait until I get a few more dice done
<@266706294306635776> did you get the github page up ?
Or what about how to add charge to an item
programmatically  I mean
any ideas on how to wait a certain amount of time before redoing something?
Can anyone help? I'm really stumped
I lot a really OP isaac run to Hush
That was a response to the door that opens Void without killing Hush
Aw fuck
i DO
Ayeverybody
3 being the amount of flies they would get
Can someone help me? If I wanted to make it so when the player picks up hearts they get blue flies, then what would I put in the lua? would it be 
if player:Addhearts then 
player:AddBlueFlies(3)?
Thanks
good luck wth you problem
Bye
gotta go
anyways
Trying Has Collectible
Nop
try putting GreedGuide instead of "A Greeds Guide"

you can put GreedGuide in there
nono
Was told by <@109624258317033472> you didnt
you need those " things around strings

<@!174193097285173250> not really xD

Rip doesnt work
Yeah forgot that
GreedGuide
but your item
but you do not write (item) in the HasCollectible function
okay
this is correct
or do I put end at the bottom
So like this?
https://hastebin.com/paxafaxeda.lua
so the rest of the code doest get executed
'return' basicly cancels the function
nono. you put in it the function on the very top
I dont understand where to put it do I put it over the function?
no
Does the item name need "" around it?
cool
if player:HasCollectible(item) then return end
:
is it
if player.HasCollectble(item) then
?
above everything else
Where do I put that into the code?
if not use GetActiveItem
sure
Does HasCollectible work for Active items?
no idea sorry
Heres the code:
https://hastebin.com/jitumewoco.lua
Yeah when you use it
have you give your item as parameter in AddCallback?
that shouldnt happen
wait an active item?
check for HasCollectble(item)
Like my mod is an active item. And when I use another it uses my mod
wat
Anyone know when I use other mods it uses mine?
bye ^^
bye!
mfw I've spent over 3 days on one item and it still doesn't work perfectly and an hour on its counterpart and it seems to work perfect
<@229593818691928067> your isaac isaac is isaacs
EntityCollisionClass sounds right, but I don't know how to set it
no idea
that exists?
btw there's EntityCollisionClass and GridCollisionClass but what is EntityGridCollisionClass used for ?
EntityCollisionClass is correctly set?
mmh
its set to 13 at the moment (just copied dry baby)
if you havent done that
collision radius has to be set to something higher in the entities2.xml file
Hi, I've managed to create a custom familiar that follows me around but I want it to have an effect played when it gets hit, similar to dry baby. I've made a function that gets called whenever a familiar gets hit at the moment (to test that it works, which is does with other famailiars) but bullets just go straight through my custom familiar. Is there something I need to set that causes it to be able to take damage?
oke. my bad then ^^
variant is not set automatically
No dude
"One last Isaac"
ok
"Your Isaac has become Isaac"
could someone install it and make sure it works ?
well it's done ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840930153
Oh YES
hahaha
reminds me of moms spaghetti
that video is legendary
xD
especially with the hair x.x
how cool would it be to have that intro in the game !?
it was a lot of work
welp, I made my chars head
guys you know that video ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMR0Aldn6WU
ok, will try
thats nice
ic
im pretty sure that if you choose an already existing ID, the variant will be automaticly assigned too
But if 2 mods add custom tears and variants are the same i think the game will crash
^
aren't the item ids are set automatically?
i'm just saying if two different item-adding mods used the same item ID would they still be compatible or would a ptch be needed
<@97347967329005568>
Who?
what if they happen to use t he same id?
fuck
oh. xD
<@97347967329005568> it should be good now
lol
i am russian
i thought only russians do ))))
)) -> ? -> ?
that evolution from your smiley was astonishing
so are item adding mods able to be compatible with each other now or is that still not gonna happen unless people manually combine them like you did with rebirth modding?
i know ?
<@223869207748542464> hell no, i was kiddin ^^
Still no access to the ItemPool class though
<@109624258317033472> if u want u can take the idea
yep thats true ^^
that you can actually put stuff in item pools now?
so is it true
lol
Kappa
stop stealin
Oh, that's The Invader.
also, that idea was meant for me! D:
Isn't that in Antibirth?
https://twitter.com/FTBEtchin/status/819490271507476480
yeah
or FAMILIAR
<@85575792645386240> holy shit thats cool ?
what does it do
And if you stay on a floor for too long you might have to take damage to get out?
THX
Dude
Active item Space Invader
How about a mod where the world slowly falls apart
Okay she's alive lol

D:
<@229593818691928067>
OH THX
Mod ideas, mod ideas, mmm
Mario?
Space Invader ? :p
On another note, its been like 2 hours and i cant find a good mod idea i could do.
Lol sure sure
if its ugly and it works, i aint ugly
Damn lol okay
So with code you mean just check if they're that character, then remove the item they start with and replace it with the new item?
well. you could do it with code. i dont think this is possible in the players.xml tho
511 will usually end up being some other mod
without using the id 511?
Do you know how to make a character start with a custom item?
shoot away
<@109624258317033472>  I have a question for you
Heeeelllo all
he is the best!
RoboBaby is god
Robobaby
xD
oh
Robo Baby knows whats up
the only good melon is honeydew melon..
Please
xD
it should add bob xd that would be original xd starts with ipecac
I think of him as false melon, impostor melon, wannabe melon, or farce melon
No
does it add adam from community remix
Finn, this is easy. Trust Melon is Melon and melon(limt) is melon
does ipecac mod add a new character at all
ipechat
<@124248443383185408> It doesn't matter when he joined the server. You started being active after him.
ipecac chat
Yeah, I was just posting random comments.
When did you join the server
Okay
Okay
no what's that
Limt do you have a steam
In Ipecac chat, we always have to clarify who is who.
Well, the names are kind of confusing.
I'm getting tired of false melon's repugnant fawning over me
You changed names
<@222955859179732992> <@250099699380387841>
But you were originally called those names
he's so many finn robots
don't forget Finn the Robot 2 and 3
It's just like how I'm Pissy Monobrow, Finn the Robot, and 19steind.
xD

I have nicknames fool!!!
If you were melon
Then why did people use to call you limt
GabeN

I've been melon for 7 years, and in that time I have remained the best melon there ever was
It was just limt on Discord.
You are not the original one
It has always been melon.
Therefore
You changed your name to melon after I got here
You can't deny the trivia
I'll tear you in half
yea antibirth too
Trivia: Limt literally copies and pasted the last portion of my name
or antibirth lol
half the items in ab+ are copies of other ab or rebirth items
why am i not surprised
trivia: nicalis literally copied and pasted to inflate the item count
lol
The only interesting fact about this item is that it is the exact same thing as another item.
except that the head is melon shaped
that hardly resembles my silhouette

shade me all you like
That's what he always sounds like.
you sound shady >->
GitLab
I don't share!!!
<@145740433165647873> i want facts behind that statement. Whats your github?
i did want a good text engine for hellbound
Therefore her dreams didn't come true
yes
The little girl didn't want what was done to her
I've coded so many things I couldn't count them all, I'd have to code something to count them for me
melon made a little girl's dreams come true
well thats something
melon coded a sword
TheSwiftTiger cannot vouch because hes biased
good idea, Kyo
White basement is better
ok.. i'm coming back later when stuff has settled o.o
<@128874748041101312> vouch for me having coded a melon
Green basement
Proof
i want proof
yeah of course
have you, <@145740433165647873> ?
my feet smell like... oh my god... *dead*
No, pajeet's feet smell like curry.
I bet you've never even coded a melon
yeah
i think ur getting melon confused with pajeet...
His feet smell like oak wood.
Bad cheese
Nope
And not good cheese
my feet smell like cinnamon
Your feet smell like cheese
if 2 melons got in the ring trust melon would lose instantly
I have a counter argument now

i have TrustinMelon ?
ok
I do

and who have a ring?
Battle of two melons
#TeamWhatIsGoingOnHere

I'm going to report the Black Isaac mod because it copies off of mine.
#TeamTheBindingOfWhitesaacIsBetterThanTheBindingOfGreensacOrWhateverIt'sCalled
hi bro <@266032468853915650>, don't want to sign a petition?
#TeamIDon'tEvenWantToJoinATeam
<@124248443383185408> You only started being active in this server because of your obsession with Antibirth.
#TeamIJustGotHere
and that concludes his counterargument
Ehhh
Well for one

I heard he doesn't finish his args, for one thing
Trust Melon isn't even good.

I'll report u so fast
Make me
yay!
leave
more melons
?*
You called:
you are melon, that's why ?
lemme sample that green
my green is like 100x better
you should've labeled it as "rough idea"
well that's what she said
its the pretty fucking same xD
<@175392549035442177> That was a rough idea not by an artist.
my green is better
green is your name color melon
ur nick is green <@145740433165647873> lol
that green is honestly weird, i love the drawing tho ?
"much more talented artists on the team"
? green
sweet ^^
wow
that's cool
lol that green
Since this was posted publicly, I think I can post it here.
walking backwards
moonwalking as well
This pic again ? <:whipper:259939519061688320>
cool
rainbow zombie?
nothin wrong with that
http://i.imgur.com/Efjyg2N.gifv
Because there are much more talented artists on the team.
Didn't even notice his name Kappa
I barely made any sprites.
<@175392549035442177> No.
guys, now stop bashing Monobrow ^^
was it you
who made the old one
Someone on the team
oh
I forget who made it.
you haven't seen my sprites (;
It's not my sprite.
<@!182509747835109387> dude, your sprites look godly compared to mine
Just kidding
Then stop posting shit ? ( ?° ?? ?°)
you have to make it more obvious or else it looks like they're just overlapped
Because I get criticized no matter what I post.
I probably shouldn't have shown off the new sprites.
no it's not
where's the sew marks
is it you ?
They're sewed together.
that's because they did
it looks like it has one of those weird texture mesh things on it too
c'est moi
who is tipo19 on reddit ?
it also looks like you overlapped one heart over the other and called it a day
red
2.5k for me ( ?° ?? ?°)
demon role should be a hideous beige imo
1k hours
yep
but that means you play gd ( ?° ?? ?°)
that was a hideous beige
2.1 won't be realesed
i wanna know who made the old mask + heart recolor
ikr
chill
dude
fake name
creator of gd
robert topala ?
wtf
<@223869207748542464> Im full in! only 98  to go!
and an almost unpronouncable name
<@!182509747835109387> that's a funky-looking tree
why not?
no
GUYS I MADE A PETITION!
https://www.change.org/p/moderators-add-a-new-role-team-angle-to-discord-server-called-modding-of-isaac
This is the new sprite for the Amygdala:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/181177371955560448/259469893571837952/Amygdala.png
And this was made before Antibirth was announced
that's poor viseg
but couldn't quite get the chains on correctly
<@175392549035442177> It was experimented on.
he must've been a big fan of the visage
melon still savage af
the shading seems a lil off
not sure why he's all chained up like that
especially the piss stream
Thank you.
it looks decent but it's not isaac-esq lol
to be fair, that actually looks decent ^^
I mean it's less ungood
well uhh
I told you the new sprite was good.
mimimimi
beaf
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/209463813869797377/259422652362522626/the_bivalve2.png
boy, there really is some beef going on between Demon And Angel
I'll skin you alive fucker
hey you're a mod you're not allowed to be rude to people
that doesnt sound like you have one tbh. But proof me otherwise ^^
hah piss boy is trying frantically to add shading really quick to avoid embarrassment over what a poor sprite he drew
I'm trying to find it.
THERE IS A NEW SPRITE
im not sure what your thought process was when you got rid of all the shading
Jarate
Ain't that a peice of piss
did you piss in his eyehole, piss boy?
<@175392549035442177> That isn't the new sprite
the true hero
Damn
upscaled
tenfold
Im for it!
im gonna improve this sprite
^
so, what about angles?
wow
lol
so you're doing a community mod with sprites like this
was there a time where RoboBaby 2.0 was RoboBaby 1.0?
Steven the Steven
^^
Finn the Robot is my screen name.
Kek
thanks
ah okay
The Human
About what?
whos finn?
Yes
wait finn is doing the ipecac community mod?
makes sense
oh, kay
<@109624258317033472> There aren't less people. There are just less online people.
i wanted to ask you about that.
mimimimimi
Yeah
what about adding third team! ANGLES!
<@223869207748542464> that might be true. damn
so
also, how can it be that the angle team was full when there are way less people in there than in the demon team? xD
i think the game would crashs, or at least lag if u will fire a brimstone form 1 end of room to another...(endless room, like all call it)
Most of which aren't final
great!
Then im currently left over pizza
And a lot of sprites
We have about 6 items done now
you are what you eat!
wow that's a lot of toos
<@109624258317033472> Yes
I've got around 30 in a big box
i have about 6 in my back yard
hey guys how many tools do you have
is this ipecac-mod thing even doing anything?
continue to criticize everything he says imo
and the brimstone-gapers ? shit, you could actually so some really neat stuff with an Isaac endlessrunner
No need to criticize everything I say
<@175392549035442177> It's an inside joke
also, those gapers who gravity-surge all tings around them
we're too afraid to have to compete with ipecac to give you the tools
Super Issac Run
Hey, Super Mario Run is worth 10 dollars.
<@!182509747835109387> why do you think that people would give you the tools
And items
And put rocks
free for the first 3 stages
and put in microtransactions
no, make it free
<@145740433165647873> Give me Isaac C++ tools all files
charge 10 dollars for it limt
super isaac run
good idea
Try to make it so like a bunch of bosses are chasing Isaac thru a endless hall
a whole new game, probably
Inviting everyone but me is the "cool" thing to do
i wonder if jer's made anything yet
Yeah, I assumed that was true.
yeah i just use it to diddle myself
yea i just do nothing with em
even A Small Hedge does
we're having the time of our life with them
sorry
yeah
everyone does but you
yeah sure
yes
So do Portal and Jer also have access to the C++ tools?
and I don't want to deal with ab+ api
I'm doing this BECAUSE the antibirth api is not ready yet
zilcho
<@145740433165647873>   How many penises did you give to Kil to get these tools?
Imagine the mod being just issac running endlessly faceing shiz
fair enough ^^
too busy coding
make the gif loop
feel free to edit it
also, im kinda disappointed that the gif doesnt loop ^^
but it could be any amount
100 tiles wide
hmm lets see
<@145740433165647873> how big is the room actually
<@!182509747835109387> woah no wayyyyyyy
A endless hallway filled with rocks,baddies and items
Issac run
It's C++ modding
isaac endless runner
i assume Antibirth api?
wait how
xD
the fuck

Well, your system fooled me, i had no other choice!
cry about it
Not as bad as purple though
psh, you greeny are worse than both groups >->
green - too fance to decide for one side
have fun with the losers ?
This is gonna be the cool side now!
MUHAHAHA
We get high damage items.
?
This is the cool side.
i hope we have cookies
ive joined the dark side

fair enough

^^^
what is your picture then? an angel? sure..
Why is it so important that you join the bandwagon? If you become a demon, you still get to use the legacy chat.
I aint no fucking demon D:
No worries I'm a nice demon
Just become a demon.
COME HERE ?
NO
haha
YES
nice
oh no
NEVER
lol
gfdgsfdgsfdgsdfgd
Ha

Have you considered, maybe, making a deal with the devil?
Sorry! Too many angels right now.
RoboBaby, i want to be an angel!
LUUL
Muahaha
lol
oops
**The pact is sealed.** You are now a <@&207206454992568320> :smiling_imp:
"i want to be a demon"
Try hanging around more.
You need to have at least **3** items if you expect me to make wings for you.
say "i want to be an angel"
where do I have to look at xD no idea
^^
also, the AI is a little messy but quite self explainatory if you look at it
they fooled me yesterday
Why do you care so much?
i dont know HOW D:
btw why aren't you an angel yet
winning condition would probably be 3 levels or so
how did you write the ai?
if it was a Custom challenge, what would be the winning condition ?
yeah i dont know how to balance things. i personally find it easy, but on the other hand, i wrote the AI
thanks mate ?
feels harder than real pacman though
<@109624258317033472> your minigame is great ?
oh
and I'm doing a bitwise or to put it into tear flags
I just made a variable equal to 1<<56
What do you mean?
<@72413153614368768> how?
My question is if I can get the tear flags of a tear while it's flying
Oh, cool.
That's not what I'm doing, I'm making a new tear flag. As in, 1<<56
You just combine two tear flags.
how?
I'm making my own tear flag
oh, you hear the discord sound? well. ¯\_(?)_/¯

yes I was the one spamming in Discord I'm sure Kappa
What do you mean by that, Monobrow?
<@120355885615808512> you are? <:isaac_eyebrow:245063314613338113>
Do you have a constructor with all the tear flags in them?
Is it the same as the TearFlags on the tears themselves?
Wait, how does the TearFlags thing in EntityPlayer work?
I'm attempting to create a custom tear effect, but the function that adds the tear effect to the tears can happen twice because I don't know how to check the flags of the tear while it's in-flight. Can anyone help me with this?
Has anyone figured out how to stop enemy tears from falling?
right that makes sense, i was useing an ID and it was getting upset at me, thanks
`local   item_monstro = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Monstro's Big Foot" )`
and "Monstro's Big Foot" is defined in items.xml
set in item.xml?
And Item_monstro is a custom item?
<@109624258317033472> great and nice that we are in the video too ?

Bois! My PacMan mod, Its up! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840619486
Give it a go and punch me with your critics and suggestions! ?
<@154701703474577408> if i may ask, what callback did you use for that check?
Is it possible to get the tear flags of a tear that's flying through the air?
<@249974366106943489> Sorry, I was away, but I told you that you have to edit the animation to use a texture instead of the default text.  Include it with a changed name in your resources folder and load it from there instead.
i guess ill just heal the player
ROBOBABY!
oh, thanks
file
chose metadata.xml
how do i choose the folder?
it's a mod that just replaces .xml's and sprites etc
in the isaacFolder/tools
using modUploader
expendably dumb??
expendably dumb question, but.. how do i upload a mod?
Does Isaac.GetRoomEntities() only return Entity or will it return EntityTear/EntityBomb/EntityPlayer/EntityNPC depending on what type of entity it is?
oh, hi!
but it|s mz first mod so #shamelessselfpromotion
it|s kinda shittz tbh
btw http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840814967
ask the dude who uplaoded the mr skeltal mod
no idea
does anyone know how to set gifs as workshop preview images?
anyone knows?
ok cool thankyou
(it checks if you are playing as monstro jr, then if you are it grants you a starting item and a costume)
hope that helps
``` if (player:GetPlayerType() == Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName("Monstro Jr.")) then
        player:AddCollectible(item_monstro, 0, true)
        local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/Monstro.anm2")
        Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(costume)
    end```
my code
<@166265383291060224> one sec
or just how to check what charector the player is playing as
does anyone know what GetPlayerType() returns?
i tried returning false but it doesnt work
how can i block damage on MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG?
<@126590786945941504> It works smoothly, but there is also a default text with my effet_streak x) It render CELLAR 1 too (I'm at cellar 1). Do you know how I can remove it ?
Sure though, it will stretch everything under that
I believe the thumbnail is 512x512 as default
wouldn't be hard to rewrite it in something else so that it can run on windows
it's just two tiny files, one that handles the CLI and another one that handles the actual generation and it just stiches a few strings together, then stitches contents of files together, then pastes the main script
hmmm the source code for luamerger doesn't seem that complicated
Screens should be your isaac resolution :P
screens should be full hd i suppose?
thumbnail
Or, wait, do you mean screenshots or thumbnail?
Mine are 128x128 IIRC ¯\_(?)_/¯
what size should preview pics on the workshop have?
np
<@126590786945941504> Thank you very much !
coolstuff.lua ```lua
return {
  debug = Isaac.DebugString,
  _VERSION = "coolstuff 1.0"
}
``` main.lua ```lua
local coolstuff = require "coolstuff"
coolstuff.debug(coolstuff._VERSION)
```
You need to render it every frame basically :P
<@126590786945941504> OMG that's why it didn't work I need to use the callback x)
As that'll include all the movement and stretching
it works with isaac
niiiice
I'd also recommend copying the frames from the Center null if that's possible
sprite:Render(pos, Vector(0,0), Vector(0,0))
minor issue but still
sprite:Update()
And inside the render callback
so if you separate it into for example a `src` dir (to not have main.lua conflict), you need to actually go into the src directory and call it there with `-o ../main.lua`
sprite:Play("Text", true)
Then when you want to trigger the animation
sprite:Load("path.anm2", true)
instead of relative to the main file
relative to where you're calling it
Create Sprite()
one problem is that it generates the names of the modules
Basically
Before rendering ?
But that's the idea
Don't forget to play the animation
Do I use an empty Sprite(), then I load the ui_streak.anm2 and then I render the sprite ?
<@126590786945941504> Thanks for the answer ! How do I render it precisely ?
if I want to reskin an item do I replace the png file with the reskin?
So I have a question
But not the texture for the text
If you want I can do that for you too
As a sprite
And render it
<@249974366106943489> As far as we can tell, there's no built-in way to display the text, but you could edit ui_streak.anm2 yourself to include a texture for the text
the example
or rather
the examples are just standard lua
okay this doesn't look bad, but I'm yet to check if it actually works in isaac
Hi ! I want to make a transformation text like when the word GUPPY! spawns when your turn into him, do you know where is defined the animation that prints words to the screen ? And how can I draw this and the effect_streak to the screen ?
Aah. Thanks.
<@72413153614368768> he's banned for linking this server on a raid server of his IIRC
What about a bag of salt that looks like black powder but it keeps flying and ground enemies from crossing it
Is there any way to get the current highest item id in the game?
u just need to go to the folder where is ur gif and write name of it in select file window, press open(or select, idk, using not english win7)
The title uses Lua twice, it makes you go all "Oh, Lua"
<@126590786945941504> well yeah the post says it's written in crystal
¯\_(?)_/¯
cool
<@174505132292046849> I'm going to do the art for the items now, and then I'll upload. ETA max 3 hours
first mod in workshop that have gif preview instead of png
Nice, haha
thats possible? how cool is that!
Why's Zatherz banned here?
Also, don't get fooled by the way the title is written, it's not made in Lua
https://streamable.com/rz4gz
Gif animation instead of default pic
Considering he's banned here
It's funny seeing his stuff here
Zatherz, heh
gotta try it myself I guess
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840775359
anyone used this and knows if it works well? https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n7xto/linuxmac_only_luamerger_a_simple_lua_script/
Ipecac > Bob's Brain
always kills me
i hate ipecac
but that just adds to the FUN, right?
Now, a terrible synergy with that item is ipecac
?
well cant be that hard
not that bad
ewww
It's mainly a bit of trigonometry
Sure thing
i am just interested in how you did that ^^
Code not necessarily good
Will probably update today
My item?
is that od on the workshop? id like to see the code
Slowly smothering Isaac
True, just a bit funny
Don't fix it, synergies like this exist for a reason
fuck.. haha https://streamable.com/owc5b
thank you, dude
it works ?
like after evaluateItems
oh i could set current_room in the shoot function right?
also gtg
Or keep track of two flags, one for flying, one for speed
Either set whether there's a bonus outside of the cache update
Either two separate flags or a global flag
idea how to fix that?
again, ty
I'm not gonna judge that ¯\_(?)_/¯
ty
so stupid
ohhhhhhhh
Which means after one case is triggered, the other won't
You set the current_room in **both** cases
Oh, that's easy
why does it update my speed upon leaving room but not my flying
The code looks like you rewrote bits of it independently and repeatedly
The thing is
sure
yeah
Also, you checked in-game, not in the enums, right?
so its power of 2
I mean, just rewrite it, it's become a mess man
also the cacheflag is 16 or 128
what? ?
oh
<@174505132292046849> *There's so many things wrong in that code*
And, uh
speaking of getting stuff drawn, would someone here be willing to make a sprite for my item? I'm shit at pixel art.
But yeah, a sketch is a sketch
But it looks *awful* at the moment
I'm gonna be overly honest
Okay.
*flops over*
Go on, show us stuff when you get it actually drawn
You don't have to be rude about it haha
I mean
*does that match any style*
?
oh
yeah, i can tell just from it that it doesn't really match the style of Isaac
I'm gonna make it fresh don't worry
needs work
The outline, uh
No this is just the outline
wtf
Is that mspaint or what
What
*oh god*
http://prntscr.com/dut7kj
So I'm working on the sprites for what I dubbed "Deadly Sin Mode"
Check if they're all powers of 2
That's a neat item, Flipski!
alright
Try logging the cacheflag
also if i restart the run, or even the game, the variable "total" doesnt reset and i keep flying...
Oh shit, nice
I made a Void alternate https://streamable.com/27bjr
no nothing
Does it error anywhere in log.txt?
not always...
Holy shit, I got my item to work great! https://streamable.com/xyh7q
but he doesnt
what should happen is the player should gain ability of flight on some point
http://pastebin.com/gv50SeL5 irst of all the code
What's your problem?
maybe you can help
a while ago nobody had any clues anymore
might someone here want to help me with my leprosy mod?
You just smash space until you see icon it doesnt matter if you pick it up
?
I got mine item in like minute
nope
^
that IS rerolling for hours isnt it? xD
amazing
wow.
<@109624258317033472>
go to item room as isaac -> console -> debug 8
np ^^
(or equivalent)
All right, thank you, Scayze
What goddamn language uses `end` before `else/elseif`?
follow up question, how does one test if an item is in the itempool besides rerolling for hours?
I mean
Oi can someone test if my workshop mod actualy updated and now has working item pools?
Shit's whack, yo.
Welcome to lua
if
elseif
elseif
end
Gosh dangit.
the syntax is:
you dont do "end" for every elseif
*second
Or did I screw up and I'm not supposed to have an end on each elseif?
It's acting like the first elseif ends the entire seond for there.
https://hastebin.com/iteqonomeh.lua
ofc. you can.  whats your code?
Can we not chain multiple "elseif" lines to a thing anymore?
yes
Could i PM you ?
<@223869207748542464> yes
xddd
for debug
'PEW'
<@81035468866584576> this?

And an end to close for at line 24
But there is an end to close the elseif on line 20.

bananas ?

this thingy?
oh
no
<@223869207748542464> it's you who made the future helmet mod, right ?
https://hastebin.com/iteqonomeh.lua Anyone mind combing it here with me as I try to identify what needs to be changed?
An update to the API always has the potential to break stuff
It worked fine when I published it to workshop a few days ago, but I'm guessing the update since then broke it somehow.
It seems that now my mod doesn't work.
Hum.
rip, passive items have a charge of 0
and i think he got an item idea
amazing
and this API
i just said about black hole boss
i cant believe what some people can do with this game
no
that's your idea ? ?
or not
probably
idk
<@229593818691928067> when u feel that someone red ur message about blackhole boss and got an item idea out of it <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
yes
well. music is ogg isnt it?
damn that's impressive  https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5njxed/black_hole_throwable_active_item/
i made a music mod
dude
are there differnet kinds of .wav files?
OUCH. i just managed to replace a sound. but ingame, the sound is only static noise. its tremendously loud. what did i do? D:
who thought making mod save data cross- ingame save was a good idea
who
because red is a nice color?
Why did we default on red for debug string RenderText?
the frame count doesn't seem to reset if you press R to reset
`Game():GetFrameCount() == 1`
didn't work for me
to sleep, perchance to dream
bye
goodbye forever
I think it's about time I went to sleep forever. See ya'll tomorrow.
Yeah, hopefully.
I can just do some debug stuff though
Hopefully passive items have a charge of nil instead of a charge of 0
That could work.
Maybe check for an EntityPickup.Charge? Probably not 100% reliable.
A spacebar item
what do you mean active ?
Crap, is there a way to check if an item is active within lua?
wtf
i just restarted the game, and i am still flying
<@266032468853915650>
``t.TearFlags = tear.TearFlags | TearFlags.TEAR_PIERCING;``
As in, if you run the constructor yourself
<@266032468853915650> yes
Isn't `RNG()` completely unseeded?
lol
i tried that, it doesn't change between runs !
RNG():GetSeed()
That could work. Thanks!
<@266032468853915650> how do you get the seed though ?
<@72413153614368768> i did `if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then`
and compare to see if its continuing a run
you have to save the seed
Doesn't that callback happen when you continue a run as well?
that triggers also when continuing a run
MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT
I'm making an item similar to Void and I need to make sure it's empty on a new run
How would you detect if a run is started?
is it possible to set the tear flag of a tear you spawn like this? ```local t = Isaac.Spawn(2,0,0,e.Position,Vector(-e.Velocity.X, -e.Velocity.Y), player)```
but it doesnt want me to make it work
i want it to work
Fine.
no
Quit it.
guys i am despairing
Looks good.
<@229593818691928067> Nice design
I'd just made a bunch of Steak items that could be cooked at colored fires earlier, coincidentally.
really cool
<@229593818691928067> great mod btw
yeah 1 min ago i found it in workshop
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840727122
You'd probably get better support from <#267353315073982465> for that.
then first of all you gotta make the sprites
I wanted to make some sprites to animate
what do you want to do with it?
It's just really confusing
so I opened the animation editor, could someone help me?
kinda
i mean they do all kinda work
nope
Looks fine to me, unless you changed any of the function names.
```leprosyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, leprosyMod.shoot)
leprosyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, leprosyMod.render)
leprosyMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, leprosyMod.updateCache)```
i meant 3
4? I only see 3. Unless you added a new one.
Yes
should i post the code?
All of them
i have 4 callbacks
which one?
How are you adding the callback?
I'm new to the whole modding thing...
that's the line of code ```      Isaac.AddCallback(self, callbackId, fn, entityId)```
Close enough.
Ah.
Unless they changed it
No, main.lua only has the global `RegisterMod`
Hmmm.
`RegisterMod`
My guess: Line 7 in the official game's main.lua is the AddCallback which is having an issue with your code.
main.lua contains a function
Basically
Ah, nvm
Hold on
You...
that's a game file right
actually it says the eroor was found in resources/scripts/main.lua
oh wait
i can clearly see an error with the callback
Seems about right.
local current_room = nil
And what's line 7 in the code?
*You don't even have the callback*
bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got nil)
It's your code that I'm guessing would be carrying over.
*duh*
It has an error
Well then check your line 7
well the log says thers an error in line 7
It shouldn't
The built-in tool is kinda ugly compared to Basement Renovator, though. That being said I don't know how compatible the latter is with Afterbirth+.
why would the game save a cache from a previous run?
In case you were about to quit because you have to remove 10 things from one tile
You'll probably want to make checks to see if it's a new run. But heck if I know how the cache works.
Also, <@132926604358844418>, remember, **right-click copies the currently selected tile, overiwriting the target**
Check your log.txt
Oh thank you <@112975821186031616>
It's in the tools folder in the Afterbirth+ folder, <@132926604358844418>.
i was still flying...
and when i started a new run
Hey I'm a bit confused. I thought Afterbirth + came with a room editor or something, and I can't find it?
soooo, i just started flying when switched back into the game
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time the API was inaccurate, but all it says is "Reevaluate Damage, Firerate, Shot speed." for AddCacheFlags.
lol
uuuhhhm
And are you sure you don't have anything that gives you flight or something?
wtf
wait
yep
And you add the flying flag?
yep
You do AddCacheFlags before running EvaluateItems, right?
it works for speed but not for flying
but i do evaluateitems
I've only really dealt with modifying *other* entities. Not the player.
¯\_(?)_/¯
That's when it resets the appropriate stats and runs through the items, right?
Instead, you add the flags and run EvaluateItems
For that you should probably check to see if it's the first frame of a room and, if it is, to reset the total.
AddCacheFlags doesn't make the cache check by itself
and total does not reset upon entering a new room
If I'm reading the documentation right, AddCacheFlags just makes the cache check for updates, doesn't give you traits.
but i still cant fly
I'm on fire.
Nifty. Two guesses for two.
floats suck
thanks
yea it does
Sounds like a good way around it. Does that fix the issue?
i have now made a integer counter for the if statements
That *could* also be a float issue. It might actually end up being something like 0.499999, having the code consider it less than 0.5 and thus adding an extra 0.05, but round to look correct in the UI. Mostly just a guess, though.
well it still goes up to 0.55 for some reason
ok
well what works ?
Also, I'd change the `elseif total == 0.5 then` to a simple `else`, since floats tend to be inaccurate and you don't seem to *need* that specific number anyways.
It looks like you're updating every tick, though, so you'd be gaining the speed *very* fast.
lets see
I suspect so, at a glance.
FUCK YES ITS WORKING
so instead of adding 0,05 eacht ime just add total?
<@!124170727225163776> Throw your visual things in the <mod folder>/resources/gfx/etc. folders.
And if that's the case, subtracting from it is unnecessary.
do I just stick a gfx file in a folder?
How do I get my graphical mod to work
Admittedly I haven't touched regular stats, so I'm not fully knowledgable, but what I heard was that they are fully re-evaluated with every cache loop, making it so you only gain +0.05 at any one time. Wouldn't you want to add the `total`?
?
I'm trying to read through it, but I keep finding things to nitpick about that don't seem related to the issue.
no ideas? anyone ;_;
it's so weird
Hm. Not sure what the issue is, then
and i never get flying ability
it stops at 0.55 instead of 0.5
the total counter is still going up tho
i am getting a speed up just once
actually what's happening is: i can absolutely fire my limb tears
If I'm reading it correctly, yeah.
i do?
well it still doesnt work....
Also, the way this code is written, you'll always have flying no matter what
dunno, thought it might not work if i dont
Why are you updating it in almost every conceivable conditional instead of with the player definition?
Not really, it doesn't look like anything bad would happen because it's nil.
so creating it with a nil value is bad?
Well, not created, but it's updated in the shoot() function
of course it's updating
oh i'm ultra dumb
It's created in the shoot() function
You're assigning it to nil, and not updating it.
There is, actually
like in ur code
why?
there is no current_room
http://pastebin.com/Cbpi6w9U
trying
Either one works
Especially if it's a lot of code
Or hastebin
Maybe just throw it on pastebin (or your regional equivelant). That would be preferred.
dammit
Server/Internet issues, probably.
whys that?
yeah it is lol
I'm not seeing it. Sure it got sent? Is it red?
i posted it...
huh?
where is the code?
_looks around._
it's there ^^
<@174505132292046849> so, would u show us the code?
Show me the code, <@174505132292046849>.
Really? that's way more than I imagined
Yeah. If the wiki is to believed, Lump of Coal gives +6 damage at a standard room's width
i wanna give the player a speed up each time a specific custom tear is spawned, but it's only increasing it once
lump of coal adds damage based on how many tick the tear is on the screen
Maybe. It's a lot easier to claim power when you can see the actual numbers.
Also, I wouldn't say this is super powerful. Lump of Coal has about the same effect
That and bouncing tears.
right <@174505132292046849>
Right, yeah, soy milk. That would be insane, haha
oh
No, it's based on the tear speed
would anti gravity add damage even when the tear isn't moving?
Imagine it with Soy Milk
hey guys you would lov to help me find out why my code isn't working correct, right?
Yeah, balancing issues might happen
Youch, that's pretty strong.
for the last entity
The upper render text is the added damage
so
u said that speed adds damage
yeah
Always can make it work specifically
Accelerating tears?
Well, it doesn't, heh
I'm not sure what I'm looking at in that first video. Buncha debug info?
How does it work with Anti-Gravity?
And yes, don't give up
no, nothing sorry
Works kinda funny with tiny planet

Also, what about this item?
Now that itempools are fixed I can finally really start pumping out items. Hopefully I'll make an item pack people enjoy
I'd just like to finish a singular item. I've spent so many hours on one item and it still has bugs.
same
And most of them haven't even been released
I really need to make my own item pack. All I've done so far is make individual items
ok
lol
Now we just need an active item that does it. Get on it, <@223869207748542464>.
Rooms:
BOSS_3406 VIS SISTERS: changed spawn from 6,3 to 1,1
BOSS_3407 VIS SISTERS: changed spawn from 6,4 to 6,3
BOSS_3408 VIS SISTERS: changed spawn from 11,1 to 6,3
BOSS_3409 VIS SISTERS: changed spawn from 7,3 to 6,3
Can we say that Vis sisters is nerfed again?
So, item and trinket?
Champion Belt
Purple Heart is a trinket that literally just gives more champions
I think there's a passive item for that, at least.
That's a bit unreasonable.
There's already a trinket that makes more Champions, isn't there?
<@112975821186031616> yep
You could always just make a trinket that makes more Champions. Same difference. Outside the 'hard' rooms, but do you seriously expect to be able to change the entire terrain generation mid-game?
BTW, can somebody tweet Tyrone about if we can use animation nulls?
Like me
Yes, if they suck
do people play on Easy ?
<@112975821186031616> i just wanted to create a trinket that if picked up changes ur game difficulty to hard
thanks
Yes. There's a tutorial on the subreddit. https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5nifu1
*Mostly*, anyways.
does someone already know how to add itemes to itempools?
<@126590786945941504> Thanks for that ?
<@112975821186031616> Not only, it also includes stuff like `AddCallback`, `RegisterMod`, `LoadModData`, `WorldToRenderPosition`, `DebugString`
I can't imagine them letting you change the game's difficulty mid-game. That'd just get weird.
<@126590786945941504> yes, i tried
No idea how does it work with that
The Isaac namespace is basically a simplified front-end to other stuff. Albeit not very fleshed out.
`Game.Difficulty`, but it's a const
guys, is it even possible to change a game difficulty, like from normal to hard?
ok nice ty
I wonder why both of those exist.
<@120355885615808512> not that i could see
There's also `Isaac.GetChallenge()`
That would probably do it
One way might be `Game.Challenge` field
Yes, there is
So maybe there's a function for checking if you're on a challenge
There is a GetChallengeIdByName function
no bugs? ?
nice
you tested the items?
But I don't think mods can communicate with eachother at the moment.
<@120355885615808512> they're all really cool !
Best way would probably be to script it in lua.
Proooobably not. Yet.
Yeah, I tested it.
Ah, it needs ids at the moment.
so that you could have challenges that are compatible with other mods
Use the unpacker tool and look around in resources
I was wondering if you could define challenges through item name instead of item IDs
<@218390040928059392> Search for them as "shopkeepers"
I know how to define new challenges.
So, well, if you want, I could edit the anm2 to have another layer with a texture that you'll put the text on
I want to change shop "sellers" sprites but idk where are  or his name
`content/challenges.xml` is how you define new challenges. Starting items can be added there.
The only problem is that I don't think you can use nulls from Lua
Also, `resources/gfx/ui/ui_streak.anm2` has the text thingy
Nope, crashes the game
I'll try.
Hmm, no idea, just test it
aka without item IDs
...?
Is it possible to add items to challenges the same way you add items to itempools?
thanks ?
i just recently switched to discord from temaspeak ^^
how cool is that
oh my god
¯\_(?)_/¯
Appends it to the end of the message
It's /shrug in discord
erm
do you have that donger on a keybind or sth similar? xD
Thanks robobaby
Maybe it only autogenerates ids if it's in content or something? Because people have been reporting success when putting stuff into resources
¯\_(?)_/¯
ill try
i dont want a new, just replace one.
i thought its not possible to overwrite xml entries
i need an xml?
well. atleast it doenst work like with music or graphics
Like you've tried putting in a sounds.xml and the wav files?
Are you sure it isn't?
like, why?
im still pissed that it isnt possible to replace sounds
Okay thx i'll search and get you in touch if I fidn something ?
Not necessarily a pain
that would be a pain n the ass. but itll work
It'll be under the UI tho
¯\_(?)_/¯
You can create a sprite with the right stuff to draw
nop. doesnt exist
I mean
And i just need the text, i thought of a function like DisplayText("HelloWorld")
that might work too... god this hackiness which is necessary is fucking amazing ?
And run the pill? ¯\_(?)_/¯
Because i finally created a transformation
Maybe you could create a pill effect
And if you really want to mess around
but neither lets you specify a string
theres ShowFortune() and ShowRule()
But I think there might be a function for that
Well, it's certainly possible if you do it yourself, though it will be under the HUD
this is hardcoded for transformations
Id love to know! but i think this is not possible for now
Do you know how to display text on screen ? For example there is "Guppy" displayed when you transform
oh right i can destroy rocks xD
I don't know it :/
you're serious?
RNG:GetSeed() is always the same
what's the function to get the current seed of arun ?
Ah. Maybe when the documentation gets updated a little more, method'll be shown.
It's just hidden.
The Lost always has a half spirit heart
He might have some sort of exclusion to the shitty rule.
The only solution I could think of would be changing your character to the Lost
Yeah, I was making an item that replaced your HP with enemy HP and I came across that issue
Welp, that ruins that idea.
If you pick up an item, you die
Hearts don't display, either.
A character still lives with HP = 0.
Just don't give the character any hearts.
But that shows a single unfilled heart with a `?`
that would suck tho
umm, you could apply curse of the unknowns...
The Lost-like
on the HUD
i read tears nvm
no I mean
oh
entity.Visible?
Is there a way to hide hearts?
i bet 99% insults
id love to see the function desriptions of my older c++ projects
classic autogenerated descriptions ?
```
for Lua
```
<@220525353830055936> gotta love the method whose description is
np
i haven't tried yet, sorry :p
<@229593818691928067> how was the testing? ?
ah ok, well either way, you really should play some runs c:
I only started watching NL more often when Antibirth came out
Eh, most of it is from actually browsing the subreddit
i prefer to play the games myself =p
ahh, youre one of the NL fanboys ?
Most of my Isaac experience is from browsing the subreddit and watching NL
oo
I'm not sure if I've ever unlocked It Lives
you didnt even play afterbirth? Afterbirth was a great DLC imo! you really should play some runs ?
and yet I bought AB+
i haven't even played Afterbirth yet
its about time
ill play my first real round of AB+ now
i think
thanks
its ~=
`~=`
does lua have operator `!=`?
yeah, I shouldn't have started the argument in the first place. Apologies.
lol
there should be a #salt channel
guys everyday there's an argument about this
are there any original 2x2 error rooms in ab+?
?
Sorry for starting this argument
That's fair. You can view it however you like, I was just stating my view on your view.
you can view it however you like, you're the one who said I had no reason
we know they're willing to update the api, at least to the extent of adding in features which should have been complete 2 months into development
I'm just taking a more optimistic view, OK?
and it's much less shit now than it was on release
we know that they're willing to update the API
just be happy we have the feature now
okay, what are you accomplishing by giving nicalis a low bar to limbo under?
being salty accomplishes nothing though, it just makes you seem like someone who is never satisfied
^
I'm pretty Happy here
there's still plenty reason to be salty that it was not there on release
there's no reason to be salty about the feature not being there when it's here now
go figure
I'm really exited bout it
no patch notes
anyone have a link to patch notes?
Oh cool
be happy that the feature was added, the past's in the past
Cause it's pretty easy
it's an update
Or if no one found out
Not sure of it's because of an update
bravo, nicalis
yet another basic feature added that should've been in on release
cool, 9 days after release they add in the most critical feature
?
we can finally add items to item pools
YES
ill give it a try, thanks guys ^^
is save mod data and read mod data documented anywhere
yeah just tickle ed's taint a little, so to speak
and likes it
cause he already has seen it
"yo tyrone get on that shit"
and then ed might read it and be like
@ed and tyrone and then say like "hey any chance we could get the ability to teleport rooms in the api so I can make my pacman game a challenge run?" or however u fit that into 140 characters
well here's what I'd do
i highly doubt he reads all tweets, but ill try ^^
then if no response email nicalis
maybe just try tweeting him first?
whats the contact of tyrone?
good thinkin
thanks for that
f u c k  y e a
Yeah, just tested, they don't play this animation again.
I'll try it
o wait maybe they dont
lets see my boss img is rdy
Do they not play the "appear" animation every time you reenter the room?
the animation deosnt play when reentering the room, does it?
thats one good idae
hey
Maybe ```lua
entity:GetSprite():IsPlaying('Appear')
```
would work?
I need to check if it's the first time this pickup has spawned
Why do you need to check for its first frame?
but that'd be a lot of numbers
I wish there was a entity.FrameCount except continuous
damn
and save each seed for each room
RIP
probably
do i have to make a seperate table for each room?
and also if i do that
i guess i might just have to do that
indeed ?
yeah someone else suggested that but that would be so much WORK ;_;
<@93037421033177088> that would be a pain in the arse, but you could save every pickup that spawned in a table and check for that
I tried to change the bozo Mod, just change the animation done when we picks the item but my game crash..
or greed mode
i tried that but that means it wouldnt work for arcades if you leave and reenter
framecount == 1 and FirstVisit() or sth along the lines maybe?
hmm
can't do framecount == 1 cause that resets when you reenter the room
just trying to figure out how to do a check on pick ups to see if the frame they're currently in is their first time spawning
whats the prob?
now i have to figure out how to fix my own mod ;_;
it would be
that would be really cool if he did ?
that might be true. ill try
i bet if you made this a custom challenge ed would consider adding it to the game
you should email tyrone or somethin about that and see about getting that kind of thing added in
theres no way i can get into a custom room
but theres no command like "goto" in lua
id love to!
one of the challenge runs
like as in
are you gonna make this a challenge?
id say the difficulty is pretty good
you can also continue playing without problems without picking up the trophy
its a one number change in the code tho
yeah. i didnt know at which one i should spawn, so i just put it to 1
is the trophy supposed to spawn after level 1?
sweet ?
dunno what happened there
it works now
there we go
oke
ill try resubscribing
may restart rebirth? that sounds weird
it downloaded it im p certain
mod list*
it aint showin up in my mod folder either
is the mod enabled?
hmm
what. really?
Error changing room.
and type goto s.error.5000
open the console
you go into a game (pick judas)
how do i play it
same vid
yeah, that was mine ^^
is this the same one ed retweeted? looks like it
sweet ^^
yea it does
now this link should work for you
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840619486
there must be a way to check if a pickup has just spawned without doin all this list stuff
done
<@93037421033177088> that would be really cool! you would have to add me on steam though: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scayze/
EnableEntity and DisableEntity sound like they'd be so selectively useful
those descriptions are auto generated, i suppose that comment was some where misplaced in the code ^^
WHERE IS IT IF IT IS?
Is it an actual function?
yeah
The description
And suddenly http://i.imgur.com/AXfkt0L.png
wat
I was browsing the docs for oddities
GUYS
if u want
ill try it
i wrote the damn AI
i really cant say if the mod is too hard, too easy or anything
Does anyone want to playtest my PacMan mod?
its FriendsOnly, i should have expected that ^^
Is it private?
Or, wait, *may have been*
damn.
Nope, item has been removed by author
can anyone access the mod via that link?:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840619486
like that
oh
`;` is just a valid separator
...whut
`;` seem to outright be ignored, are they just considered a noop statement?
great
You don't need `;`, you don't need newlines, as long as you have whitespace between two instructions you should be fine
Yes
lua doesn't give much shits about (lack of) newlines, righr?
o wait i see what jean meant earlier by indexing the entities
I think other stats may affect your actual range but from what I've seen so far TearHeight is the only thing that actually modifies the stat
I think the other stats are also considered tho
yes
<@173380286183112705> By that you mean the stat, not actual range, right?
and cant see it
im lookin through the api
is there a way to check if in that frame a pickup has been dropped for the first time?
or if there's an unlisted option that
I know that <@110125570452398080>
on the mod uploader
yea just set it to private i think
is it possible to upload a mod that wont be seen publicy, but can be downloaded by people who get the link to it?
A tear delay of 10 means that the player shoots a tear every 10 frames
It subtracts from the player's MaxTearDelay, which increases the rate that the player spawns tears
it's TearHeight, which seems to linearly affect range
yep
Range isn't a real stat from what I know
Like with range
AKA the coat hanger modifies the teardelay, the tears up are calculated according to some formula
I think it's on the wiki, but I think it might be the other way around
what is the formula?
like, when you get Wire Coat Hanger, which is supposedly just a Tears Up, it obviously modifies the TearDelay according to some formula
<@173380286183112705> What's the question?
maybe
a lot of normal isaac items affect the Tears stat, which isn't the same as TearDelay
so I call them objects
dont make me rage, especially because idfk what rocks/poops/fires are
ffs
ok
An entity is an object
"an object"
there is an poop entity and an object
There's a poop entity and a poop grid entity
lol
alright, a question
and also check your log.txt
Try replacing `player.Velocity, player)` with `Vector(0,0), nil)`
Wait, is poop an entity and not a gridentity?
I said what u should do
No one what?
...
so... no one?
that was my idea why you would do it like that
¯\_(?)_/¯
right
Then I couldn't detect when you pick up coins
Can't do it like that
You have 50 coins and 50 of extraconsumable coins
copy the collectible effect of blue babys item
I'm fine with 99+12
you know what you could do
<@120355885615808512> Like I said, I can't change the displayed amount and the cutoff is at 50 by default, so it's 50+9
i need to just spawn any entity poop
e-coil I believe it was
from the turdy touch
but there is a poop entity too
there is an entity
yes I know that, but why 50+9? <@126590786945941504> 59 is fine too xD
You might want to look at the tile entities
I dont think Poop is an Entity
uhhh
<@120355885615808512> I can't change the displayed amount, so I just display the extra consumables after a +
not working
``Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_POOP, 0, 0,player.Position, player.Velocity,player)``
prolly object spawning
idk
how to spawn poop?
guys
hahahaha
that makes a lot of sense
just bought the fifth plague from the devil... no idea what it does xD
ah
Thats because the new items that get spawned have a FrameCount of 1
im drowning in hearts
lol
hearts everywhere
ok so it works but entity.FrameCount==1 does not - it's spawning an item every frame haha
rip
the number is the damn item ID ?
thanks
ah ok
zzz bad argument #1 to 'AddCostume' (Item expected, got number)
<@126590786945941504> why is my coin count 50 + 9?
<@93037421033177088> it's Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition
just tuning it up as we speak ?
thanks
nice work^^
you're the broken modem guy?
hmm
```[INFO] - [BrokenModem] Error in PostUpdate call: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/brokenmodem/main.lua:53: attempt to call a nil value (global 'GetFreeNearPosition')```
That means it would double them on first appearance, right?
```if (entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP) and entity.FrameCount == 1 then```
Like if I do
Do frame counts stay continuous even over rooms?
or something along those lines
Kilburn said he would work on the AB+ API if asked to
Alright, thank you a ton
the discussion is off topic here so i'll stop/move channel.
<@93037421033177088> yeah of course
Pretty much but people like to complain
I'd say the API is decent. Nicalis is going to improve it over time, and they might even be working with the Antibirth dev team to improve it
My loop uses the name "entity" so would I replace the "e"'s with "entity" instead?
thing is lua is capable of a lot more than this and i doubt nicalis will make it live up to its true potential.
Thank you Jean
at least as a scrub to lua, I've found it helpful
<@93037421033177088>  ` Isaac.Spawn(e.Type,e.Variant,e.SubType, GetFreeNearPosition(e.Position, 0), Vector(0, 0), nil)`
The API needs updating but it's getting there
oh my god my game laggs. lol probably all the mods
incapable of some very basic tasks.
the api is amazing isn't it.
LUL
Mod support
$6.66 for challenges, enemies, items, a final floor, modding tools etc
Theres this thing called
Its like you dont realize
you're forgetting there's more currencies.
there was more than enemies in the dlc tho
not expensive in dollars.
Each enemy cost $1.11 for fuck sake
So much money
Yes 6$ is very expensive
I payed $6.66 for 6 enemies.
To put it short
then for other entities make sure it's not in your list of references
is it meant to be a crappy dlc tho
Yeah but how do I double them? I'm p new to LUA
It sure is priced like one
???
Because its not supposed to be a big dlc
<@93037421033177088> you could look at the entities in room, double them then store their index/reference
Afterbirth+
It could be why its called
Hey I asked this last night but nobody was here: Anyone know how I'd go about doubling an item drop like Contract From Below does it?
?
Counting the greed doors and various hootenanny
afterbirth didn't even have 53
What the fuck and why
Afterbirth+ had 6
Afterbirth had 53(?) "New" Enemies.
For example, if I want a item to tranform me into Magdalene, what should I write? player:AddCostume.. ?
xD
or 6
5
no
15 items ? ?
thanks lol
xitems
right
ugh
it won't open on my browser and Steam won't let me install mods on browser so i have to load the page in the steam browser but Steam won't let me change the URL so i need to search for it by name
I posted the link ?
what's the name of your mod ?
thanks!
i'll test it <@120355885615808512>  ?
hey guys how do i change an EntityTear's damage ?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323
could someone test my mod? I seem to just ignore things that are not intended, but I already see as normal xD and I'm confused because I have a alpha version installed too
so if anyone has a bit of time, would appreciate  it very much!
?
shown by BetterDiscord
that are twitch emotes
Is `FailFish` another one of those shitty BetterDiscord emotes?
*sigh*
aka not the item it's supposed to be but on of mine FailFish
fuck some mod in the collection spawns the item in the starting room...
good enough
?
And brimbombs doesn't even have bomb sprite replacement :(
"all" AKA 2
just made a collection of a bunch of cool items ofc all the bombs of <@126590786945941504> are in ? first time we really can play isaac with modded items.. HYPE
lol
I can try it if you send me the costume :P
ye crashes mine too
like this? player:AddNullCostume(costumeHolding, -1)
i used second
well one makes them invisible and one crashes the game ?
i think
second one
Try both and see
yep
*sigh*
I'm trying to add one from a trinket pickup but can't tell if I should use AddCostume or AddNullCostume
anyone added custom costumes?
But some people prefer one way, some people prefer the other
And you can always make collections of single-item mods
It's not "better" either way
I'm wondering if it's better to upload single items or one mod for all
it's weird anyways
some parts are worse
some parts are better than my code
right, but the name
"it's on your legs and it's flaming and it leaves a trail of fire" isn't very unique
It's not exactly improbable
well. maybe he just got the same idea ^^
so the code seems different
wow
I'll download it and look into the code
I wrote a comment
But you'd have to check the workshop TOS, assuming he used your code or sprites
ah there
just message himand tell him to put the mod down
where is the report button
nice
okay
you mean
oh
rude?
Breaking your copyrights?
DOn't know how to say it
So unless the TOS specifies otherwise, he's actually uhh
Because by default stuff is copyrighted
It depends on the steam workshop TOS
Actually
that's just rude.. you don't do that
it's not tagged as remix or lists my mod or something
aslong as its not the same exact mod as someone elses, its allowed as far as i understood
and some other items
adds new stuff, in this case a new sprite
remix?
ofc he would call his item EXACTLY like mine
nah, but its a "remix" so its basicly allowed
sucks to be you
well
I already hate modding
and then when the other mod was created
when I added highheels
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323 look at the changelog
oh. yeah
with the flames spawning behind you
which one?
does anyone remember the video I posted a few days ago?
oh ok!
it works fine
someone said it's broken, idk
uhm... wtf.. could you look at this http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839756648&searchtext=
finally ?
woooo!
ability to add items to item pools
whats new?
heyho everyone, i saw theres an isaac update, what did i miss?
did I just kill myself?
I think it might be a few variations being repeated with cut out layers and sound effects applied at random
And it feels like you constantly hear new parts of it
The music's nice too
¯\_(?)_/¯
Now everything is back to normal
I think it's random, not 100% sure tho
Now the credits are shifting left and right with no special effects
Somebody put way too much work into it
This is beatiful ?
http://i.imgur.com/L14eMgf.png
Now the letters are pulsing and the title text is rainbow
If you let it loop, it starts going left and right with a motion blur http://i.imgur.com/vgw6Hs4.png
ohahahah
the dancing robot dude even got a spot in the credits http://i.imgur.com/gV1tbmS.png
yeah that was unexpected lol
<@112975821186031616> friction between 1 and 1.1 work
I just checked the about in the animation editor
oh god http://i.imgur.com/nk1jBIF.png
anyone have any experience with costumes not appearing? trying to add and remove 2 different ones but they're both invisible. Only appear sometimes :S
Anybody managed to figure out how to fix the MCI Device error?
Sooooo, uhh
the damage parameter in addburn and addpoison does nothing right?
Maybe they accelerate to an invalid velocity or move to an invalid position or something, who knows.
Apparently giving things absurd amounts of friction can crash the game.
*Why would it?*
Know any mobs with really high friction? I'd like to make sure my friction modifier doesn't end up crashing people.
Holy workaround, Batman.
`EntityPlayer:TryUseKey()`
dude
lol
Yay, solved my issue with using one-use items crashing the game! All I had to do is replace the current active item with the required one-use item and then use ? card on it.
I know there's something about sprites and sounds in the animation editor
You can attach sounds to sprites?
I guess I'll try with a sprite then
eh
<@109624258317033472> said you need a npc for it
Don't tell me I'll have to create a sprite with a sound
How do you play sounds in general? *There is a way, right?*
I need to mess with custom sounds
That reminds me
if there would be a way to disable it..
?
Then go ahead, bask in the glory of a thousand sound effects
I prefer not doing that
lol
Although that won't work well with hud offset
Draw the bar yourself
Like I said
Well
so any other ideas ?
yea
but
I mean it works
xD
I've heard legends of the sound
not even annoying sound effect
oh god
did this
      player:SetActiveCharge(player:GetActiveCharge()+1)
That's about it
LOL
Sharp Straw is 300
Brown Nugget is 250
Not Butter Bean is 300
brimstone takes about 30 ticks to fire so 110 doesn't sound wrong for most items
Glass cannon 110
Boomerang is 70
Though butter bean is 90
then they can just add 1 per update
yeah that would have been my next guess
Or they just wanted a consistent big number
Probably takes 110 ticks or something
I was just wondering why of all numbers they picked 110
Hm, I wonder if that's what overlays are for
Empty and full are opaque
Empty has shadow
As you can see

And <@154701703474577408> It's like 32 pixels tall
But hey, that's just an educated guess
And the cutoff full can be, well, practically anything, because it's cutoff at runtime
draw empty, draw cutoff full, draw overlay
So I'd assume it renders like
The only green is the full bar animation
the 3 charges overlay has no green
is it 110 pixels tall?
Because, you see
yea
and it renders differently in code
No, 110 must just go for 1 or custom rendering
maybe just the 1 is used
and 110 as it seems
Along with empty and full chargebar textures
There's only 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 charges overlays
Looking at `ui_chargebar.anm2`
and add them in specific times
I see they use the 110 charges as visuals
Yeah, cooldown doesn't work for me either.
it's litterally a 110 charges item
lol
And it's just it renders
but it isn't reaload either
It's just that it's too dense for the bars to be there
but visually
wanted to say that I didn't tested that
yea
No it doesn't, try completing a room with it
...what
maxcharges="110" makes it a 1 room charge
I know
Did `cooldown` work?
`<active achievement="59" description="Reusable flames" gfx="Collectibles_164_BlueCandle.png" id="164" maxcharges="110" name="The Candle" />` is what the game's items.xml has
just a one charge item
I did
Go try what alz said
¯\_(?)_/¯
If it works, I guess.
I believe it was `maxcharges="110" cooldown="<time in ticks>"`
IIRC the red candle has, like, 110 active charge set, but that doesn't work for modded items
And, well, drawing the green bar yourself
Then you can draw it by cutting off the excess with the second argument to `Sprite:Render`
You can create an item with no charge and check with Update how many ticks passed
But if you're willing to handle it yourself
Not sure if there's an official way
can I make active items that recharge in rooms with enemies like red candle?
hm
oh okay
The animation isn't built into the costume
No, I mean
a white flash
Infamy has no animation for the damage blocking
huh
I'd try with damage callback if tear then sometimes return true
Well, have you tried adding the effect?
or just add the effect xD?
can I somehow show the Infamy animation of blocking tears?
I'll see
no idea why it even would crash ?
Does anyone know how to make the game not crash when you `EntityPlayer:UseActiveItem()` a one-use item (like Diplopia)?
i'm just making an item give a bonus to when they pick consumables up
and maybe check if maxhealth didn't change to ignore health ups
you execute your stuff when isaacs health is 2? more than last update
yes
I know there is no call back for it, so its only update right?
Hey, is anyone able to point me in the right direction for checking when the player picks up a heart?
<@126590786945941504> so anyways maybe got another idea?
and the workshop will be 99% "op tears up and damage item"
yes it will be terrible
Though I haven't been following progress, so I can't say anything actual about the project, but that's how it often turns out
And then you have a program where a whole bunch of people get to show what they don't understand about Lua
I mean I could use it for code generating, because I'm too lazy typing the same stuff every item xD
Because people who don't need them prefer to just make the items
Most of the time the people who work on those kinds of programs are people who could use those kinds of programs
I doubt the generated code will be good
no reason to get rude though
it's sure hard
Yes, I expect that'll be a sad day for modding
I answered a lot of question here to people, including some of them
or something
I know a lot of kids are here trying to get a ItemMaker program
Including a person who gave me an equation to calculate the radius of a square
Well, I don't know you and I've talked to various people
I'm not dumb or something wtf
removed the red creep at the start
this creep.Color = Color(0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
the gif shows the creep PRE-FIX
"No it doesn't work look the creep isn't there it's supposed to be invisible"
It genuinely looks like it
Where you think the creep got removed because you set it as invisible
what
I'm not sure if you're having a problem
?
This looks like the biggest derp in a while
it fixed this
I'm sorry, but
no
Do you mean "doesn't instantly remove the red creep"?
And by "removes the red creep at the start"
look at this https://gfycat.com/HandmadeQuarrelsomeAfricanmolesnake
yes
...what
because it removes the red creep at the start
set color doesn't work in this case
any way to make entities invisible?
hm
that's what I thought how it would work
k got it
FailFish
right
oh
The comments describing how to do it
what I could find there
I don't understand
what
I'd read enums.lua :P
and how do I disable damage?
hm no bad idea
I guess you could just add damaging creep instead/too ¯\_(?)_/¯
hmmm
but I cannot do it this way if it's not dealing damage..
no
I'm sorry, but are you complaining that `SLIPPERY` doesn't deal damage?
I mean
it's CREEP_SLIPPERY_BROWN
the creep isn't dealing any damage
Use NPC_DAMAGE, stop the damage from occuring if the familiar is the damage dealer and apply the effect instead?
<@126590786945941504> I want to addconfusion
https://hastebin.com/porehuqade.lua
What do you need to do on collision (and with what?)
<@120355885615808512> "t.CollisionDamage = 2.5"
I think so
so I cannot do something on collision right?
cool
the bit commented with -- gets rid of something weird the creep does on frame 1 ?
Can you send me your code on hastbin just so I can read it for tomorrow when I start making one
https://hastebin.com/
not possible right?
now I need collision lol
what bit did you insert for future refrence
yea
no red anymore
wait so it works?
sad though we cannot change the color of it then...
nice
yes does work
?
> nice api^^
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840418645
thank you ?
Hmm
hm okay
^^
I was looking through familiar mods
not white, but invisible
where did you get this?
Here:
https://hastebin.com/porehuqade.lua
This is not my mod but it makes the color of the trail white to stop that red effect
Hold on wait
hm
<@120355885615808512> Make the color of it brown
maybe `e:ClearEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_APPEAR)`
at least I found out I could use subtype for seconds to stay
?
nice api^^
not my fault ```lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT,EffectVariant.CREEP_SLIPPERY_BROWN,10,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)```
well you're probably changing the creep type after it's first rendered with the default
looks so weird
anyone an idea why there's red creep first
https://gfycat.com/HandmadeQuarrelsomeAfricanmolesnake
it's weird
No It Isint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3BeFO3YVzw
Is this video english?
I don't maybe it has to do something with the animations, I didn't make them... and the game crashes when I try to apply a costume and the custom cards aren't shown either
oh okay damn :/
<@120355885615808512> no i dont realy know anything about it. i ony know things in therms of pre ab+ things
does anyone need a sprite idea for a character in a mod?
<@195368190333812736> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m2s14/afterbirth_animation_editor_tutorial/?ref=search_posts
and
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/377a9h/animations_explained/?ref=search_posts
could help you further
<@!174193097285173250> uhm you know how to use costumes right?
Yeah I have no idea all I found out was the About tab is fucking awesome
<@195368190333812736> its pretty ´function heavy but once you know what you have / want to do, its good to use ?
and how can I make the creep last longer
that looks very ugly
but at the start for a short time it's red
I'm spawning brown creep
I'm spawning the creep
weird
hm
Is the animation editor easy to use?
And control it with the familiar callbacks
Then you spawn that entity with Isaac.Spawn
But, well, you create an entities2.xml with an entity with id="3"
yes
femiliars?
Is that like feminist isaac propaganda?
How does one make a femiliar
oh ok
Especially since there's `EntityEffect:IsPlayerCreep`
okay
It's an effect AFAIK
there a multiple
I mostly hate curse of the blind and curse of the darkness
does anyone know what entity type creep is?
xD
XBagon, I wouldn't mind curses if they were actually curses and not nuisances
but that makes sense I guess
oh, I was thinking it would stay
Right?
I prefer curses
Stats down for the floor, that is
the trinket absorbs the curse at the cost of a part of your "soul"/body, aka stats
stats down?
stats down stays
Does the curse go back, does the stats down stay?
Go down one floor, get curse removed, drop trinket
There's only one problem
then it's super good
or that
but when it hits
I meant for every curse one
minor stats down
Or, just, y'know
Maybe damage the players black or soul hearts
like it blocks the curse but you take some damage or something
that would be better than the black candle
yeah , but not a good thing
like 2 black hearts
what if it blocks a curse but you
How's my idea?
you get something else
and when it blocks a curse
true
Each one? That seems like a low chance it would be useful if you get each one
That would be neat
maybe a trinket for each curse?
remove curses, they're just annoying
Opening secret rooms grants 1 level of map reveal(first treasure map, second is compass)? Idk tried smth creative
and after 3 times it get's destroyed?
Holy Mantle in trinket form?
Anyone got some ideas for trinkets?
somebody told me nvm
Updated brimbombs and rockbombs on steam and moddingofisaac to include them in the item pools.
do any of u know where to put afterbirth mods in afterbirth?
hello
how do you do that
I mean trinkets can spawn after you cleared a room
you can put them in
They are in chest pools
I really doubt trinkets are in itempools.. that wouldn't make any sense
wow 43,400 Gold Chests and the game doesn't crash. But 360 Ultra Greeds do
so.
oh wait, bum friend doesn't drop items at all
Is it not the same as the beggar pool?
is the bum friend pool in the unpacked itempools.xml?
doubt it
Is there a way to add trinkets to the Bum Friend pool?
its so glitchy
fuck the animation editor
I'd think so, I can try if *somebody* gives me the costume image
a costume for an item?
costume like?
anyone added a costume?
ahh alright thanks :3
Just remember that you can only save strings, so you'll have to serialize the data somehow, either by managing to store everything directly in the string, using custom code or waiting for `require` so that you can use json
oh
so you can manually build in the character progression
from the mod
you can save data
does that mean progression in that character will never happen? lol
crap i made a custom character if achievements are locked
Thank you !
I see
and a weight of 0.5 would make it as rare as lil brimstone
so a weight of 9000 would make your item show more than other items
the highest the most common
the lowest the rarest
weight is the value that determines how rare an item is
<@81035468866584576> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5nifu1/item_pools_are_now_available_a_guide_to/
5.100.id
btw in the itempools.xml what the ``Weight=`` value for ?
spawn code for an item pedestal?
alright works now
Well, with the item pool now ?
How to add a trinket to the normal chest pool?
Let's see
like other trinkets
randomly
no I mean I want it to drop in the run
spawn trinketid
you can spawn it with the console
or how I can make mine spawn
LUL
HAHAHHH
so noone has an idea how trinkets spawn?
I'm picking the character that starts with the item
just realized
But that's less fun
Or, I guess you could use the `combo` command
just increase the weight
Walk in the middle, will take off all your bombs at once
or
`giveitem Pyro`
`repeat 200`
`spawn Bomb Bum`
And if you want to test it well
try building y our xml in order too
^
No, it might log with a problem though
oh does it log when the item is added to the pool
Check your log then
i placed it on resources and works
alongside costumes2, entities2, items, players, and preload
content
Where did you put that xml?
damn was hoping this program would just quote my previous message
EatMeReturns - Today at 3:27 AM
I can't get my bomb bum item pool to work
itempools.xml:
<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="bombBum">
        <Item DecreaseBy="0.5" Name="Earthbending" RemoveOn="0.1" Weight="1" />
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>
<@!95444500364660736> talking about natural spawning
mind showing it
made an xml file
are you using the tool or making an xml?
custom item, bomb bum
what is your item and which pool are you working on?
and if it's *really* op, like mega blast, do like 0.2 0.2 0.1
sure haven't yet
<@120355885615808512>  If you're talking about the console, it's `spawn tTRINKET_ID`.
if your item is op, do weight 0.5
If your item isn't great, do decreaseby 0.5
Alright
<@116386733905412105> did you get your pool to work?
I would say for almost all items do weight 1, decreaseby 1, and removeon 0.1
ahh okay. Also what do you recomend the numbers should be for a libary item? Just 1 and 0.1? <@134478547795443712>
lol
now that is a question
how do trinkets spawn? ?
and as for testing...I wouldn't. It's very difficult to do so for non-beggar pools
it's rare but it exists
greedLibrary is the library secret room in greed mode
Also what is greedLibary
how am I suppost to test a Libary Pool item?
Maybe it went below the remove threshold
Just try again
```xml
<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="bombBum">
        <Item Name="Rock Bombs" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>```
what is your itempools.xml?
Yes
but did YOUR item spawn?
holy fuck, they all just shot out in every diection at once and spawned items all over the room
itempools.xml:
```<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="bombBum">
        <Item DecreaseBy="0.5" Name="Earthbending" RemoveOn="0.1" Weight="1" />
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>```
I can't get my bomb bum item pool to work

okay so
aww yeah item pools work Kreygasm

yeah there's a thread about it
`MC_POST_CURSE_EVAL = 12`
oh, there's a new callback
oh neat.
Check your autocompletes
`spawn Bomb Beggar`?

anybody know how to spawn a bombbum

what's the item that gives 99 bombs
You have access to everything you had without mods enabled, but you can't unlock new stuff
Achievement unlocking != game progress reading
No
since achievement are disabled, do we only have access to the base set of items while playing our mods?
more importantly
ok well w.e.
I have yet to see one with greater than 1
on no decrase at all
most items are 1, some are 0.5, very few are less than that
that depends on what you want it to do
so we want to have very little removeon value ?
only the rarer or "special" or whatever items reduce it by a significant amount
most of the items reduce the value by very little
But it took a good 30+ items before I started rolling mostly breakfasts
In greed mode once I got blank card two of diamonds, and bought out every item in the sho
It's probably a lot.
I have no idea what each pool starts at.
if I get my first custom item, the pool will go down to 4.5, thereby removing my other custom item from the pool
let's say my other custom item is removeon 4.8
Can we know what value the pool starts at?
let's say my custom item is 0.5
each item reduces this by a value
ah...
let's say 5
the pool starts at a value
no
Yeah, that's where the term "breakfast yourself" comes from :D
The way you worded it, after one item you'll just get breakfast with decreaseby?
it's breakfast
at least I think it's breakfast. it's one of the generic +1 max health items
if a pool is so low that all of the items have been removed, it will only spawn breakfast
this functionality makes it so you can't just randomly get all of the super amazing items from a pool
removeon is how low the pool's value counter has to be in order to remove the item from the pool
decreaseby is how much the pool's value counter is decreased by when the item is picked up
that way you can make some items rarer than others
weight is likelihood to be selected from the pool
Now, would anybody know what exactly are the `Weight`, `DecreaseBy` and `RemoveOn`?
`<passive cache="all" description="Blood laser barrage" devilprice="2" gfx="Collectibles_118_Brimstone.png" id="118" name="Brimstone" special="true" />`
The prices are in items.xml
or is it automatically 1
How do you set devil deal prices?
still no Entity:ToTear()

I saw example mods on Steam and their creator said that it doesn't work now, but will work after the update on January 11th. Few hours later the game updated.
I saw it on reddit
It was kind of a secret update
I wondered about that, too.
Wait where did you guys get info about the update?
only changed it for treasure room items
?
ty
instead of name
also you have Item Id=
no
is that the full contents of your file?
this doesn't work somehow ```lua
<Pool Name="shop">
        <Item Id="Combo Breaker" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>```
Finally
yep
<@134478547795443712> ^^
Wait can we add items to pools now?
Thanks!
item pool names:
- "treasure"
- "shop"
- "boss"
- "devil"
- "angel"
- "secret"

<@195368190333812736> Cool idea, I like it
New trinket I made:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840381377
but for mods
ok not in the game because those are hardcoded to certain ID's
YES ITEM POOLS
<Item DecreaseBy="1" Id="8" RemoveOn="0.1" Weight="1" />
in the vanilla files it isn't
but yes
That's been the case for every item
nice
so instead of id we just can set the name
found this, filename is itempools.xml, goes in the same folder as items.xml
```
<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="devil">
        <Item Name="Pyrokinesis" Weight="10" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool>
</ItemPools>
```
okay ty ?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835650828
where?
I don't know. Just look at Nicalis' example mods.
where is the changelog?
How do you do item pools now
ITEM POOLS ?
https://youtu.be/xycRCykPv2w
I feel like this song altered a bit could fit the secret room
Also item pools and shaders I think.
so the only new thing in the api are curses?
?
Item pools work now'
There's a way to add a baby ?
post player effect update
lol yeah
Oh my god. I just noticed that it's not POST\_PERFECT\_UPDATE, but POST\_PE**F**FECT\_UPDATE.
Nevermind, I can't explain it.
You're talking about them being pushed by other stuff when on the ground, right?
...hitboxes?
Is there a way to find out consumables' hitboxes?
Oh wait, not for picking up, nvm, I was thinking about ```lua
ActionTriggers = {
    ACTIONTRIGGER_NONE = 0,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_BOMBPLACED = 1,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_MOVED = 1 << 1,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_SHOOTING = 1 << 2,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_CARDPILLUSED = 1 << 3,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_ITEMACTIVATED = 1 << 4,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_ITEMSDROPPED = 1 << 5
}```
Not a callback, **but**
*Actually*
But there still is no callback for picking up items or consumables.
pocketitems.xml
Yes.
Can you add new cards to the game yet?
Alright Ill look it to it that should kick start me in the right direction
EntityFamiliar and EntityEffect should do it?
Anyone know how to make a Femiliar with a creep?
also does anyone know what the most recent patch was?
does that mean you can only get the base unlocked items?
so since achievements are disabled
it doesnt do player init every floor
just try ^^
im still a noob
actually a doubt it would else you would lose all items at the start of each floor
dont know
hmm, but dosent it initilize the player at the start of each floor?
post_player_init i would say
ugh that sucks, what callback would I use?
yep
through Lua?
give the player the item on game start
dose anyone know if its possible to have a charector start with a custom item?
what avant garde spellings
Can you give the player a femiliar without the fimiliar showing up?
not like you cared in the first place ?
nvm im just stupid
Can someone give me a template to make a Trail/Creep? Because I want to make a item that every 30 second it changes the Trail/Creep to a diffrent one
so now, i need to make it asap
like that is my item!
wtf
dude
lil'nothernlion
uh. i don't get it

OH NO
time to fix my entire mods
eyy
time to fix POCKET DEVIL DEAL!
Oh, i saw item pools was added to api!
Say i heard something about a EntityTear class but i couldn't find in the documentation?
thanks for nothing then
tyrone and ed haven't tweeted it yet either
nope
do we have update notes?
But I don't know what.
There must be something wrong with the code.
I tried debugging a different mod before, and it wouldn't load either.
xd
lol
are you sure it's talking about your file?
Isaac just updated, it could have broken some other mod :P
well shit
My code is only 27 lines long.
where's line 35
Debugging suspended at 'resources/scripts/main.lua:35' (couldn't activate the file).
Okay, it should work now.
No.
do you have --luadebug on launch options
I did that but the string still doesn't show up.
you also have to add StartDebug() to the code
to see the number of items in the table
try and Isaac.DebugString(table.getn(entity))
hmm
It's not storing in the table properly.
hmm
But it's not nil?
Error in PostUpdate call: ...ing of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/binding of steven/main.lua:17: nil passed to reference
[INFO]
Yes.
but desappear when u exit the room?
they spawn
The enemies won't respawn when I go into a new room though.
i'm pretty sure arrays in lua start at 1 yeah
oh wait n = 0
you should put n = n+1 at the end
Is this code better?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Binding of Steven",1)
local room
local n = 0
local entity = {}
function mod:spawnStevens()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  n = n + 1
  entity[n] = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
  entity[n]:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
  entity[n]:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
end
function mod:respawnStevens()
  if Game():GetRoom() ~= room then
    if n > 0 then
      for i=1,n do
          entity[i] = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
          entity[i]:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
          entity[i]:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
        end
      end
      room = Game():GetRoom()
    end
  end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.spawnStevens, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.respawnStevens)
```
ok xd
oh nvm I can borrow inspiration from that code just posted
how do I clear an active item after leaving the room it activates in?
yes
Oh, so should I put that outside the function?
it clears entities every tipe the function runs
local entity = {}
What's wrong with this code?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Binding of Steven",1)
local room
local n = 0
function mod:spawnStevens()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  local entity = {}
  n = n + 1
  entity[n] = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
  entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
  entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
end
function mod:respawnStevens()
  if Game():GetRoom() ~= room then
    if n > 0 then
      for 1,n do
          local entity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
          entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
          entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
        end
      end
      room = Game():GetRoom()
    end
  end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.spawnStevens, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.respawnStevens)
```
i prefer tables though
works either way
Oh, a table instead of an array?
check the tutorial
I have this so far.
>http://lua-users.org/wiki/TablesTutorial
How do I keep adding to the array?
sice you can do table.getn(charmedEntities) to get the length of the array
it also doubles as numberOfCharmed
yeah
So should I create an array with all the charmed enemies?
Again, i am pretty sure you cannot compare Room objects, you need to get the roomindex, i had problems myself with my mod
then just remove from array
Oh, thanks.
returns boolean
entity:IsDead()
<@266032468853915650> How?
yes
so if you have a multiplayer baby, you can make the item effect them too
Because it will respawn ones that died in the previous room.
That makes sense
Ahhhh
<@266032468853915650> Is there any way to tell if my charmed enemies died or not?
peffect_update is called for every *player* every frame
update is called every frame
the difference between update and peffect_update is for multiplayer
oh
Hmm ok
I'm not sure if it is actually called at a different time or if this is just for the sake of neatness
but I think you're supposed to put item code in peffect_update
to be honest I don't really know the difference between "update" and "peffect_update"
I dont think you can compare Rooms like that
```local room = nil

function myThing:check()
  if Game():GetRoom() ~= room then
    --Do things here
    room = Game():GetRoom()
  end
end``` <@!182509747835109387>
Ahh ok
Btw could someonr explain me when post_peffect is triggered?
games usually render many more times per second than they update
there is a different rendering and update loop so that the speed of the game does not change alongside your framerate if your hardware is poor :P
Ok thank you really much :)
so it doesnt render the tear
post render is for drawing
post update
i didnt ask for the code, i'm making some now lol
Would i do that on post_render or post_update callback?
I want the second function to occur whenever Isaac changes rooms.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Binding of Steven",1)
local numberOfCharmed = 0
function mod:spawnStevens()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  local entity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
  entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
  entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
  numberOfCharmed = numberOfCharmed + 1
end
function mod:respawnStevens()
  for 1,numberOfCharmed do
      local entity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
      entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_CHARM)
      entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
    end
  end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.spawnStevens, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.respawnStevens)
```
hmmyea kinda
Ahh, so i could iterate through room entites and on every player tear randomly update it
let me get some code going <@!182509747835109387>
like
I tried it before, but it didn't work.
Has anyone figured out how to trigger an event whenever the player changes rooms?
so you want to check if a entity tear that was created my the player and has a small lifetime and then delete it and fire a tearvariant that you want
ok
<@266032468853915650> i don't get how i would use that function to change the tears im firing, could you help?
^
I can just set local for the whole sheet.
Oh, I don't need a global variable.
Then, it respawns them every room.
The Friendly Ball enemies work by adding both the charmed and friendly effects to them enemies.
well ok then
So I can keep track of my charmed enemies.
why would you need one?
I guess one is okay.
But how would i use these above my other tears?
Which is a big no-no for mods
I need a global variable though.
OH I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
it will have a chance of 1 in 2 to spawn a tear
But thats very limited and not so nice
```if math.random(2) == 1 then
    player:FireTear(...)
end```
At the moment i randimly spawn additional custom tears while shooting
well
Not necessarily
like, based on luck?
I swear my most common cause of errors is "failure to write then after an if statement"
dunno lol
Yes, how do I do that?
charmed enemies as in ones from the friendly ball <@!182509747835109387>
Hey could someone here tell me a good way of making random tear alterations, like tough love's for example?
No, charmed enemies can hurt you.
friendly enemies are like the black flies
those are *charmed* enemies
And they stay between rooms.
And they can usually attack enemies.
On friendly enemies, there's typically the hearts above the enemies.
btw FLAG_FRIENDLY only makes them not aggro on you
and what do you mean there are no hearts
because isaac clears the entities on a room
Why?
well ofc they do
And they disappear when I leave the room.
Help me
And there's no hearts.
It works, but it can't attack enemies.
maybe
```lua
function mod:spawnStevens()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  local entity = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GAPER,1,0,pos,Vector(0,0),nil)
  entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
end
```
Like this?
try it out
it runs
There's no way to run it.
But that's just assigning it to a variable.
and maybe add it to an array?
you can do local entity = Isaac.Spanw(...)
hmm
Can you keep track of which enemies you spawn and which are on screen?
How would you add the flag though?
it doesnt seem to be a status effect so the only option I can think of is by adding the flag :/
<@266032468853915650> Did you figure it out?
The status effect of the enemy should be the subtype in Spawn.
Nope, it doesn't work.
I'll try it out.
```lua
entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlags.FLAG_FRIENDLY)
```
Maybe this?
1 sec i think i saw something on the docs
I just don't know how to call it.
I know the flag is FLAG_FRIENDLY.
Yeah
The ones the Friendly Ball spawns
yeah like the pokeyball item
Well, not charmed
Charmed
as in charmed or the one that has a happy face?
I don't know how to use the flags for entities.
Now how do I make it a friendly Gaper?
oh well I know my costume will work if they ever *do* implement alt colours, so I will just leave it and see if it is fixed later
It works.
try it out
Yeah, I know that, but do I just put 1 instead of 0 for the variant argument?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityId, Variant, Subtype, Position, Velocity, Parent)
<@266032468853915650> thanks for the suggestion, but I have *costumes* working
I just don't have *altcolours* working
How do you access the variants?
maybe another variant?
Is there any way currently to spawn a normal Gaper? Spawning a Gaper seems to always spawn a Frowning Gaper.
<@266032468853915650> I'll give it a look but I am guessing it might not be
log file tells me "Failed to load costume alt color spritesheet gfx/characters/costumes/costume_511_monstro_red.png!"
but if I paste it into the game's characters/costumes folder instead of my mod one it works
check my mod "Snappy The Tortoise" and see if that's what you want
hmm
:(
not the mod one
well I've been trying to set a custom costume that will change colour when the player does (like the smb super fan costume) and it turns out that while you can put hasSkinAlt="true" in your costumes.xml, it only looks for them in the game directory
you know how you can set custom costumes
hey guys
time fo fix all my mods
holy shit
wow, yet another basic feature added that should've been in on release
Yay, update! Item pools!
or if there is I haven't found it
So there's nothing to do about it now?
there's no place to insert the ui graphics
Because the ui disappears when you select a new character.
Does anybody know where the graphics to add a new character goes?
oh I hadn't declared player yet, lol
so far they don't seem to be possible
hmm. any good itempool mods for ab+?
https://hastebin.com/caloxapehe.php
this applies an item successfully when I restart a run, but not when I start a run
when exacrtly is POST_PLAYER_INIT called?
Anyone know how I would go about doubling a pick up drop? Like how contract from below does it.
not a bad idea
For musical peeps
We should make a music channel
oh good
nice
I assume, I've yet to see the items in any pools yet though
so they're getable
is that the ability to actually add our items to the pools then?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840307113
link?
ooh this is interesting, there's a nicalis example mod for itempools on the workshop. I don't think they're working at the moment, but update soon maybe?
I figure that this is going to be something the API can't do, but does anyone know how to designate different skin colour version of characters?
Issac/Maggy etc will automatically shift between the 001_isaac, 001_isaac_black, 001_isaac_blue, etc spritesheets without any apparent entry in xml but simply putting similarly named sheets in a new character's folder doesn't work
obviously Isaac.Spawn with ENTITY_PROJECTILE but how do I copy all of the attributes over while changin the height?
Since you apparently can't edit a projectile's attributes once spawned what if I just removed the old projectile and spawned a new one with the exact same attributes except a different height?
How would I go about creating a new projectile?
never mind i had them the wrong way around
dose the souce have to be  entityref?

[INFO] - [The Inferno] Error in PostUseItem call: ...ding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/inferno mod file/main.lua:9: attempt to call a nil value (method 'AddBurn')
hmm
```function Boomandburn(entity)
    local whattohit = EntityRef(entity);
        --Isaac.Explode(entity.Position, entity, 40.0);
        --entity:TakeDamage(40, DamageFlag.DAMAGE_EXPLOSION, whattohit, 30);
            --if entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then

            --end
    end```
exatcly
it doesn't return anything
why does AddBurn() returen a nil value -.-
alas Brimstone doesn't work as a TemporaryEffect, it was worth a try though
ah it's player:GetEffects()
how do I use TemporaryEffects?
how do I use TemporaryEffects?
but just doesnt
it feels like fallingspeed modifier should work
i have a feeling the api just doesnt allow it
indeed
Now we just need to find a way to edit enemy tear falling speed.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Alright I messed around with the get data stuff and got it to work
at least i've never seen any new entity have any data in it
Oh.
it wouldn't have any bearing on the tear's actual fallingspeed since it appears to be a table specifically for user defined information
<@135254843567767552> Could you do entity:GetData().FallingSpeed = 0?
in other words, you can't write `entity.TearVelocity = 0` but you can write `entity:GetData().TearVelocity = 0`
i think i get it
i used entity:GetData() to receive that entities personal table that can be affected and stored their initial velocity there, then used it to restore their velocity later
basically the api is giving us "userdata" objects which are created by the api designers, we can't add new properties and such onto them. they exposed the function called GetData() which returns their own personal lua table that you _can_ write to.
is that what you mean?
Is initial velocity a thing that entities have?
oh wait
What is it?
haha
i dont know what that is
the main reason is
the api gives each entity a data table though, any reason you don't want to use it?
using the loop index shouldn't work properly since entities won't necessarily disappear in the same order they appeared and i'm not sure there's a guarantee the list is sorted anyway
(yea i know it's a bit weird to be using framecount but it works nicely when im freezing enemies so i just kept using it here)
```
                if (entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE) and (entity.FrameCount % math.random(2,5) == 0) then
                    entity.Velocity = TearVelocity[i]
                end
```
```
                if (entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE) and (entity.FrameCount % math.random(2,5) == 0) then
                    entity.Velocity = TearVelocity[i]
                end
```
errors*
and i get no bugs
hmm after doing what you guys said the tears now stop but wont restart moving
it's a shame projectiles dont just have all the stuff regular isaac tears do
and yeah without a Projectile or ToTear() i'm not sure that enemy tears can be frozen / stalled from falling unless you replace them over and over again maybe
But remember to clear it after you loop through everything.
Yeah.
i assume at the top or it will just be emptied each time
should i declare it at the top or within the update loop
TearVelocity could be anything
Just try declaring the variable.
```lua
if entity:GetData().initialVelocity == nil then
    entity:GetData().initialVelocity = entity.Velocity
end
if entity.FrameCount % 4 == 0 then
    entity.Velocity = entity:GetData().initialVelocity
else
    entity.Velocity = Vector(0,0)
end```

https://files.catbox.moe/zznxuc.mp4
im not trying to
Unfortunately, I don't think there's a way to get an EntityTear from an Entity
You guys have to remember I am quite new to this programmin stuff so when I'm making obvious mistakes that's why haha ?
<@93037421033177088> local TearVelocity = {}
TearVelocity was just a name I made up
It's his own variable.
I thought I was making my own
EntityTear does though
Entities don't have a TearVelocity variable
...
do I  need to declare it first
or use GetData() though
[INFO] - [BrokenModem] Error in PostUpdate call: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/brokenmodem/main.lua:36: attempt to index a nil value (global 'TearVelocity')
Yeah, I think so.
as simple as that?
entity.Velocity = TearVelocity[i]
and then when i want to unfreeze
?
TearVelocity[i] = entity.Velocity
Yes.
using [i] or something?
so like
So you can call both in a for loop.
Just give them the same index as the entity.
of how it works
im having trouble visualising it in my head
So I make an array but then how does each tear know which velocity was it's original one from the array? they dont necessarily freeze and unfreeze in the same order
thanks
can't forget the then
then
if math.random(chancenumberhere) == 1
<@154701703474577408> math.random() if you don't care about it being seeded.
but i'm working on item expansion pack 1 now
math.random i think
it's green
simple question I'm sure somsone can answer:
best method for generating a random number for "chance every x" effects?
<@266032468853915650> How is green Isaac going?
make an array and fill it in when the tears stop and then add the velocity when its time to unfreeze
i just dont fully understand lua yet so basic stuff like this is messin me up
but no
i figured entity.TearVelocity = entity.Velocity was the way to go about it
```for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do```
and since my loop is like
but i need to store a different one for each tear in the room obviously so random tears arent taking others velocity
nah, it's userdata so you can't write new properties on it, you need to get the data table using entity:GetData(), or you can use your own varaible i guess
TearVelocity is my own variable
^
Just store it in your own variable.
well obviously not cause it doesnt
That should work right?
entity.TearVelocity = entity.Velocity
and i think im getting an obvious thing wrong
(even tho the falling stuff still is broken)
Im trying to store the tear velocity to unfreeze it later
so
right
PissyMonobrow:AddBurn(?)
it's okay, you can admit it if your mod has bugs
But it doesn't.
It always says that my mod has a bug when the game starts.
But the debugging feature is broken.
the only thing that is above atom in ZBstudio is the debugging feature for isaac
I don't really care about the different colors.
Eh it's ok but it's ugly as hell
Eh, I use ZeroBrane.
the fact that someone made ab+ mods autocompletion for atom is the best thing that happened since we were able to change stats
thanks
it's ok, im glad u found ur solution ?
soory, this was for my own problem not yours, sorry :/
thankyou ?
I have just figured it out
it just doesnt seem to work
well, we found one
We can't find a function that changes enemy projectile falling speed.
This is my code so far:
```lua
local antimatter = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Antimatter")
function mod:antimatterTears()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
  if player:HasCollectible(antimatter) then
    for i=1, #entities do
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE then
        entities[i].Velocity = Vector(0,0)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
no but it sounds feasible, lemme test something
<@135254843567767552> Have you done this before?
Yes.
trying to freeze enemy shots?
lemme test something ive just had a eureka
hmmm
<@266032468853915650> Yes, but that won't keep them in place forever.
how do you make the range big?
When a mod crashes the game keeps on running
you can make the range big and then set the velocity of the tears to vector(0,0)
Did you check the log.txt?
all together
stop it from hitting the ground
no make it larger
the mod isent crashing, its just doesnt apper to be looping properly
lke, make the range smaller?
freeze and I were looking for how to make the enemy tears stay in place.
<@266032468853915650> Do you know how to edit enemy projectile falling speed?
ayverybody i'm back
I think it may be because DebugString expects a string, but it gets an integer and causes the mod to crash
ive tried adding an increment, just nothing i do seems to work
this is only passing the first enemy it finds and ignoreing the rest
```

function InfernoMod:BURN()
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
    if player:GetDamageCooldown() == 0 and player:GetSoulHearts() > 1 then
      player:TakeDamage(2,DamageFlag.DAMAGE_NOKILL, EntityRef(player), 0)
      local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
      local noments = #entities
        for i = 1, noments do
         local mobs = entities[i]:ToNPC();
            if entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy()    then
             Boomandburn(mobs);
             Isaac.DebugString(i)
            end
        end
    end
end```
could someone have a look at this please
But I still can't stop them from falling.
I got the tears to spawn where Isaac is standing.
<@93037421033177088>
If you tag with ID, it doesn't work.
if anyone here gets it working @ me pls
Oh
haha
<@93037421033177088>
?
how
good luck <@93037421033177088> !
yea  i will
@freeze#0973 If you get it working, let me know.
I'm going to mess around with various functions.
that will be able to help me a bit
well at least i got the velocity workin
Like most of the API.
It's probably broken.
of the projectiles
if it doesnt affect the falling speed
What is FallingSpeedModifier even for then
no one can make me think!
no!!!
makes you think, huh?
was it a meme or was it my legitimate reaction
banned for doing a meme without a permit
damn
Nope, it doesn't.
you're right
o shit waddup
@freeze#0973 Yo, there is FallingSpeedModifier(). That might work.
cant help you <@195368190333812736> sorry ive not touched grid entities yet
I think so ?
Maybe it is only for Isaac's tears?
I get error "No member named "FallingSpeed".
Anyone know?
Yeah, I tried it too, and it doesn't work.
i tried setting both the acceleration and speed to 0
hmm
nope they still fall
maybe there is still hope
i have a typo
o wait
I fear FallingSpeed is for isaac tears only :\
I just tried it and it didn't seem to work
@freeze#0973 So for falling speed, I just need entities[i].FallingSpeed = 0?
How do I make:
Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE, 1, Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y+40), false)
Spawn randomly in the room
surely the vector of velocity has direction? isnt that why there's two numbers?
yeah
after*
youll need to make a var for direction too, if you want them to move again ater
right now that stops any enemy tears as soon as they spawn

here ill show you
just in a different way
i think that's what mine is
I assume so
Like entities[i].Velocity = Vector(0,0)?
Can I do it with an array?
right now
```entity.Velocity = Vector(0,0)```
it's as simple as
sure
Will you please post your code after that?
have to*
so ill help to stop their fall speed too
they continue to fall
BUT
yo you can totally stop enemy tears velocity
Yeah.
maybe thats just cause its myself
<@93037421033177088>
i cant even get a loop to work atm -.-
I'm pretty sure you can't mention invisible users.
lol you suck at mentioning
I've been trying to get that working for a while.
@freeze#0973 If you get it doable for velocity = 0, will you please ping me with your code?
i guess i will just have to do that
doable but more work
yea I was gonna say that too. just i want to be able to unfreeze them too so i would have to get their current velocity and then reapply it
Setting velocity to zero might work.
I tried applying anti-grav.
could try seting velocity to 0?
What if I apply anti-grav to them, I wonder if that will work
it turns them grey but they keep their speed
when i try and addfreeze projectiles
haha
includeing 'hostile' tears
tear flags are hella broken atm
I don't know if that works for tears.
what about just regular ol addfreeze?
lol
Really? damn
@freeze#0973  I've tried enemy tears with flags. It hasn't worked for me.
<@145740433165647873> Hmmm?
now to see if it works with the freeze flags
thanks
hey that works
lol
Try entity.Type instead of entity.EntityType.
i dont get it
surely this should just delete enemy tears
http://pastebin.com/8FPtuXXS
by isaac I mean the player
right I tried simply removing the projectiles from the game and that doesnt even work so i guess the loop is still wrong and just not spitting out errors
I have another question. Is there a way to spawn a grid entity somewhere in the room that isaac can reach?
still no error but it still doesnt work
Can anyone who has a few hours to spare find out how to apply tear flags to enemies?
Thanks
Yep got it
do you have an image named 'trinket_wrench.png' in 'resources/gfx/items/'?
Right thats whats wrong
Yes
<@195368190333812736> Is your trinket in gfx/items?
but ill maybe try using EntityFlag.FLAG_FREEZE on it again now that the upper line is changed?
https://hastebin.com/otukidorir.lua
<@!182509747835109387> Done I have the path and the file name?
but it still doesn't work
now there's no erros
OK so
You need the path as well as the filename.
Anyone know why the graphics for my Trinket doesn't show up?
https://hastebin.com/otukidorir.lua
So did anyone figure out how to apply tear flags to enemies?
ill try that
I'm mostly just making stabs in the dark with my code
i dont know why i did that haha
change entity[i] to entity
There's nothing to be indexed
line 28 is the second line
That's a lie
wait
why are you indexing entity? It's already the entity
line 28 is the first one
ah oh yeah sorry
Which one is line 28?
i know the rest is fine cause ive used it for other things
but this is the part in question
obviously i have all the other stuff
im a newbie to lua so its probably just trash lol
http://pastebin.com/FcQTqcNH
note i have tried many different things but this is when i tried just applying the stone affect like you said
uh sure
can you make a pastebin of your code?
[INFO] - [BrokenModem] Error in PostUpdate call: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/brokenmodem/main.lua:28: attempt to index a nil value (field '?')
error
but now I have this
yea that's what I realised when I said wait i might know
Vulnerable*
if you're doing it that way, there is no variable named 'entities'. The entity itself is `entity`
I know the loop works for getting entities because I have used it in combination with IsVulenerableEnemy() and it works fine
```for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do```
for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
i have
I'm assuming that you have a `local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()` somewhere
wait i might know
[INFO] - [BrokenModem] Error in PostUpdate call: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/brokenmodem/main.lua:28: attempt to index a nil value (global 'entities')
The folder itself is right next to the mod folder
In the Isaac Afterbirth+ folder, there should be a log.txt file
where does the log output?
ok
That's what I mean. Use Isaac.DebugString to see if your function is being called
like i think it's working code just.. the wrong code lol
i dont think it's erroring i think it's just wrong
Try using Isaac.DebugString("Whatever Here") and seeing if it pops up in the log file
i feel like im just not actually catching the enemy tears in the loop correctly
addfreeze wont work either
Now is there a reason the GFX for the item isnt showing up?
ill try AddFreeze just to see if i can get it working
I could be wrong though
I don't think that's possible
im trying to avoid the stone visual effect
Try using the `AddFreeze` function instead
<@195368190333812736> it should be ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, not ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE
i cant even tell if it's the fact that i cant locate the tears or if tears just cant be affected by EntityFlag.FLAG_FREEZE
i just have no idea what else to try is the problem
[INFO] - ERR: resources/scripts/main.lua:7: bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got nil)
I'm trying to stop them all together
to change enemy tear attributes do I have to do somethin special?
wait you're trying to slow them, nevermind
I don't fully understand what that means
<@93037421033177088> The problem I think you are having is that the generic entity type does not have the bindings for the EntityTear type
<@110125570452398080> Now its not even working
https://hastebin.com/cucocecaxa.lua
is it possible to remove a golden key?
surely "if entities[i].EntityType == EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE" should work?
and still nothing
cause I tried just removing them
right ok I think I'm just messin up trying to locate the enemy tear entities
Im good with Active items but Callbacks and trinkets. Nop
Nah man its fine, we all gotta start somewhere
Thanks
Oh yeah
Mechanic:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, Mechanic.UsetheMod, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
Im bad at this
no
like that?
Mechanic:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER, Mechanic.UsetheMod)
?
Wow that's really important to know thanks !
Actually if you pass EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER as the third argument to AddCallback, it will only call for the player
Yup that's because ENTITY_TAKE_DMG is for everyone, you need to check if it's the player that takes damage
I think
Yup
Also Its spawning buttons every time something else gets hit
I read somewhere that you have to
Did you call your folder "Items" with a capital "I" ?
Mmhh
Nope
Hold on
I have it but I cant see it
no it icon of the trinket
The pressure plate ?
Cool but why is the GFX not showing up?
<@195368190333812736> For the first comment, I tried and you don''t have to specify all the parameters if you don't use them, you can leave Usethemod() if you want
I put in comments the changes
https://hastebin.com/awemayikoy.lua
Yep
/Can I try the code
<@249974366106943489> Does it now work?
Go on
<@195368190333812736> I've corrected your code
but apparently not
i thought this would give it enemy tears a 1 in 5 chance of freezing
but u get the jist
it's formatted weird
```
for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
                if entities[i].EntityType == EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE and math.random(5) == 1 then
                    entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FREEZE)
                end
end
```
Unless I'm just gettin it wrong
I tried using EntityFlag.FLAG_FREEZE on them but it doesn't seem to work on them
Does anyone have any idea on how I'd go about making enemy shots stop moving?
item*
Probably the easiest way for them to have made that tiem
I'm sure it's as simple as just tricking the game into allowing you to have infinite trinkets and whenever you use the smelter it makes you "pick it up"
hopefully it does :p
so
it'd be more work to hardcode it
^ that's what I was thinking too
It'd be a bit weird if the smelting was hardcoded, right? You'd think it just uses the base trinket code somehow
I assume it does
Good question <@228680372215349249>
...does smelter work on mod trinkets, by the way? o.o
Can someone help me with making a trinket? https://hastebin.com/jimejehone.lua
I want it to activate when I take damage but It's not doing that
nice
always good to know
sweet!
I'll upload source code to Github later
So you can tell if you're in the same run or not if the seed for that RNG is the same or different
and entity:GetDropRNG() gets an RNG that is always consistent between runs
the key was using RNG():GetSeed(), which gets the seed for any given RNG
and also correctly killed on a new run
Transformation now persistent even with a full game exit
<@266032468853915650> <@109624258317033472> Got it!
Shit.
Oh maybe not... Ive forgotten some.
XOR XAND NAND, etc
Thanks for the reminder on OR and AND. everythings coming back to me now
Ah fuck yeah im getting confused with Homestuck now
thank you
| is bitwise OR and & is bitwise AND. They are not 'hard to read' and are, in fact, the correct operator to use in this situation
that seems pretty legit actually
hm if you think so
With ```:``` and not ```.```
player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED) maybe ?
here's the code
player.AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED)
i just wondered what bad argument #2 would mean in general
take a look
I uploaded the second update of my mod
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837414680
| is division & is multiplication... I think
<@!182509747835109387> Sorry I don't know :/
I always have trouble reading them.
I don't like bitwise operators.
Oh nice
You should use `yourEntity.TearFlags = yourEntity.TearFlags | THEFLAGSYOUWANT` instead
yeah
Oh wait Lua5.3 has bitwise operators
without code we wont be able to help much
"[INFO] - [Leprosy Mod] Error in PostUpdate call: ...Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/leprosy/main.lua:23: bad argument #2 to 'AddCacheFlags' (number expected, got no value)" help?
<@110125570452398080> Yes if you want to do things right you need to check if the bit is already set!
TearFlag.FLAG_HOMING
do i use TearFlag.FLAG_HOMING or just FLAG_HOMING
<@!182509747835109387> Yes for me too I'm trying to find out why aha
Error in PostUpdate call: ...Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/finn's ipecac/main.lua:133: attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value (field 'TearFlags')

<@266032468853915650>  The flags are here https://hastebin.com/onovihirov.hs
thanks!
<@266032468853915650> ```yourEntity.TearFlags = yourEntity.TearFlags + THEFLAGSYOUWANT```
Yes yo ucan
Do I just put this at the top of my code?
how do i set the tearflags of a tear entity I just spawned
Or you can just refer to this document to use the bit shifting style (1 << 2)
If you want to use the string name of the flags yes : https://hastebin.com/onovihirov.hs
Do I need it?
No.
<@!182509747835109387> You have the TearFlags enum somewhere in your code ?
in the log it lists it as: "RNG Start Seed: XDKB HE69 (2537385070)"
So it isn't possible to add tear flags to enemies?
so frustrating
Ah okay no worries
sorry
i dont know
its probably one of the seeds converted in ascii or something
yes
ahh
or random stuff like "HIJG 01JK"
he wants to know how tho get the run seed that you can see on pause
Like "BASE MENT"
Like if you hit start, you see the seed
whats that
?
<@109624258317033472> or do you know how to get the GGGG GGGG seed?
Error in PostUpdate call: ...Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/finn's ipecac/main.lua:74: attempt to index a nil value (global 'TearFlags')

<@266032468853915650> You know how to get the seed? Like specifically the GGGG GGGG seed?
Yep
So like this:
      if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
<@!182509747835109387> My bad, try with entities[i].Type
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.antimatterTears)
<@!182509747835109387> You're adding this function to which callback ?
No errors though
<@195368190333812736> Thats how youd do it with roms SpawnGridEntity
```
local room = Game():GetRoom()
room:SpawnGridEntity( room::GetGridIndex(player.Position), GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE, 1, room:GetSpawnSeed(), 0)```
It doesn't.
<@!182509747835109387> Yes I think so
i never tried Isaacs Gridspawn
no. sorry
<@109624258317033472>     Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE, 1, Game():GetRoom():GetGridIndex(player.Position.X-40, player.Position.Y-40), false)
Like that?
<@249974366106943489> So this should work?
```lua
local antimatter = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Antimatter")
function mod:antimatterTears()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
  if player:HasCollectible(antimatter) then
    for i=1, #entities do
      if entities[i].EntityType == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
        entities[i].TearFlags = entities[i].TearFlags + TearFlags.FLAG_ANTI_GRAVITY
      end
    end
  end
end
```
Isaacs Gridspawns works different
no wait
<@195368190333812736> Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE, 1, Game():GetRoom():GetGridIndex(player.Position), false)
Yes
So for my code, entity should be entities[i]?
<@!182509747835109387> 
```if entity.EntityType == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then   
```
How do I get this:
Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE, 1, pos, false)
To spawn under the player?
<@109624258317033472> How do I get the tear entities for everything in the room?
just to tears
you might dont want to applay tear flags to every entity
You don't even know the API.
looks good to me
This isn't working:
```lua
local antimatter = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Antimatter")
function mod:antimatterTears()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
  if player:HasCollectible(antimatter) then
    for i=1, #entities do
      entities[i].tearflags = entities[i].tearflags + TearFlags.FLAG_ANTI_GRAVITY
    end
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.antimatterTears)
```
couldn't have put it better myself
but ' = `
'''code
code
'''
damn
` ` ` code
code
` ` `
first it's player.Position no player.position
<@213795824507944960> use `````
`````
Mod2 = RegisterMod("Mechanic's Wrench", 1)
local Wrench =  Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Mechanic's Wrench")

function MyMod2:UsetheMod()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local use = math.random(0, 1)
  local room = Game():GetRoom()
  local pos = player.position
  
  if use >=0 and use <1 then
    Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_POOP, 1, pos, false)
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)  
  end
end
MyMod2:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod2.UsetheMod, Wrench )
Reason why this code wont work?
What are*
What is the TopLeftClamp and the BottomLeftClamp by the way ?
Maybe I messed up with the order of the function calls aha
I tried with render yes
indeed ^^
cool !
sure you can
wait can you render sprites on screen directly ?
and set the position correctly
did you call render?
Yes
created a new one?
which sprite did you use tho?
xD
<@109624258317033472> I don't know, at first to do this I didn't think the fart could be an entity aha. And as I didn't manage to do it with Sprite() it bothers me. It didn't work for me the load, play :/
i mean, you can do Sprite:Load(path) to the fart anm2 file and play it
<@249974366106943489> why would you only do it with a sprite?
<@229593818691928067> ok thanks, I'll ask again to see if someone knows !
i'm not sure <@249974366106943489> but you can make a dummy entity to hold your sprite!
<@229593818691928067> Yes ok but you know if it's possible without an Entity ? To learn how to manipulate the Sprite and the animation
the purple tint looks kind of weird on those
It probably looks weird because it's a blood tear then
<@!129339380090404864> i'm pretty sure it is a blood tear tinted purple, i'll just have to find the right tint :p
<@229593818691928067> is the orbital firing a regular or blood tear?
<@249974366106943489> if you want the fart to do nothing you can change the entity returned by  Isaac.Spawn() to do nothing
Hi everyone!
I want to spawn a fart around Isaac. I managed to do that with Isaac.Spawn() but I want to do it just by using Sprite(), is it possible ? And how ?
doesn't look the same :/
hehehah
oh ok
Just apply the costume for Spoon Bender.
it's just a tinted tear
the homing part is a TearFlag, i meant the tear visual
It is a homing tear.
also can we play sounds ?
or is it just a purple tint
would anyone happen to know what the purple tear is, from the purple fires ?
Okay.
if you don't know how to do that then try the potentially easier but less likely to work way
How?
assuming they are separate entities?
and turn every single projectile into an IPECAC projectile
would be to post process projectiles
a better idea
cya ^^
that's probably not going to work
ok, bye guys!
a mod directed by Michael Bay
TIME TO GIVE ALL ENEMIES IPECAC
i think to all
GOOD
Although most of them seem bugged
<@!182509747835109387> You set the flags on whatever entity you want
<@223869207748542464> Do tear flags apply to all entities or just the player?
i fixed it
<@223869207748542464>  might know
never worked with them
Because I want to give enemies tear effects.
<@266032468853915650> Do tear flags apply to all entities or just the player?
Just do player:RemoveCollectible()
hey guys do you know how to remove an activated item once used?
let the likes and retweets flow
2nd retweet by edmoind aww yea
congratulations!
HOLY JESUS CHRIST
i need to edit it...
just scaling of my tear...
what the fuck
Arf, just wanted to change the name of a transforamtion :/
i just realized the shadow
oh.
that explosion seems rather small in comparison
<@191377468706390017> Not really, many of us are working on them by trial and error
sheesh
oh.. that scaling
https://streamable.com/kxiu4
So nobody knows where can i find informations about transformations? :/
And I assue to make it do something when the frame count hits 60 seconds you can do:
if Game:GetFrameCount() % 1800 then
cool
^
if Game:GetFrameCount() % 1800 == 0 then
modulo
no
what
?
Game:ResetFrameCount()
like for the whole run
but what if I want to keep doing it?
so 30x60
30frames = 1 second
Game:GetFrameCount()
Whats a way to check if its been 1 minute on the ingame timer
D100 and some other items change the seed
good idea but maybe not perfect
check fo the seed
I need some way to tell when a run is a new run or not
between runs
yeah
If I clear it on player init, it will never save it lol
just clear it on player init lol
which means once you get the transformation once, you have it forever -_-
<@109624258317033472> <@266032468853915650> almost got it working, but it's saving it forever now lol
use a better api imo
Or function.
Because that's the only way to tell if you pick up a lucky penny because there's no callback for picking up a consumable.
Does anyone know how to tell when a stat changes using Lua?
¯\_(?)_/¯
When i Turn into Bob i want another text than "Bob" to display
Title*
I can change item description in items.xml but can't find such a file for transformations
Wait, transformations don't even have descriptions.
yeah ^^'
Oh, that doesn't exist.
Probably
It's in transformations.xml
Hi guys I have a problem, i want to change transforamtion description but i don't know how :/
get out
oh is bloody lust power up ?
where's samson bandanaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ?
thats a really fucking cool idea. nice!
https://gfycat.com/SphericalPointedBangeltiger
yup yup
but its really not that hard, just try ^^
no really.
thanks btw
Do you have any examples where you've used it?
Yee
yep
then you just include a load in the init callback?
yeah
is that suffiecient to save it?
I see okay
tostring(myVariable)
no
yes
you can ofcourse make the string incredibly long and safe multiple variables in it
so it's Isaac.SaveModdata(MyMod, myvariable)
yep.
one string per mod
yeah. but it can just save one string
It's that easy?
you put your mod in there. the variable you got from var = RegisterMod(..)
I'm not even sure what a "table ref" is
but not sure how it works
There is a function called SaveModData()
and no, it isn't "character_007_samsonshairandbandanna.png"
Hmm okay
if I knew I would xd
<@266032468853915650> Do you know how to save mod data?
guys do you know where is samson's bandana?
cause i dont save mod data
yeah
yeah
transformation lost
guys, is there a way to make textures warp around something? Like black hole?
Get the transformation, drop the trinket, exit the game (fully, like exit the exe and everything), restart the game, hit continue
I noticed it has the same bug as my mod however
<@266032468853915650> I like your Snappy Mod, I was playing around with it a bit
95/100
<@268036083827212290> fucking 3/4 of functions are badly documented or dont work...
np ^^
<@109624258317033472>  mass="0" worked, thanks
I wonder how long most entity flags are gonna be broken for
set its mass to 0 might work too
some sort of entity flag maybe?
how do I make an entity not be affected by external forces ie.Explosions
Is it the way to make it so that variables from your mod are saved between exiting the game and returning?
Anyone have any experience with Isaac.SaveModData()?
```lua
if nullEntity:GetSprite():IsLoaded() and nullEntity:GetSprite():GetFilename() ~= targetSpritePath then
            nullEntity:GetSprite():Load(targetSpritePath,true)
            nullEntity:GetSprite():Play(targetAnimation)
        end```
something like that
oke thanks
i changed tears into chaos card animations with sprite load so sure it works
lets try. ill report back
idk
shoudnt Sprite:Load work?
yeah, but my idea was to change the appearance of an key, to make stuff easy
<@109624258317033472> i think u can make different frames(IDK how they called, animations?) and swap to them
that uses other anims
I dont think so but you can transform it into other entity
xD
yea xd
Bounces back tears as chaos cards?
is it possible to change the anm2 file of an entity/sprite at runtime?
oh...
https://i.gyazo.com/a7acea459bbca07ad16ae3f27a6b629e.gif not op at all
"Forget Me Again" More like "Wait what?"
lol
Forget Me Again, the trinket. Chance on getting hit to restart the entire game. Can't be dropped, carries over to new games.
just note everything down like i do
that sucks. damn ^^
guys, that is so painful!
i got a trinket idea then someone distracted me and i forgot the idea.
oh yea, that mod
Not like we have allready Pride-day challenge
They didn't change anything
what would that be, dicks everywhere?
Yee
... someone did? really?
Why did someone make a issac gay mod?
but wont resize
It still spawns
nope
``bigFire.Scale = 2``
not 0.5
oh
try ``bigFire.Scale = 0.5``
And its not like there is error coz it compiles and runs without any errors
ok
spawining works, resizing dont
yup
do you have ``player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)``?
tried bigFire.Size = 2 as well
Why wont this work?
bigFire = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT,EffectVariant.RED_CANDLE_FLAME,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
    bigFire.SizeMulti = Vector(2,2)
This supposed to work:
those random RoboBaby emotes still confuse the hell out of me
hm. sounds not bad ^^
I don't know about anything else yet
it's a ripoff of spelunky
it's got good art (especially chairs) and good text display
sounds... interesting?
a game about chairs
winter's game
may i ask what hellbound is?
sorry, I meant isaac apis, and besides that I do have an old version of hellbound
so
well you don't have antibirth *or* limt's other api
YALL DRIVING ME CRAZY D:
you don't have hellbound api!
?
nothing
3? what did i miss?
3
melon has access to the highest number of apis
it's true
sounds legit
cuz we're gay
that's entity 1000.1
why do you all have access to the antibirth API ._. now im courious
EffectVariant.BOMB_EXPLOSION
that's its variant enum
at least that's what it's called in antibirth api
it's an effect
BOMBEXPLOSION
i think
<@229593818691928067> is the explosion an entity?
Yeah, probably.
don't tell me i have to check for a collision with an explosion entity ?
that was already in AB ^^
I've spent all my time with Afterbirth+ modding it and not playing it, I guess.
oh that's what it is
Oh. Huh. Didn't know that.
<@112975821186031616> Big rooms do that yea
yeah ?
Anyone else occasionally getting 2 charges from clearing a room?
hmm
for that marshmallow thing
ohhh
no it's an orbital
does that entity die?
how can i detect an entity getting blown up ? (it doesn't take damage)
indeed
hard to keep track of how nicalis is fucking with things these days
i did but it somehow didnt work. i dont know if its me or the game.
you should be able to
can i just replace sounds by dropping the same-named .wav file in the correct folder structure in my mod?
I don't mind OP Void
<@109624258317033472> thx
Fuck the nerfed void tho
Kappa
pff, those scrubs who need everything nerfed >-> l2p
Baaaaad
how bad was the unnerfed vis sisters I missed it
I bet you someone's gonna make a unerfed vis sisters mod
<@223869207748542464> thats some cool scale you got there. i like it
I see
<@240743817530179584> i would say it's haunt difficulty(scale from friendly fly to unnerfed vis sisters)
does :ToNpc work ?
K
Like I said definately possible but not really all that easy
True
I mean it sounds realistic
I know but we could reverse engineer stuff to make the idea from the other chat
haha <@240743817530179584> thats still beyond me man
don't forget to give it a low chance to instakill you!
you mean the recharge station from antibirth?
that should be possible.
No like remakeing the recharge station
Ah, alright. Nice! Thanks guys
selecting the same metadata you have before will make it update rather than upload a new version ?
oh it knows
if you havent deleted the metadata.xml it knows, yes
yeah you click upload again
That it's the same mod?
Does it just know?
"update"
Yea but there's no option to like
<@93037421033177088> same way you uploaded it ?
try it and find out!
i cant remember
Do we still use the tool?
yes but you have to program your own ai if you want a completely new enemy
didnt i ascend too
Hey dunno if this goes here: how do you update a mod on the Steam workshop? Like upload a new version?
sure
Hey can we make entities in AB+ yet?
RoboBaby knows whats up
^
you don't have solid evidence
pshh
sure
no i didnt >->
you actually said it
fool
you lied to me
xD
?
sorry i can't lie
see? scayze knows
but noodle made him a demon again
I'm just telling it like it more is
appa tried to ascend like 2 times
like, i would choose demon. But honestly, i havent met a single cool person who was a demon
me too!
i don't even know how i ascended tbh
I'm just telling it like it is
pajeet ascended somehow
sorry limt just has a massive ego join demons if you want!
i was a demon once
you join them if the angels are too cool for you and you don't want to embarrass yourself
isee
and that
yeah demons are the loser team
demons get access to <#227892564513128458> while angles get access to <#227892477162553344>
and whats with demon? is that different?
that'd be rad
i want to be an angle ?
oh
wat
There should be a 3rd category just for angles now ?
you have to say "imma chargin my angel"
69º
right
acute
which degree?
i want to be an angle
rude
no you have to say that
xd
xD
ahh shut up
i want to be an angle
angle
also, <@145740433165647873> how does one get to be an angel/demon? just courious ?
you should feel honored xD
is this the first and only time in history <@145740433165647873> didn't call my mod shit?
not due to death but by picking up a trophy / jumping  in the chest
is there a way to find out when a run ends?
<@266032468853915650> cool!
no.
thats actually really cool! nice one!
anyone used PlaySound ?
nice
now the range is ok
https://i.gyazo.com/38f78f5fdc401d65e8fe827d2a085c3f.gif
you'd be invincible and stuff
cause you know
only when it hits the familiar
is it gonna stay like that or will you do that only when something hits the familiar?
https://i.gyazo.com/92bb2001a9e33120f2eb4d95cf4bccd6.gif it works!!!
if u divide that id by 3, you get 3, the iloominati has 3 sides
id=9
thanks!
id=9
ENTITY_PROJECTILE
is there a specific entity type for enemy tears?
```there was an error running the lua file``` is the only error
thats an error i get popping up for example
> [INFO] - [Pacman] Error in PostUpdate call: ... Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/pacman/main.lua:205: bad argument #1 to 'TryRemoveCollectibleCostume' (number expected, got nil)
oh
thats fine
thats no error.
Whenever I used it
It says "Non standard collectible used"
oh. all tear variatns are in entities2.xml? cool. good to know ?
there often pop errors up
i copied a default tear entity from entities2.xml and changed variant, made a custom animation file and sprite for it. BTW sprite and animation file is not mine, Icerzz made it for me.
open it
found it, now what?
C:\Users\[yourname]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+\log.txt
where is the log file?
sorry this is my first mod but
how did you do it afterall?
thx
cool ?
they look amazing holy shit
thx
nice!
https://streamable.com/5zmqi Fully working custom tears
check the log file
Because that didn't work
```Entity:Isaac.GetPlayer(0):GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(ActiveEffect[math.random(ActiveEffect.Count)], true)```
So this?
<@187282809457475585> GetEffects() not GetEffect
does anyone know how to add a custom revive item?
anyway
Could anyone help me out? I'm trying to make an item that can use any active item (similar to Dead Sea Scrolls, but works with every item) but whenever I try to use the item, no effect occurs.
My code's here http://pastebin.com/RhLNKQM3 (I'll add all possible item effects once I can get the items actually working, for now it only chooses from a few effects)
anyway
fair enough. that suffices me
uh, i managed to remove an costume

Damn <@216324079504982016>
maybe i'll just forget costume for now
!pick angel
i don't know !
<@229593818691928067> i have 4 ? how?
does anyone know how to get the state of a fireplace ?
also on ```mvModpack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mvModpack.onUpdate, );``` you left a comma
<@109624258317033472> when you get 3 you can choose between Demon and Angel ?
I modified the callback name before and forget to pass on the change
Oh, right
bacuse you set the callback to ```mvModpack:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, mvModpack.cache );```
the name of the function is supposed to be mvModpack:cache
```function mvModpack:MC_EVALUATE_CACHE(player,cacheFlag)
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_TEARFLAG then
    if player:HasCollectible(Tranxene_item) then
        player.TearFlags = setbit(player.TearFlags, bit(46))
        player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(108, false)
        player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 0.90
     end
 end
end````
found a problem
ok, lemme take a look
^ surely a lot of crap in there
There  <@266032468853915650> https://hastebin.com/ejeganizul.lua
no seriously are those items good for anything?
i always wanted a wig
Amazing
YES. RoboBaby told me i just found Moms Wig
let me clear it a bit
there is a lot of shit in there
easier to see the problems
put your main.lua on hastebin
Still nothing. I don't understand xD
Yep, testing...
and make sure your item updates cache flags xd
Theres that too
Think Lyte's tutorials started with searching for multiple players. In the off-chance someone makes a multiplayer mod or something, I'm guessing.
try doing ```        if player:HasCollectible(ToujoursDebout_item) then
      Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(reno)
    end```
I got lost in my testing, i think. I only have 3 days of learning Lua, haha
why search for more players?
¯\_(?)_/¯
why tho
```function mvModpack:cache(player)
    for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
        if player:HasCollectible(ToujoursDebout_item) then
      Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(reno)
    end
  end
end```
ok
Yes ? http://i.imgur.com/UxB4XrG.png
you sure the anm2 is right?
That's why i ultimetely tried to see how others people did, haha :p
After this, tried different things and nothing works ?
So, that's in place.
and in the ``main.lua`` :
```
local reno = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/reno.anm2")
```
```
<costumes anm2root="gfx/characters/">
    <costume anm2path="reno.anm2" priority="99" type="none" />
</costumes>
```
how's your costumes.xml looking?
got the sprite & anm2 in the right place, etc
ok
i'm tring to apply a costume to the character when i take an item
what's the problem
how to did you do man
Holy
eyy that's my mod
the code in the snappy mod is : 
```
[...]
if player:HasCollectible(snappysHead_item) and player:HasCollectible(snappysShell_item) and player:HasTrinket(snappysTail_trinket) then
    hasSnappy = true
    Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(costume)
  end
```
i just don't understand why
i was taking the Snappy costume as example but when i try to copy the way it was done, i got nothing
for me isaac just crashed
i havent gotten it to work myself, but i havent been trying much either
<@81035468866584576> tell me if you find out ?
Time to get littered by trees.
maybe there is another way to apply a costume, i'm surely doing it the bad way -_-
its ents[i]
it isnt enitities[i]
fuck me
i doesn't work lol
Nope, does not work :/
whats wrong with the code,  Kyo?
xd
one banana and a cherry
about one banana deep
<@81035468866584576> does it work tho? i heard it has to be in the render callback, im not sure if this is corret tho
how deep tho ( ?° ?? ?°)
the fact that you use __sub confuses me deeply
in the update one <@109624258317033472>
```    local ents = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #entities do
      local e = entities[i]
      if e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR  then
        if e.Position:__sub(mirror.Position) < 100 then
          e.Velocity = -e.Velocity
        end
      end
    end``` do you guys have any idea what's wrong here?
also, where do you apply the costume, in the render callback orupdate?
oh
the main player has the id 0 tho
you start iterating with 1 in the loop
>_<
i know
no
OH
seems fine to me
i dont know
hm.
```local reno = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/reno.anm2")```
what is reno? where is it defined?
It does not add the costume ?
any input on why this is garbage ?
```
function mvModpack:cache(player)
    for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
        if player:HasCollectible(ToujoursDebout_item) then
      Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(reno)
    end
  end
end
```
Just tried it with projectiles
I was about to come back and say that haha
Yeah
just from a minute of testing the shot a horf shoots is a ENTITY_PROJECTILE not a tear
hmmmmm
doesn't seem to be
i havent tried it myself though
yeah i guess so
specifically
Or, enemy tears
But will it also work on tears?
This works on enemies
entity:AddEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_FREEZE)
what do you mean by that?
But maybe not
I assumed yes
Can you apply entity flags to tears?
ill try that
ok
ah
. is for Attributes and : for functions
entity.Type not ":"
really?
that should work tho
That didn't work
I tried something like "entity:Type==EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR" but
is it an enemy shot
effectively entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() except instead of that
How do I do a check on if an entity is an enemy tear?
here ya go
but I've never done lua so
this is something that is probably super basic
So
RIght
yeah freeze ^^ heres a good place to start
nice and simple then
I am going to assume the answer is yes
should be fine
i only need to save one value
so unless you can serialize yourself, with the json they didn't give us access to or one of the lua serializers it's not terribly useful
ohhhhhh, that makes sense, thanks ?
like this channel
but it takes a string and mod:LoadData() returns a string
I have a super basic antibirth mod LUA question is this the right place to ask?
you call it with the table returned from RegisterMod, so if you did `local mod = RegisterMod(...)` it would be mod:SaveData()
damn
ah ky.
sorry, I don't deal with ab+ because it sucks a lot
haha
<@145740433165647873> do you know how to use SaveModData? what do i give as tale ref parameter?
I feel like I see your icon everywhere
lol
also i moderate some twitch channels sometimes
u may have seen that
edmund retweeted me yesterday for my mod
practically all I do is code, and I loathe every minute of it
you're familiar but I don't remember what you've done
im new to this modding stuff, is this where i ask about programming stuff cause im a scrub?
hey freeze!
hello !
hello
damn
> EntityColisionClass = ENTCOLL_ALL
doesn't work ?
Idk how to code at all
I'll probably have to find someone who'd be willing to implement arcade machines
what do i gave "table red" as parameter
also, how do i use SaveModData?
EntityColisionClass = ENTCOLL_ALL or sth like that
how do i make my familiar collide with enemy tears though
i'm making a boss with a guy name Jon
would love to do a group project afterwards
In the moment i have a solo project
?
do you guys have some group project or are you making your own way
just say that here
far better than working alone
working in a mod team is really cool
yeah
Isaac.SaveModData works betweeen runs, doesnt it?
i agree too
I feel like the icon would make more sense as a jar of blood seeing as the brimstone beam is supposedly blood
right
Antigravity brimstone
Yes
that swirl was already in the game right ?
wait i realized
I'm leaving most of the ambiguous choices to the person who came up with the idea
hey maybe it could disappear as soon as it finishes firing one brimstone ?
your video is loading i'll get back to you on that in a minute or two
your video is loading i'll get back to you on that in a minute or two
I remember back when our internet did like 50kB/s for some reason
kB
when it's good
kb or kB?
i also have 100kb/s internet ?

https://streamable.com/8vmem
lol i tried
Also, uh, update graphics driver?
Oh wait linux, right, there's no linux ShareX
old laptop + linux + outdated graphics driver -> can't record at more than 15fps
I don't even gif record
Cuz you can gif record with ShareX on a lot of things. It will just be a bit laggy ?
Is your computer a Nes Classic ?
no i can't make a video because my computer is not powerful enough :p
So, hum, how can change the way bomb act ?
xD
yayaya
;D
*not nearly as good*
or, a little bit easier but not quite as good. Get Monosnap
Then you can press a few buttons, click on the screen, play, press the stop button, wait a bit and just paste the link
3. Set destination as streamable
2. Configure screen recording with ffmpeg and install the devices from the menu
1. Get ShareX
If you want to record stuff easily
i can't make a video no
can you show us what it looks like?
I don't think it's any bigger than that
<@135254843567767552> maybe it's because i have a bigger sprite
i guess
If you set the Position, it's gonna be choppy, because it won't get interpolated, right?
https://files.catbox.moe/c5jucy.mp4 is this choppy to you or is yours choppier?
yes that does it but it looks choopy :p
i guess just `familiar.Position = familiar:GetOrbitPosition(player.Position)` instead of FollowPosition?
maybe not, but attack flys have a lag and they do orbit the player, so i was just a bit off there
orbitals aren't supposed to behave in such a way !
well yes !
oh i see, you're concerned about how it has to catch up to the player
and it orbits around you like a cube of meat, it doesn't follow behind you ?
so if it's doing something weird and you've done all that then your issue may be somewhere else
the only things i do to get mine working is when i spawn it i call ```lua
newEntity.OrbitDistance = Vector(40,40)
                newEntity.OrbitSpeed = 0.01
                newEntity.OrbitLayer = 99```

and when I update it I call ```lua
                familiar:FollowPosition(familiar:GetOrbitPosition(player.Position))```
i don't get this
can i see your code ?
yes ?
did you set a non 0 orbit speed?
<@135254843567767552> help
wait but now it follows me, doesn't orbit ??
You did set non-0 OrbitSpeed, right?
i'm not sure how to force that to update without just spawning and killing an entity on that orbit layer
i have found that the orbit doesn't update until an entity on that orbit layer dies though...
nice
ooh
I'm just calling `familiar:FollowPosition(familiar:GetOrbitPosition(player.Position))` every update
am i missing something ?
i saw that, and i want it to behave like any other orbital but how ?
i have, the only thing i haven't managed to do is update the orbit arbitrarily
have you managed to do that ?
`GetOrbitPosition (Vector Pos)`
instead of calculating it manually that is
familiars do have orbit attributes which you could use
```local function onMallowUpdate(_, mallow)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    
    mallow.Position = player.Position + (Vector.FromAngle(mallow.OrbitAngleOffset) * mallow.OrbitDistance.X)
    mallow.OrbitAngleOffset = mallow.OrbitAngleOffset + mallow.OrbitSpeed
end```
i'm making a familiar that orbits around the player, but when i move it looks choopy, unlike native familiars how could i fix that ?
So, if i wanted to be more clear, i want to make Bombs bounce all over the screen like 3 or 4 times before exploding in a way like Lil' Gurdy. That should be better said like this :p
Yeah, i just checked what others terms there are associated with "dribbling"
Discord, please send my messages
xD
Yeah, i just checked what others terms there are associated with "dribbling"
Yeah, i just checked what others terms there are associated with "dribbling"
Well, the first thing I imagine with "dribbling all over" is a drunk guy with saliva streaming from his mouth
Well, the first thing I imagine with "dribbling all over" is a drunk guy with saliva streaming from his mouth
``Bounce`` might be more clear
Maybe I got the wrong idea about the word, lemme check
I mean
English is not my mother tongue, sometimes i do not find the right word right away ^^
and we didnt even say butt on our own
RoboBaby gives us emotes
do you know whats great about PeanutButter?
Like when you dribble with a basket ball ?
Dribbling all over the screen
Maybe i am
Are you having a stroke?
What the fuck did i say Peanut Butter xD
I was speaking of Lil Gurdy
Holy
Let me check, i might have the wrong name
And don't know where to look
I can't find it on platinumgod
I mean
The orbital ?
Peanut butter?
But
Maybe there is something like ``bomb:GetEffects():AddBabyEffect(PeanutButter, false)`` ? (It's false, just tryng to figure where to look. The documentation is non helping much)
yea
Can we add challenges ?
I have a little idea for another item in my mod but i don't know where to start : i want to make bomb with the effect of Peanut butter, dribbbling all over the screen, can it be done ?
sounds like the most basic stuff any modders would first try to do
i don't get how they thought we wouldn't want to just add our itemps to the pools
yeah that works
Most tutorials i find either replace an existing item or just give it as a strater item to a character
there none
no
Is there a good way to add items to a pool ?
Thank you very much xd
i think i can do something with that
then
ok
hmm
So how I use it (myself) is set a flag in player init and if the flag is set check if it's a new game **once** in update
like KubeRoot said, left is a Vector(-x,0) (where x is the speed of your projectile)
Doesn't work in `POST_PLAYER_INIT` and probably has redundant bits
thanks
```lua
local function isNewGame()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    return game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1
end```
<@126590786945941504> can you send me your on new game code
or Im doing something wrong then
i cannot put that directly on the velocity
but
<@220521972235239425> i know that
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_entity_player.html#a0f6e52538846c670d74db4fb2438488e
Also, because of how it works, you can do ```lua
local veltab = {
    [0] = Vector(-1, 0),
    Vector(0, -1),
    Vector(1, 0),
    Vector(0, 1)
}``` and do `veltab[player:GetFireDirection()]` to get a vector or `nil`
player.GetFireDirection() returns one of those  : NO_DIRECTION     
LEFT     
UP     
RIGHT     
DOWN
I didn't try modding tears yet,
a vector is what you need
it tells you LEFT, RIGHT etc what do you need ??
can i do something with that xd_
it returns a direction
tells you
firedirection
it doesnt work there
or at least
I cannot put GetFireDirection
but how do i change it so it shoots in the same direction as the player
Well, technically, the direction an entity is moving is it's velocity vector
Hello
Hello
Hello
<@132627275307810817> you'll need to make the vectors based on the direction
well! it works!
eys
yay custom wall collisions because fuck me I don't know how to do them properly
https://streamable.com/ujie1
are you french ?
jean alphonse ?
and velocity
only position
Thats what confuses me
but theres no direction enum on .FireTear
hmm
it's an enum
on the .FireTear xd
is where to put that
what i dont know
look at player.FireDirection
how do you change the direction of .Firetear so it shoots the tear in the same dir as the player?
question guys
hmm
familiars tend to have an item associated with them, but i'm not sure what that's got to do with the list of all items
??
i'm confused
wait no that's for entities
the variant and possibly subtype
for familiars it's always id=3 so how would i know about a particular familiar
I don't know much about the ab+ api, but if it doesn't have a direct function for it you would want to iterate through all ID numbers with that and collect the valid ones in a table
player:HasCollectible( ID )
how could i get a list of all items the player has?
is that good ? ^^
top flaming one looks shiny
<@!129339380090404864> is that better ?
spawn 3.118, but it's a non issue because it turns out i spelled it entites.xml, so nevermind me
how are you spawning it ?
i'm not sure what the reason is, but `[INFO] - config for entity 3.118 is missing` so first assumption is entities2.xml is in the wrong folder (it's in /mod/content/)
What's your problem?
If you want a new variant of an existing id, then include the id but don't include a variant
yeah i'm assuming i know how to do it but want to know why it doesn't work
If you want a new id, then don't include an id
Well, it's not hard
tons
is there a mod out there that actually adds a new variant or id using entities2.xml that can be spawned in?
entities2.xml is loaded yes
it must...
the lit versions look kind of pillowy
I would just use the shading you had for the white one
is entities2.xml also not loaded like itempools.xml?
don't be nicalis
nicalis already uses the fires on small sprites
<@!129339380090404864> how would you do the shading? ? i just copied the design by Handsome_Claptrap
I wouldn't use those fires on a sprite that small
oh but there's smaler versions for when you shoot them
they might be too big
right :p
sorry
yeah
not bonfire, just those fireplaces that are everywhere
regular fireplaces ?
what's a bonfire ?
sandbag
what
<@145740433165647873> lol
limt more like blindmt
ohh it's a marshmallow, I thought it was a sandbag
:conwayshrug:
I like the sprites but the shading on the ignited versions is kind of weird
cant you also steal the fire animation from the bonfires? =p
xD
i stole the fire from Fire mind ?
wow thats pretty good
if the fire is also animated, that would be beautiful!
thanks!
they look sick!
dude

they look kind of small
<@229593818691928067> how big are those marshmallow sprites compared to the fat fly or a baby?
~~why did you do that now its going to be even worse~~
anoda wone
another one
oh gosh
xD
let me add you on steam !
oh that's you !
nice!
there it is
y e    s
m o d
did you release a mo    d
i dont know :c
why are people adding you on steam though
i dont know because i was not a celebrity before xD
why dont you put your profile on private?
congratz. Youre an Isaac celebrity now ^^
lol
also can someone kill me everyone is sending me friend request on steam
i didnt even realize blue baby had red hearts
bab
REDB ABY
I think it's funny for blue baby to have red hearts
why did you decide on blue baby, anyway?
that's just your opinion
that's not real isaac
WHAT

resizing would have looked weird
I haven't tried, I didn't need to do it so far
¯\_(?)_/¯
resizing usually looks awful. But who knows
Or maybe straight from Entity, not sure
Or just the sprite
You can resize them in the anm2 file
I mean
but the sprites themself look gorgeus ^^
the aura seems a little bit too thick imo
you think? they look great!
doesn't look quite as good
i did ?
you could resize them ? Kappa
welp

that a cool idea
i thought i could copy/paste the sprites but... they're way too big, i had to redo them ?
good luck with that c:
either way, id love to see the results ?
not my idea no
yeah nobody has done it yet, i figured nobody would be mad
or do you picked it up?
was that your idea?
uhh! thats cool! i saw that on the reddits like half a year ago ?

probably releasing today ^^
the pacman one
what is your mod ?
damn
its an fucking eyesore
ye
1k in one file ?
on what mods are you gus working?
hit the 1k lines of my mod! Hoorey. done soon! ?
Ty!

https://twitter.com/Narx221/status/819205866658426881
you can see that in the amount of "FUCK"s that appear in my code comments
nah, but im really getting aggrevated by the amount of erros and exceptions my code throws
yeah
are you constipated ?
yay. i got a minidump! ?
i'll keep them in mind
In general entityflags seem like they're the most unappreciated feature (by me) I've seen so far
yup thanks
Where it scales to normal size
Appearing
That also skips the animation of the entity, well, uhh
nice ! thanks <@126590786945941504>
<@229593818691928067> ```lua
            ent:ClearEntityFlags(EntityFlag.FLAG_APPEAR)
```
Is it possible to apply a transformation for a single room?
xD
thanks...
i really should sleep
lol
that's my opinion
bfhdghdfgsfd
i think it should be uppercase I
```if player:isDead() and player:WillPlayerRevive() == true then
            playerDead()
end```
yeah it's IsDead not isDead
<@126590786945941504> would you know how to prevent the "poof" from an entity spawning ?
main.lua:153: attempt to call a nil value (method 'isDead')
i I
IsDead ?
wat
player:isDead() is a nil value?
oh it triggers EVALUTE_CACHE
i made a familiar that i spawn when i pickup a passive, but when Isaac picks up another familiar it triggers RespawnFamiliars, except mine doesn't respawn... any idea how i could get a callback from that ?
lol
?
my bad
yeah youre right
player has it too
oh.
it's Entity::IsDead i think
ive thought ive seen that function too
atleast, its not in my docs
doesnt exist
player:IsDead?
is there a way to check if the player is dead (before a revive like 9 lives is triggerd)?
At least the comments called it out
Yeah, bit of a shame that he didn't update the post.
But come on, Lua 5.3 has built-in bitwise operators, stop spreading misconceptions, man!
Also, I'm sorry to whoever made the tutorial
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n8en0/tear_flags_explained/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=themoddingofisaac
but custom, that i made
yes
you mean tears that you spawned with Isaac.Spawn ?
Guys, how to add tear flag to custom tears?
?
i wanted the third parameter nevermind
i expected a number??
What is the second parameter "cacheFlag" to MC_EVALUATE_CACHE ?
pls nerf
oh it shoots brimstone too
that's cool
woow
or 6charge + something like 1 red heart damage
14 charge
cant stay op like that
thats cool ? whats gonna be the downside of this item?
WIP https://streamable.com/2r6dg
and in console type g AND THEN ITEM NAME
Under escape
key that is on the left
or `
press ~
g ITEMNAME
So my item just won't show up?
<@187282809457475585> as far as i know that's not possible atm
Quick question: After I make an item how do I setup what item pools it appears in or does it just automatically have a chance to show up in treasure rooms?
now it works, thanks a bunch!
or have a list lookup
yeah, alright
so really I should check if entities.[i] == for each one?
fix it with `if (entities[i].Type ==  EntityType.ENTITY_FLY) or (entities[i].Type ==  EntityType.ENTITY_POOTER) or ...`
I see
EntityType.ENTITY_POOTER positive number always returns true
what it does: if (entity type == fly) or (entity pooter) or
`if entities[i].Type ==  EntityType.ENTITY_FLY or EntityType.ENTITY_POOTER ...`
that includes continue
your logic is wrong <@120547369761767428>
```lua
function mod:newRun( )
--code here
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , mod.newRun)
```
not sure if that includes changing floors though
MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT  isn't it?
<@223869207748542464> how ? :p
only does it with the random chance, but it seems to ignore the check for entity type
does someone mind having a quick look at my mod code? For some reason it seems to heal regardless of the enemy I kill.  https://hastebin.com/qalalomaca.lua
yes
do we know to detect when a run is restarted ?
i don't know how to use them
someone posted about tear flags on the subreddit
idk, is tear flag even works
like with tear flags?
can I just make my tears hominh and piercing without making a new entity?
nevermind
?
Do I need to have the red tears? can I just keep those blank since I am not going to use them?
This one stays for however long you want it
But it won't stay if you return true
return true also works
BTW, guys, I figured it out `ply:AnimateCollectible(item, "LiftItem", "Idle")` http://i.imgur.com/gfDQHjS.png
anybody made an orbital in AB+ ?
Drawing a line between two points
what's going on here ? <@126590786945941504>
the weapon not the other thing
can someone send a picture of a flashbang
Unless you need something unique https://streamable.com/rgn40
copy existing .anm2 most similar to what you want to do -> edit animations -> duplicate if you need to add more
animation editor is alright though
Sei mai
the room editor is bad lol
go away jano
The only good thing about afterbirth+ modding
no man you got it wrong
Which is create new animation (file) -> import spritesheet -> create animation (name) -> add sprite layer -> insert frame
You just have to get the basic process
? when i saw the room editor i lost faith in the tools
i just used the editor it's amazing
The editor is great
GIMP is older than me haha
it's actually somewhat fun to do notepad animations but the editor probably works better
The tutorials have some mac screens, fair enough
I don't know if the website has any in general
I love how the gimp website frontpage has no screenshots
in notepad++
but
i did too
single window mode, though...
i did .anm2 animations in notepad before there was an editor
same reason why i use fl studio because i only use USER FRIENDLY PROGRAMS
gimp interface by default is cancer
<@71242588694249472> sup!
Unless it changed
Only true modders edit their sprites with notepad
Gimp's interface is hell for some reason
Paint.NET is like the friendly free editor
true
meme
?
also i use gimp but because i'm on linux
***OPENS NOTEPAD.EXE***
i couldn't get used to gimp the layout is weird but i use paint.net
*Actually*
literally anything besides mspaint will work
gimp is best
Oh no gimp
i use gimp
it's simple you'll see
If you can compile it yourself it's free
I use Aseprite ¯\_(?)_/¯
i don't care for the animation
paint.NET
png
so adding it definitely possible
*oh god*
<@!267112861921181697> the anm2 or the png
i've subtracted vectors before
how do I edit the Amm2 files png by hand?
i'm sure it has a Vector class lol
no it's in
That's something antibirth API needs
hence the facepalm lol
well it's probably possible in that too
Ah, that I missed, sorry
<@126590786945941504> Antibirth api
no
Did I miss something?
Which would be `Vector(vec1.X+vec2.X, vec1.Y+vec2.Y)`
?
No need to do anything like you described
well that's that
`vec1+vec2`
not sure how to make a proper one
Vectors can be added?
You do realise
mine would have to account for that
Just to be sure
yeah
you know how when you add more orbitals their angle adjust
yeah i know buuut
fairly basic
then rotated the vector a few degrees
i made a vector of (-120, 0), then every update i set the entity position (in this case a black fly as a proof of concept) to player's x + the vector's x, then player's y + vector's y
yes gud
i've done it in antibirth's api
hey guys! has anyone added an Orbital ?
is this good?
```<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
            <entity>
<entity anm2path="002.000_Flashbang.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="8" collisionRadius="8" friction="1" id="2" name="Flashbang" numGridCollisionPoints="8" shadowSize="8" stageHP="0" variant="415">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />
            </entity>
    </entities>
```
ok so
kk
alternate version things
oh
how come?
u need to change variant to ur own value for example 415
```<entity anm2path="002.000_Tear.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="8" collisionRadius="8" friction="1" id="2" name="Tear" numGridCollisionPoints="8" shadowSize="8" stageHP="0" variant="0">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />``` this is it right
done!
add effects
and find u tear by variant
scan for all entities
do it in code
custom effects?
but
oh
ur done
attach it to tear
edit anim in editor
for tear
copy code from isaac entities2.xml file
just copy paste the code from there and edit with anim editor?
so
to create tear like in entities2.xml of default isaac and add animation
then u can do anything with it
u need
so
Now what?
Made it
ok
yes
u need to create a file called "entities2.xml"  in content
shouldn't be too difficult
I basically just want to make an passive item that shoots out flashbangs occasionally that confuse enemies in a small radius of the tear
ok
I got 2 hours to spare because of two hour delay
Thanks
i can help you
Ill try to get someone to help me understand I guess
My Custom Tears
By someone I mean you di
but I saw someone make replacements?
not replacement
u can create custom tears and spawn them
I got a mention that it was now possible to make my flashbang tears ;-; guess not
I've got that list before with somebody saying "That one was wrong" or something before here https://hastebin.com/onovihirov.hs ¯\_(?)_/¯
Yeah
Lua 5.3 has built-in bitwise operators
https://hastebin.com/xaqudunuba.hs
But this list is useful
Not a great tutorial
That post is goddamn programmer gore
oh god
/shru That's... Not even stickied?
I'm guessing
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5n8en0/tear_flags_explained
tearflags has been around for a while and the information on the post there is a little weird
Which subreddit even?
Where's the sticky?
You can use TearFlags
Oh, I don't check the subreddit, let's see
and the reddit has a tear modifier post sticied
theres some post5s up above using them
I don't think they added anything like that, but ¯\_(?)_/¯
...
DID THEY ADD TEAR MODIFIERS
i can do a tear thing?

sprite fixed
indeed
I'd think you'll have to check for that manually for now :P
for example even if the last action included bomb placed, what gives you the bomb that you placed?
<@135254843567767552> What do you mean by that?
Oh wait, nvm, GetFireDirection will work for disabled controls
what in post_update would 100% of the time be the thing you're looking for?
<@135254843567767552> You just test in POST_UPDATE, as that gets called every game tick
It won't work properly if controls are disabled
the other action triggers could potentially be useful as well but they still have the unfortunate lack of a proper callback to get shot fired,  item dropped, bomb dropped ,etc
for up
like ``if player:GetFireDirection() == 1 then``
this will work
i mean, you can use it for that
``player:GetFireDirection()``
nah
This is what you use to know if the player is firing :o
```lua
ActionTriggers = {
    ACTIONTRIGGER_NONE = 0,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_BOMBPLACED = 1,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_MOVED = 1 << 1,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_SHOOTING = 1 << 2,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_CARDPILLUSED = 1 << 3,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_ITEMACTIVATED = 1 << 4,
    ACTIONTRIGGER_ITEMSDROPPED = 1 << 5
}```
`EntityPlayer:GetLastActionTriggers()`
I just realised
guys
Why is EntityTear.Height negative...
But is it a passive item that only replaces the player's brimstone?
it's alredy on modding of isaac
Because, well, I think I found everything I'd need to do it
How bad would a nyan brimstone mod be?
Guys
I guess I can just FireTear and then move it
indeed
But there's no way to cast to an EntityTear from Isaac.Spawn
eh
and it's not replacing the tear
FireTear does return one
My own code!

Is there a way to get an EntityTear yet?
bottled brimstone?!
TFW you get distracted when making a mod
http://i.imgur.com/P4SOA23.png
I MADE IT!
YES!
even better ,can you post that repeated error
which line
on the same line of code
there's a lot of errors
yes
not enough info, what doesn't work and have you checked the log.txt for errors
Still don't work

that HasParent function is custom code, let me get you the relevant lua

        end
    end
  end
end

pbb:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE, pbb.TechZ)
```
This doesn't work
i'm not sure if there's a way to force an entity to refresh after you change its variant or subtype, so replacing it asap is the only way i currently know
here's a quick replacement that isn't perfect but it's a start https://files.catbox.moe/myk58o.mp4 
```lua
function mod:PerfectUpdate()
    roomEntities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i,entity in pairs(roomEntities) do
        if entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and HasParent(entity,player) and not entity:GetData().custom then
            local customTear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 31,0,entity.Position, entity.Velocity,player)
            customTear:GetData().custom = true
            entity:Remove()
        end
    end
end```
no sorry it seems to return a copy of TearParams. wow
or is that no reference
cant you specify the variant in player:GetTearParams
but nothing worked
i tried
and save fire delay
i need to prevent isaac from firing tears
so
and Player fires tears too
Fire delay
without
soo
fires custom tears
yep
it works
i have that code
```
    if player:HasCollectible(techZ_item) then
          if player:GetFireDirection() == 1 then
            local tear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 65, 0, player.Position, player:GetAimDirection () * 12, player)
            tear:GetSprite():Play("MoveUp",1)

                elseif player:GetFireDirection() == 2 then
            local tear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 65, 0, player.Position, player:GetAimDirection () * 12, player)
            tear:GetSprite():Play("MoveRight",1)
            
            elseif player:GetFireDirection() == 3 then
            local tear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 65, 0, player.Position, player:GetAimDirection () * 12, player)
            tear:GetSprite():Play("MoveDown",1)
            
            elseif player:GetFireDirection() == 0 then
            local tear = Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 65, 0, player.Position, player:GetAimDirection () * 12, player)
            tear:GetSprite():Play("MoveLeft",1)
            end
    end
end

```
soo
hacky but works
you could find all tears, and replace them with your own, i guess
but tear delay
custom tears
if you explain what you're actually trying to do then i can probably give you an answer
like i can make it shoot
i feel like it is. im not sure.
sorry i havent done anything much with tears yet. But i dont think this is possible right now.
maybe tomorrow hwen people are alive
keep persisting. someone might get ya sooner or later.
anyone?
it doesn't even take effect
damn its really too bad that treasure map effect cant be done temporarly apparently
Guys, i am so tired, help!
How to make item that makes isaac fire custom tears?
haha woops i forgot i changed that
Your mod variable is called `ttmod`, but then you're trying to use `g13testmod` instead.
full code
```
local ttmod = RegisterMod('ttmod', 1)
local oculusinfernus = Isaac.GetItemIdByName('Oculus Infernus')

function g13testmod:use_oculusinfernus()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(
    CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_FIRE_MIND, 
    false
  )
  player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(
    CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_TREASURE_MAP, 
    false
  )
  
end

g13testmod:AddCallback(
  ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,
  g13testmod.use_oculusinfernus,
  oculusinfernus
  )
```
yet still it doesnt work
Yes.
in between player and Add right?
haha I guess. ?
Wait. Are you trying to do that without `:GetEffects()`?
wouldint it return an error if it was not the right collectible?
They are ids of the items though.
``player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(ID, false)``
Tried with the ID instead of the name ?
already tried
cuz ``player:ToPlayer():AddCollectibleEffect(`` to ``player:AddCollectibleEffect(``
probably
yes
anyone know why its not working?
Redundent or code breaking?
Isaac.GetPlayer() returns an EntityPlayer, so it's just not necessary
its something i saw on reddit for trinket effects I assume thats the issue
why player:ToPlayer()?
```
function g13testmod:use_oculusinfernus()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  player:ToPlayer():AddCollectibleEffect(
    CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_FIRE_MIND, 
    false
  )
  player:ToPlayer():AddCollectibleEffect(
    CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_TREASURE_MAP, 
    false
  )
  
end

g13testmod:AddCallback(
  ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,
  g13testmod.use_oculusinfernus,
  oculusinfernus
  )
``` 
no errors but effects not happening
ok
so i need to do that +-100000 to maxFireDelay too...
TemperaryEffects
oh
FireDelay is probably always handled the same way, but plenty of things change MaxFireDelay
the AddCollectibleEffect types
<@168775690152443925> like what effects?
is there is an item that sets fire delay?(in isaac)
how do i add collectible effects
seems drastic.
i just do -100000
so when i need real fire delay
not maxfiredelay
firedelay
and do -100000
firedelay or maxfiredelay
are you talking about
Current tear delay + 100000
ultra simple
i have a solution
DUDE
oh
fire delay for plr is set 999999
and
in 1 var
when i have fire delay
dude
stop
thx
check the firedelay flag
omg
oh yes
to 9999999 fd
every time cache is updated
and before updating the stats
oh that's easy
just i need to save current Fire Delay
probably wouldn't work in cases where an item was swapped though
thx
ok
entityPlayer:GetCollectibleCount()
you could look for changes in the return of GetCollectibles()
uh
¯\_(?)_/¯
like any item
?
guys, is it actually possible to do something when isaac pickups an item
you can make that default behaviour while using a positive boolean for it `brim.FollowParent = false`
And you can change the Parent from what I can tell
Not arbitrary locations
It's supposed to be shot from entities
Yes, because, y'know
interesting logic to have it follow by default and have a boolean to stop that
Just because a lot of the questions that come up for me are more general code questions than isaac related
```lua
                    brim.DisableFollowParent = true```
I think i need to go back and learn more about coding in general though :t
Actually
hmm then i probably can do it
how do I write the add termperary effect?
brimstone entity is probably set to follow player so you'd need to use positionoffset unless it's not the players brimstone
i think i got the idea too..
Oh
brb got the worst idea I could get
kinda related but I wanted to move the brimstone position but it doesn't seem to take that.
I wonder if you could change the sprite of a brimstone to make custom beams
lol
Jump off a bridge or something
idk
I should just go, and
After the way you typed Go
I'm sorry
you can't stop me.
goLANG is cool as well!
js and Actionscript are also languages that I know but they're not as good. c plus plus is neat
*THY SHALL NOT WRITE THE HOLY NAME WITH INCORRECT CAPITALS! THE NAME SHALL BE Lua!*
*BLASPHEMER*
I love lua ?
I see
ouh I thought you meant people getting interested in modding thru those
oh
<@223869207748542464> ComputerCraft
Yes, script kiddies showing off the code they copypasted from the internet is sad
dude, i thought minecraft made in java
sad?
So, uh, maybe it's not the right community, but it's very much probable that more people know Lua than C++
AKA Roblox and minecraft
Also, Lua's pretty popular in a pretty sad way
anyways thats just random personal feelings about the modding
I know basic coding stuff but never really got to do things and isaac is a neat way to see my code do stuff lol
You'll either have to include a compiler and compile every mod when it's downloaded or risk nasty shit being included in the compiled files
I have to say I like the modding just because it's the first game that I was interested in modding
oh dude
Good luck running C++ as a scripting language
Also
You don't need any ;
<@200718741116420096> i make mods, NOTHING CAN STOP ME, ALREDY 3 DAYS OF MY LIFE IS SPENT ON THIS BS PROGRAMMING LANG
what would you recommend?
I would not recommend ur first experince with lua to be afterbirth+
Lua is a very strange language, i still don't know where to place ;
I have to agree Saxarok idk why he didn't use c++ since more people understand it than lua
but still it's better than nothing
rip edmund
well
Could be better.
i would like godly language(c++) API more
doesn't seem to be done by people who know what they're doing
it''s pure bs
What are u guys's opnion on the modding lua API?
well what do you want to do to the tears?
for one of my items
cuz i cant pick items from item pools
to create array of devil deal items
i was forced
i know
most things you do will be weird ways until they actually improve the api
but it's kinda weird way
it depends exactly what you want to change about them though
the other one you can just find tears that are owned by him and change them into something custom if they aren't already
i know
they're both possible, you could actually keep track of your own custom firedelay based on the characters maxfiredelay without any problem while keeping his real fire delay at 9999
like arrows
pressing shoot buttons
like not spawning tears
and only if he is shooting
in first i am spawning custom tear with tear delay of player
oh i see
like i said 2 ways
if you stop isaac from firing then there won't be tears to change into custom tears
any solutions?
but 2 doesn't work
in second i am changing the isaac's tear to custom tear
in first i need to prevent isaac from shooting without changing the fire delay
like a tried 2 ways
?
how to make isaac fire a custom tear
guys
just the effect
that looks really cool though
yeh i dunno lol
huh
i don't really get it
here's an example of a changing tear height and the effect it has https://files.catbox.moe/r7tjn6.mp4
hm
Why is this not working? Can anyone help?
local MyMod2 = RegisterMod("Mechanic's Wrench", 1)
local Wrench =  Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Mechanic's Wrench")

function MyMod2:UsetheMod()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local room = Game():GetRoom()
  local pos = EntityPlayer.Position 
  
  Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_POOP, 0, pos, false) 
end
MyMod2:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod2.UsetheMod, Wrench ) --Call Back
but it's doing some weird stuff
FireTear returns an EntityTear which has a Height attribute
hm I actually have a sloppy idea but it might work..which would be temporarily changing the player's tear height and then changing it back
I tried slapping a Z value after the x and y but that doesn't seem to work unfortunately
Hopefully someone van help ya
Welp its 5am, im gonna have to go.
Is there a way to override an entity's appear animation?
Hello, is there any way to change tear height with FireTear? I want to spawn tears but i want them to use isaacs current tears
but the upload is empty and its hidden
it kinds of upload
Thats what i did
Line, delete XML, open Isaac and rety the upload
i want to figure that out before adding the xml
i can't upload it without the xml
Give*
You could use lua to vive the item at the start instead of the xml
Hmm
hmm
i generated another metadata
no
and used the same metadata
you only removed the xml
without the xml
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839858228
hmmk
can you try uploading it kyo?
ill try without it
i want my guy to hold spear of destiny
the xml nope
does the mod work without the xml?
xml files like that need to be in content
it can't be in there
yeah
sending it again

is players.xml inside resources?
yup
is it working as it should?
i did lol
delete the content folder, i don't think you need it
hmm
Why is
room:spawnGridEntity(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE,0,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
not working?
yup
is the mod inside the ab+ mods folder?
i get this: Failed to upload mod 'marksman': Error (9) - File not found
what's up?
<@266032468853915650>
<@109624258317033472> room:spawnGridEntity(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE,0,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
Doesn't Work
Failed to upload mod 'marksman': Error (9) - File not found
i really have no idea why it happened honestly, i figured index would work and was using it for a while, then that happened and i lost faith in it
AKA player index, not entity index
Ohhh, I see, I think the player's Index might be a different index
player was 0 and a little white spider shooter was 0
i get this file not found error
Didn't it happen after the original entity despawned?
i don't understand why
<@195368190333812736> use room:spawnGridEntity
index has been 0 on multiple entities in the same room before
Like I said before. thank yuo so much
no
Wouldn't just the index be enough?
erm
```lua
function CompareEntity(a,b) -- Checks to make sure the Entity being referenced is the right Entity
    -- IF the type, variant, subtype and index are all the same, it SHOULD be the Entity we're looking for
    return a.Type == b.Type and a.Variant == b.Variant and a.SubType == b.SubType and a.Index == b.Index
end
```
Is there a reason why:
    Isaac.Spawn(GridEntityType.GRID_PRESSURE_PLATE,0,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
Spawns Monstro?
alright
oh was a compareentity in there? let me grab that too
<@135254843567767552>  Qestion: what is CompareEntity doing? is it just if entity.Parent==parent then return true?
im still getting error :/
looking good
... Makes sense. Thanks
For example, you might want to spawn a familar from the player, but make it parented to another entity
The parent is, well, the actual parent, which isn't always what spawned the entity, at least AFAIK
Sure
Do you know how parenting works in engines and shit?
Well
What's the difference between parent and spawner?
...what?
scayze, i hope you have just woken up, for  your own sake xd
No problam. maybe you should look at brother bobby or ghost baby for reference
thanks!
<@266032468853915650> You need to off set the anm2. make the bottom part of your sprite near the center of the anm grid
looks like its SpriteOffset/PositionOffset isn't correct
how do i gert an entity to stay above it's shadow? lol
No, I wont post someone elses code. But really, thank you. I didnt know about HasParent or anything
i don't have an won't get a reddit account but it's not secret code so feel free to post it if you want
<@135254843567767552> Maybe it should be posted on the subreddit as a tutorial. I imagen others need help getting the tear
open isaac again?
now it says file not found wtf lol
thank you so much

oh
i must agree to the updated terms for the workshop
i think i found the issue

it didnt do that before lol
it didnt have that before lol
I don't tink so lol
there is an empty slot? lol
is it normal that before my character
lmao
caps lock is a key i use a lot for my pixel software lol

golden poop i mean
ahh okay
<@195368190333812736> forced is like u have poop and u are trying to spawn gpoop on it's cords, if true gpoop will replace poop, if false nothing will happen
Oh ok
also that
```Isaac.Spawn(GridEntityType.GRID_ROCKT,0,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)``` for grid entities
Thanks whats the Forced true or false?
<@195368190333812736>  ``  Isaac.GridSpawn(TYPE, VARIANT, Vector(0, 0), FORCED_TRUE_OR_FALSE)``

Can someone give me a template for spawning Grid Entitis
try to up this


ok
too hard to find it just by talking
umm can you get me the mod folder? i'm gonna see if I can fix this and the explain what's the problem
now it doesnt work lol
don't lol
<@266032468853915650> not only it
im going to cry
eyy it's russian dude that likes acchi kocchi
hi ;D
yes.
should my folder be on the folder for mods?
still the same D:
run moduploader as administrator? idk
yeah it does
let me double check
the mod works as intended hen you run isaac?
seems normal to me
ah
there is no - before metadata the browser adds that btw
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

-<metadata>

<name>mark</name>

<directory>mark</directory>

<description>yay!</description>

<version>1.1</version>

<visibility>Public</visibility>

<tag id="Graphics"/>

</metadata>
```
what are the contets of metadata.xml?
yes
do you get that error when you try to open metadata.xml with the mod uploader?
ok
character_001_isaac
what's the file you're trying to replace?
yes
does it generate a metadata.xml?
yeah i have it the same
this is how the mod internals should look like

yeah lol
<@266032468853915650> ever uploaded?
you're goin gto have to ask someone else. I havnt uploaded a mod
Failed to upload mod 'mark': Error (2) - Unknown error
is it normal that i get this
it wil generate a xml once you do
ye but it asks me for a metadata
first run the game and see if the mod works
moduploader
and how do i upload it to the workshop lol
you're done lol
what next?
alright
and it will replace the game's original art
hmm ok so you want it to be in the same location and have the exact same name as the one inside resources
yeah i guess
like greenisaac?
yes!
>like, replace te original art?
anyone knows how to upload gfx for a character that already exists to the workshop?
hey
lol k then
Doesnt matter
Problem solved!
yeah
is it just not spawning
Can someone help this Im trying to spawn a card but its not working
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_TAROTCARD , CardSubType.CARD_HERMIT ,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
Not totally happy with the colors.

I'll have to test it when my movies over.
ENTITY_PROJECTILE would make it make more sense.
I thought that as well. but that might be for other things
It should I have a function that detects all sins bosses and doesn't have anything that specifies the variant, but it still effects super sins.
Enemies fire ENTITY_PROJECTILE, don't they?
That's really strange.
thats why it dosent detect them
yup
Blood tears are just Variant 1 of ENTITY_TEAR
while things like brother bobby shoot normal tears
I think its because all enemies shoot "blood tears"
Weird?
its very strange
Nope, just Isaac and his buddies
Any tear in the room at the moment of the check.
Yeah and all tears that enemies fire as well.
You can use just ENTITY_TEAR but all buddies tears will also change
Yeah I need to change the color of one of my tears too. Also make it explode, and arch in the air. I just can't figure it out.
yeah. I just dont know why they told me it works, showed a vid of it working, but then precided to not put any code
I think that's one of the busier people though.
ilise rose was the one who tried
someone already tried to help but didnt post any code. So I think they didnt actually do it
Ask some of the smarter scripters
alright. thanks for trying to help
Yeah I don't know then.
I'm not spawning the tears
not for your qestion
yup
<@150336707609231362> I don't know why its not working, are you spawning the tears you are trying to edit?
Also is it possible to make all the doors in the room close if you spawn an entity like Greed?
rip
Currently impossible w/ mods. Unles you edit the one in the game files
Also do any of you know how to add an item to an existing Transformation Pool?
Cool thanks
Yez
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED ,1,0,door.Position, Vector(0,0), player)
so greed, 1, 0
No the number before that.
type, variant, subtype
So that?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED ,0,1,door.Position, Vector(0,0), player)
Sorry the variant and its the second value.
The one after ENTITY_GREED?
what one is the sub type?
Set the subtype to 1
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED ,0,0,door.Position, Vector(0,0), player) 
how to make that Super Greed
which is isaac
GetPlayer is looking at ENTITY_PLAYER.0
enum      EntityType {
  ENTITY_NULL = 0, ENTITY_PLAYER = 1, ENTITY_TEAR = 2
0 represents player one in this instance since your asking for parent that's also why you put a 0 at the end of player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
but tear.Parent returns a userdata. also 0 represents ENTITY_NULL AKA nil
I use 0 and it works fine for me.
Try 0 instead of player.
Hay! i just finished a custom challenge if anyone is interested http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839790323
every tear returns soemthign differnt
just tear.Parent dosent return the player ent
Its not failing at all
Oh okay so its failing at the parent check right?
but I dont and it easier to use ZeroBrane to see where its failing if everythign has its own if
If I had this code working it would be ands
I spaced then seperatly to its easier to read and edit
I know
If you are getting those entities they should all not be nil. Also you can put an "and" in between each check instead of 3 if statements. For example ``` if 1 == 1 and 1 ~= 2 then ```
to make sure an entity is valid
Why is ``` if entities ~= nil then ``` in there?
what about that?
https://www.lua.org/pil/1.3.html bottom of the page.
https://hastebin.com/laqefeqewo.lua I've tried it with the entity player. every tear's parent returns soemthign different
eh
Just comment out that stuff with --[[ (code) --]]
hang on. its full of junk testing stuff
Code?
all I want to do is get Isaac's tears
<@150336707609231362> is it supposed to be the parent or are you trying to modify a tear shot by something else?
<@116386733905412105> Yes
<@135254843567767552> How did you get the tear stuff working? The tear parent for me is not the player
if they have the achievement for it?
like
Also is there a way to check if the player has unlocked an item
<@168775690152443925> Pre existing
well alright
believe it
no way

It's Hella Jeff actually.
that's sweet bro
Haha hella  jeff

thanks

Thank you, gonna credit you, if my mod is ever going to work
http://i.imgur.com/ryPfcZT.png Here's the actual image if you want to use it.
But i realla like your attempt
I would have drawn it myself but i kinda didnt know where to start
What do you mean diseases?
I think it looks really good.
I know what you mean
Not my favorite.
The problem with these kind of items is you can't really draw most diseases as an icon.
Actually not that bad
<@174505132292046849> I tried.
Like to a pre existing one or a new one?
Anyone know how to add an item to a transformation pool
i went with "How to lose weight" but i don't really like it actually
how does the game determine what room models to use for a room
What do you mean?
seems like a proverb i don't know....
anyone know how the game decides what to make a room look like?
but
this will be a weird question
*"It'll cost you an arm and a leg!"*
you could make the pickup slogan
that's a cool idea
yo
oh damn i just noticed my mod is on the 1st page of the workshop xd
<@155169558121021440> i wanted it to randomlz shoot limbs while firing, each time giving you a speed up, until a maximum at which it also grants you ability to fly. Speed and Flying would reset every room
sup
Ayeverybody!
Just set it to true if you don't want problems.
as it does not actually grant any consumables when picked up
althoug 1-up is an odd one to object
it may depend what kind of item you are trying to grant
Well, when I tried 1-up, it didn't work when it was false.
the third argument can be true or false, they both work
<@!182509747835109387> that isn't true
and have a chance to cancel incoming damage
maybe it could work a bit like infamy
hmm
what would it do?
leprosy sounds like an interesting item
then where's the number of boms at?
if the number of coins, keys, and hearts are available in the entity familair class
waitasecond

Anyone need sprites for a mod?
<@195368190333812736> For passives, just set the second argument to 0, and the third argument has to be true for it to work for some reason.
What's a good item pool (editor or no editor) for rebirth/afterbirth
AddCollectible (CollectibleType Type, integer Charge, boolean AddConsumables)
Question:

cool
fancy some horfball anyone?
https://gfycat.com/SoulfulFaintAdeliepenguin
Oh, there are no costumes with only 6 sprites.
I guess I'll use a costume with only 6 sprites as reference.
I used Bob's Curse as reference, so I'll overlay the costume on Bob's Curse.
yay mario
thank you ?
before calling EvaluateItems()
when you later decide to manually update the stats, you will need to manually AddCacheFlags()
Oh.
so if you don't need to update those stats on pickup then you don't need those cache flags
<@174505132292046849> the cache flags will say "update these stats when this item is picked up"
Finished my first mod! Check it out here:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839738836
There's no ID for either of them.
because I think it will just auto-add your costume for you when the item is acquired
if i make an item which doesn't affect stats on pickup but later, do i still have to add the cache flags to th xml?
but I would think you want the costume's id to match the item's id
it gets assigned an id
Does the item need to have an ID?
This is the code effected:
```lua
if player:HasCollectible(smbmode) and collecteditem == false then
    local smbcostume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/smbmode.anm2")
    player:AddNullCostume(smbcostume)
    collecteditem = true
  end
```
Are they formatted properly?
Well, I uploaded the anm2 and costumes2.
how would we know lol
What is the exception?
caught exception, writing minidump
fancy as hell
Basically finished with this now.

Is there anything wrong with my anm2?
Now the game crashes when I get the item.
trudat
Oh, I think I needed a double equals.
if condition then
ERR: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/smb mode/main.lua:6: 'then' expected near '='
then you either got an error.log problem or a logic problem
well, I did all I could
It doesn't crash, but my item doesn't work anymore.
?
Let's see if it doesn't crash this time.
<@!182509747835109387> https://hastebin.com/ihodimigel.lua
lol
thx
and
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
yes
oh
you probably didn't define entities
oh <@223869207748542464>
<@154701703474577408> So is the first part part of the item function?
whihc I did not want to provide :P
thx
nice
oh
means you tried to get a value from a table that doesn't exist
and costume of item isn't aplied
the call to that function is inside a much larger function
indexing a nil value
<@!182509747835109387> that's why I said "I call this every update"
when i fire tear it doesn't change
no
And...the game crashes when you start a new run again.
attempt to index a nil value - what does it mean
Unless the first function is supposed to be part of the item function?
And it just gives you the costume automatically if you do.
<@154701703474577408> You don't call apply_costume though.
yes
oh
the log.txt is in the one without the word mods
yes
and there's one that's that plus Mods
there's a folder that is Binding of Isaac Afterbirth +
so in My Games
dumb question - where is log file?
just don't changing the tear
for example, your file may be in the wrong location
your log.txt probably says what's going wrong
sax is it crashing or what?
collected_ii is just a variable I am using as a boolean for "did you change costumes yet"
theres probably a more efficient way of calling it than every update but after getitng it working, I ended up removing the costume again because I didn't think it was necessary
What is collected_ii?
let me check again one sec lol
like it's ur code, but edited
that line is commented out
you just sent me my own code
oh
```XML:  

<costumes anm2root="gfx/characters/">
    <costume anm2path="Monstro.anm2" priority="99" type="none" />
</costumes>    

Main.Lua:

Called every update:

function monstro:apply_costume()
    if (collected_ii == false) then
        local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/Monstro.anm2")
        Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(costume)
        collected_ii = true
    end
end

function monstro:init()
    if (Isaac:GetFrameCount() == 0) then
        collected_ii = false
    end
end

monstro:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, monstro.init)```
ur code isn't working
try type="none"
soo
but didn't add the casting function for Entity to EntityTear
<@116386733905412105> type="passive" crashes the game.
basically, they added the EntityTear class
unless they added it sometime in the last like 4 hours
idk
<@223869207748542464> they haven't added ToTear() yet have they?
I added a costume, let me just dig up the relevant fragments out of my code
and type="passive"
I think id just needs to match your item's id
and a question <@116386733905412105>  
why this don't work?
```
    if player:HasCollectible(techZ_item) then
     for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                --local entityTear = entities[i]:ToTear()
                if entities[i].Variant == 0 then
                    entities[i].Variant = 65
                --      entities[i]:ChangeVariant(65)
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/Boomelaser_tears.anm2", true)
                    sprite:Play("MoveUp", true)
                end
            end
    end
```
so in your custom costume
Yes.
that's the code for the belt
i just made the sprites haha
<costume anm2path="028_The Belt.anm2" id="28" type="passive">
    </costume>
we used some "Lua magic" to add costumes
Because none of the Isaac items have a costume=""
I don't think there is.
but there is an xml flag somewhere
yeah that's wrong
let me double check on that
so in your items.xml I think you just set costume="#" or something like that
eyes
oh
<@116386733905412105> Yes.
neck item
is your costume attached to an item <@!182509747835109387> ?
its a hat
Your item
How?
that limits one item costume per mod
i know without lua modding
hey icerzz you managed to use costumes right? Pissy needs some help with that
nice
yep!
is it the techarang tear?
my custom tear poof
So nobody has added a costume yet?
sry then
welp
well i haven't come to using costumes myself i am just reproducing what i read in that reddit thread
Now the game crashes when I start a run.
could you explain how it works <@174505132292046849> ?
addnullcostume still says it takes an item id
Okay.
again, try using AddNullCostume() instead of AddCostume()
let me check the documentation
AddCostume probably takes an item and tries to add that item's costume
oh
Error in PostUpdate call: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/smb mode/main.lua:6: bad argument #1 to 'AddCostume' (Item expected, got number)
Nope, it still doesn't work.
Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("smbmode.anm2") is what I'm suggesting.
instead of "path/to/filename"
so like "smbmode.anm2"
it might already know the path since that's defined in costumes2.xml
That is the filename.
try just the filename
uh
Should I try backslash instead of forward slash?
gfx/characters/smbmode.anm2 is where the anm2 is though.
Oh.
doesn't match the path you just gave me
so Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/smbmode.anm2")
\resources\gfx\characters\costumes
<@116386733905412105>  did you get my dm?
It is.
the file has to be located in the right location
It could not find costume.
It is.
make sure your png is 32-bit by the way
which would suggest an issue with your png or anm2
so if you see that line, you know that that bit of code happened
it probably says "giving player costume (Blah blah blah)" or something like that
try player:AddNullCostume(smbcostume)
no error but it may have clues as to what is happening when you attempt to give the player the costume
No error
melon
<@145740433165647873> what's the item called?
check your log.txt
now that it's not crashing
The costume doesn't work though.
https://gfycat.com/BriskCreativeFalcon
xml is pretty finnicky about formatting iirc
well there you go.
The game didn't crash this time.
I Don't know if it matters
before the >
basically just put that slash at the end
Oh
for all of the arguments
right args is a placeholder
<@116386733905412105> There is no <costume args>
<@158075746143698944> here is my code that I used to hack in my artwork for my player tears:
```        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                --local entityTear = entities[i]:ToTear()

                if entities[i].Variant == 0 then
                    entities[i].Variant = 33
                    --entities[i]:ChangeVariant(33)
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
                    local anim = "RegularTear" .. math.min(math.max(math.floor(entities[i].CollisionDamage), 1), 13)
                    sprite:Play(anim, true)
                    -- DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH WUBWUB WORM
                end
            end
        end```
<@!182509747835109387> in costumes2.xml
In which file?
<@116386733905412105> How do I get it to show my custom sprite and animation?
instead of <costume args>
but do <costume args />
not sure if this matters
entityPlayer:FireTear(arguments)

friendly
<@158075746143698944> is it a friendly or enemy tear?
can I see your costumes2.xml?
Could anyone help me get a custom tear to spawn?
This is my anm2 file.
This is my code:
```lua
local smbcostume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/smbmode.anm2")
  player:AddCostume(smbcostume,true)
```
are you a liquid
like me
its fat
is that bird a liquid
did robobaby just appareact
might chance the color between the two bars
^ that's an awesome idea
update, still a wip
I'm gonna need to see your code
In isaac-ng.exe
Third try. is this clearer now ?
Runtime error
what's the crash?
The game crashes and leaves no error.
There's nothing there.
pissy did you check your log.txt?
And it only works for transformations
wow
ay lmao
Yes, but it's too confusing.
wasn't there a reddit thread about that?
Because I did everything with the anm2 and costumes2 files.
So how do I add a costume so that my game doesn't crash using Lua?
quality jokes
that's better
?
don't post my nudes
?
you never know with  melon
I doubt you reverse enginereed Isaac when you have access to Kil's version.
how to do something using EntityTear? In current AB+ API
?  i made a music mod for anitbirth but never released it
did you ever think of that?
maybe I did it all by myself
Because people were asking "OMG HOW DID YOU MAKE IT?"
You can't make that with the current tools.
whats your point though
if you say so...
It's obvious.
ok
says who?
You made the console, but you're using Kilburn's version of Isaac.
yeah melon made it lol
I think I remember coding this console
i think
just lua moddable
are you sure?
not open source
oh
It's Kilburn's, not yours.
melon console
hey guys.... what does afaik stand for?...
We get it. You have Kilburn's open-source version of Isaac.
<@145740433165647873>  What is this console?
https://gfycat.com/EsteemedIncomparableChafer
It's not working for me.
How do I add a costume?
so.... how to do something using EntityTear?
rubber cement 2.0=
lol
OMG WOW
https://gfycat.com/CostlyInexperiencedAlligator
oh...
right?
the icon in the upper right is supposed to highlight one room of the map... i think i have to redo this.
guys, i have a ULTRA stupid question - how to do something using EntityTear
right?
but it should be the other way around
have you accidently swapped the symbols for 2 and 3? because to me t looks like 2 would reroll all pickups on the floor while 3 would not
I don't know what the square with the line in it is supposed to mean
map item?
looks like a map
also @ people who answered: what do you think the icon in the upper right on 2 should be ?
I really like #5 actually
aahhh
<@174505132292046849> how would you display the therm "floor" ?
<@174505132292046849> the lines are the rooms on the map
<@!174193097285173250> loops pretty nice
alt: the binding of isaac title screen with the arrows symbol over it :P
i dont get how 5 is supposed to mean "restart floor"
you could just put all the dice from 1-5 on six
but it wouldn't be very helpful if you didn't already know what those do
just two and three are kind of hard to read
what is a symbol for everything ?
actually six is fine even
and not multiple specific ones
I think for #6 you should use a symbol for "everything"
but the rest are good
and obviously, six
on two & three
I think the pickup icons are pretty hard to make out
I like them
cool
Second try on the carvings for dice descriptions. what do they say now for you guys ? ?
and see if it works
but try with "none" anyway
actually it probably shouldn't crash if you entered "passive"?
give me 1 sec
That's so stupid.
just leave type as "none"
Oh.
I was trying that myself
fucking with the type makes it crash yeah
ahhh
So I don't do type="passive"?
a problem for me because I want to make a custom character and the menu is just blank when you are in the select screen
I think menu stuff like that menu & pause menu are not replaceable through xml yet
mine are all just the eyeball for now
custom MY STUFF! icons I don't know about
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhxv3/tutorial_how_to_add_and_use_custom_costumes/
did you do all of this?
What about custom MY STUFF! icons?
oh here it is
there was a reddit thread about how to set the custom costumes properly and I followed it for my mod and now I can't find it again to link it to you
And I put the sprite in resources\gfx\characters\costumes
I put the anm2 file in resources\gfx\characters
So I assume the API is truly broken and you can't?
I put costumes2.xml in the content folder.
I tried adding a costume, and the game crashes on startup.
Is is possible to make a set a sprite for your items for the MY STUFF! section
Oh duh
no, just change variant to my tear variant
bye
gotta go guys! cya tomorrow
change variant to null?
<@!129339380090404864> i'm a bit late but good sprite (although not done) as always ?
change variant!
oh
i will check it
idk
Nothing in the new EntityTear thing for you?
would be too complicated for soemthign o little
ok
nvm
?
make a replacment for it
nice! RoboBaby!
and i need to keep fire delay
set the fire delay up massivly
like new brimstone item
i just need to disable isaac tears, my item will replace them
<@174193097285173250> As someone just incompetent enough at Isaac, I'd assume: Reroll Isaac. Set the room on fire. Set the floor on fire. Crap on the floor. Re-roll isaac's stats. And some combination of those for the last one.
<@!129339380090404864> doesn't work
ha
CanShoot=Nah
not that we currently know
no other ways?
hmm
set the firedelay to 9999
teardelay over 9000
how to prevent isaac from firing tears
whats up?
guys
just an idea though
interesting
maybe a strength card will make it go to the top no matter what
Oh, no.
i thought u are saying that it will be scaled with ur damage like hush
what did you think I ment?
oh
the more damage you do when you active it the higher it will go
<@150336707609231362>  i don't think so
in what sense?
should be damaged based
no idea how hard it would be to make that though
probably just a slot machine, though I like the idea of it having a certain # of health, that is restored every second and gives a prize if "killed"
I have an idea of what it will do though
what is it going to do?
yeah
strength test?
that looks gun
thoughts?

?
I said want for a reason :p
I know its impossible now
wait no I didnt mean litterly
like in what polls is the item
i think transit was working on a *super* hacky way of doing custom floors but never finished it
or something like that
D:
like to get item devil price...
impossible
I want to be able to make custom floors
ok, i want ability to get item properties.
Really? <:isaac_surprised:245063314873253888>
lol
<@!129339380090404864> ok thats what i wanted to know. you guys can change the future of the game by complaining to me NOW ?
no items :c
!items
?
<@66197463593136128> holy shit this is great. i should start pressing more  about buttons
okay Ill try it
maybe
they are in items.xml sooo
yes, i think
Can you remove a Trinket with that?
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:RemoveCollectible(COLLECTIBLE)
<@!174193097285173250> I wouldn't know what 2-4 do based on those symbols.
so how do I do that?
yes
<@223869207748542464>  Was that a yes towards me?
You have found **3** item(s).
!items
i dont know, ive got bucket of lard and some others. i dont think one can do much with it ^^
what i need to do with that?
wow
You have found **1** item(s).
!items
yes
also does anyone know how to make an item disappear? Like a one time use active item?
yes, told about that to Icerzz like 4 hours ago <@66197463593136128>
<@223869207748542464> Thank you
fun time
hey guys, go in to the animation editor and hit "about"
```
Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position.X
Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position.Y
```
``
Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position
``
or
or
``player.Position.X``
``player.Position.Y``
One
Reroll yourself
```
player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player.Position -- POS OF PLAYER
```
like GetPlayer
@ inHere: I have to make "Dice room descriptions" more unspecific so edmund implements it into the game. i had the idea of "carvings" made by isaac that describe what that dice face does. here are all of them on one image. can you guys say to me (without looking into the wiki of course) what those icons might want to say ? ?
i just saw that they share some functions
<@158075746143698944>
Game is totally different and has all important informations to access everything else
Isaac is an namespace, not a class and serves mostly for getting some basic things running.
hey, what is the difference betwenn classes Isaac and Game?
Anyone know how to get the players x and y position?
let me kill him
where is he
whoever the other guy is needs to die
I dont think there will be this year :c
there's more than cerulean?
xD
THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND
Wait fuck, different Cerulean
Oh hey Cerulean
will there be another battleblock theater run? always enjoyed stampers commentary
yeah probably. ^^
yup, pretty awsome. You missed a few cool spots though
<@150336707609231362> holy shit that DOOM playthruogh was sick
It'd just be a lot easier than storing two different entities and trading stats between them for spawning between rooms.
of course you can spawn all entities
why do yuo need to do that?
I have no idea
Is it currently possible to place a stored entity in the game or can we only spawn new ones?
so cool
<@!129339380090404864> wow
D:
lol
I waited too long and now the DLC isn't on sale anymore.
OOoo

that's kinda cool
that LuaJIT is linked on lua.org/about.html
wow I just realized
I've been modding isaac since rebirth
and yes I know about anm2s
Yup
nice
so there was no point to my move-animations.b-into-animations.a-then-unpack-then-move-back business
anything that has a anm is an amimation
rip
gfx/.anm
I'll never pin it, not ever
yup
does it? in `gfx/`?
i have all the .anm2 files
yeah
it does unpack the animations
someone got OCD over here
it doesn't even unpack animations.b for you
also the afterbirth+ tools/ unpacker sucks
<@268036083827212290> chill dude ?
seriously can we get this pinned plox
instead of modifiying the real files, you just put your new files in your a new modfolder
"Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". Please do not write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua" right!
*Lua
Oh yeah it is
i just wanted to know, i think i can work the old way, someone over the subreddit told me that if i don't need to use LUA (something that i have no idea how it works). then the process should be the same
<@207632937338798081> I'm not to sure, what do you need from it?
damn i missed so  much
np ;3
thanks for telling me ?
they have been since monday
how cool is that!
i completely missed that
SHIT they are online right now?
just 1 more thing, is the help section in moddingofisaac.com useful? cuz i have no idea if stuff has changed since the new modding support came out
they are doing Doom 2016 rn
watching Awsome games done quick
soo, what are you guys doing right now?
xD
I feel your pain
well, atleast i found it ^^
god damnit
i defined 3 different states to 0, 1 and 3 and not to 0 1 and 2
what was wrong?
and it was so obvious
oh no
they are easy
ive been trying to find a bug for like 3 hours
i fucking hate myself.
np
well... that's awesome! thanks dude
yup
'ResourceExtractor'?
inside the game files inside tools
where?
wait. really?
AB+ has a resource extracter
wait, why?
so? any clues? do i need to download a new unpacker?
should remake a few antibirth items in AB+
i still need to edit some of the new files of Afterbirth+, since my mod is a Rupees for coins mod. and i need to change dad's coin sprite and other new sprites. especially Ultra Greedier
Afterbirth to Afterbirth+
ok thanks for the help, I think I'll stick to 4 now and see how it goes. I need to get better at balancing items xD
you mean from rebirth to afterbirth or from ab to ab+?
guys, i need some help, i want to start porting my mod to Afterbirth. how do i do that? do i need a new unpacker or something like that?
3 charges if u want, but i would still keep 4 or even change it to 6
make it a 50 second recharge
i just know ab+ soo
oh
you probably have to ask in <#205854501083545601> or sth ^^ here are the people who do not really play ab+
or 6
4 charges
^ Link to workshop if you wanna see, thanks! ?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838222609
Hey, I was wondering if you all could suggest a room charge for my item. It spawns a friendly portal, which was pretty op originally so I got a lot of 6 (and a few 4) room charge suggestions, but since the portal nerf in the last patch... I am really not sure what room charge it should be. I am considering writing it from scratch to be how it used to be... but at the same time, having it act like the other portals in the game (just on your side) was how I envisioned it so maybe I should keep it nerfed. Pls suggest a charge time, I really don't know ? (Portals now spawn between 1 and 5 enemies then disappear)
new item... CONFIRMED!
shit. i tihnk youve got yourself an idea! ?
AND DEAL DAMAGE!
he will throw random emoticons ON ENEMIES!
RoboBaby doesnt react to butt anymore? shame.
butt
lol
and throw random emoticons at you
i think i need to add RoboBaby 2.0 to tboiabp. He will talk to you.
i cant really concentrate when i hear voices in the background, im just listening to music all the time.
or I fall asleep while listening to NL play ab+/ab-
robo baby why gun
I just listen to NL play in the background
Those random emotes get me everytime xD
lul
RoboBaby knows what up. maybe.
wut
0 runs
I've done  3 runs and now I'm just modding
same
i only know that everyone hates them ?
same here
fun fact: i havent played a single full run aaof AB+, only sticked to modding for now. Hvent even encoutnered Vis Sissters yet
<@223869207748542464> started a poll:
``` vis sisters still need a nerf```
according to the poll, the poll apperently is still broken ?
wow
oh
<@223869207748542464> started a poll:
``` poll works?```
i dont actually need the function, just stumbled across it ^^
He's right, ya know.
what the fuck RoboBaby
dunno.
Does it return a table? Could be returning the position and velocity of each shot.
<@109624258317033472> some objects just aren't bound to lua at all
the fuck is the PositionVelocity
the docs are weird
> PosVel EntityPlayer::GetMultiShotPositionVelocity
... so What does it return?
?
>best language EVER (c++)
ok 6 charges
that turns the item balanced
Some item data is obviously in items.xml
or a shitty item
So you can get a great item
<@195368190333812736> The code for the items is compiled into the executable
You can use it anytime
Its a risk
<@132569939969179648> but what about bro the bobby?
ah okay
i think they are Best language EVER(c++)
<@195368190333812736>  u cant do it
anytime
Because you can get great item
Are the items from the game coded in Lua? Because I would really like to look at some of them
maybe 6 charges and 2 hp containers
take 1.5 hp containers and 4 charges!
Or...
Or use it once and done
I would rather just hope for devil deal
the dev has spoken. so be it.
Then it's basically useless then
4 ch take 2 hc
Fun, but broken
It sounds super broken
Tbh tho
Plus you couldn't spam it 24/7 with batteries
<@124248443383185408> dude, i wanted this item to be what it is now, so.... no
So you got risk (taking 3 full red hearts of damage) and reward (getting a devil item for that room only)
And you'll never go below 1/2 a red heart if you have soul/black hearts
Red is taken before soul or black though if able
Don't loose containers but just take 3 full hearts damage
That sounds fair
To use
8 charges it is? ?
Take 3 hearts of damage
1 room method
what about making making it 4 charges and take 2 heart containers no = <:poo:230363864724799488> yes = <:plum:259939492008296448>
So I wouldn't say it's useless if it lasts one room
Plus Leviathon
that is very true. it will give you Guppy eventully
Because you can have dead cat with you for 1 room but it would still count towards transform
Plsu also chance at free guppy without having guppy so
will be 6
I'd love to have a chance at Death's touch for a room for easy clear
nah 8 is not supported
How would the item be useless?
<:plum:259939492008296448>
12 charges, give all devil items for that room <:plum:259939492008296448>
<@124248443383185408> item will be super useless
but still, i voted for 8, that could be intersting
Why not just make the item last one room?
its not ?
?
idk
can things even have an 8 charge? is that supported?
ok go with reactions 8 is <:poo:230363864724799488> 6 is <:plum:259939492008296448>
damn
if bot is online...
like !poll question
xD
`it doesnt`
how does !poll even work?
I'd go with eight though.
?
oh.. <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
!poll 6 or 8 charges
by per room I mean it activates for that room then you lose it when you leave that room
2 hearts would be fair
ok
because why not
should damage you for one heart
like bobby the bro
trying to use it without red hearts
also
<@!129339380090404864> still impossible to get item devil price
There's a lot of shitty items in the devil room pool tho
would be kind of hard to track it though
per room?
but gives you 3 random items
would be cool if it was a 6 charge and per room
it should take +1 of the original devil price
idk
or it will take 2 hc
maybe i will do 8 or 6 charges
yeah, thats kinda OP
3 charges
for 1 heart container
like u can get random item from devil room pool
lol
unless it's per room
<@223869207748542464> that's kind of OP
Room only thing?
Big thanks to <@132569939969179648> for sprite!
``Isaac.Spawn(5,100,ENUMHERE,Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position,Vector(0,0),player)``
since it also added Entitytear
use enums
<@195368190333812736> dude
I shall call this update the "Tear update"
yeah, hopfully. Really glad they fixed this
familiar tears probably won't since they would have the familiar as a parent
spawn a familier and see if it changed there tears a swell, thats something it was doign while I was testign about
maybe
I was testing it a while ago and it didnt work
this must be a recent fix
https://files.catbox.moe/0sutoy.mp4 called on all entities that are ENTITY_TEAR and have the player as a parent
Im so bad at this
This still doesn't work
Isaac.Spawn(5,100,Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Bum Friend "),Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position,Vector(0,0),player)
so its not the player
all. I've done a lot of testing. they return soemthing but It differnt for every tear
jacob, what kind of tears do you fire that don't have the player as a parent?
Thanks
normal brakets
not square brakets
Rip
Isaac.Spawn(5,100,Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Bum Friend "),Isaac.GetPlayer[0].Position,Vector(0,0),player)
Didnt work what did I do wrong?
So using parent to detect tears dosent work and the player entity has no child. I guess you can detect when a tear spawns and if its realy close to isaac, then it must be isaacs tears, right?
yeah
`Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Bum Friend")`
for this it will work like that
Oh
Brimstone
like
item name in isaac
No
Will that work?
Isaac.Spawn(5,100,Isaac.GetItemIdByName("BUM_FRIEND "),Isaac.GetPlayer[0].Position,Vector(0,0),player)
if you detect a tear it grabs all friednyl tears on screen
for the tears, that is
Oh yeah, you can always check if they're from the player
Parten it not the player
Should work
<@150336707609231362> Check if the parent is the player entity
``Isaac.Spawn(5,100,Isaac.GetItemIdByName("ITEMNAME"),Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position,Vector(0,0),player)``
<@195368190333812736> That's Better
Well, the tears are an entity but I assume that if you try and do it that way, it detects all tears on the screen?
Well, I think with that Gummy Flies idea I'm sort of tapped out on item ideas
Anyone now how to detect only Isaac's tears?
to ground
Okay thanks
``Isaac.Spawn(5,100,Isaac.GetItemIdByName("ITEMNAME"),Isaac.GetPlayer[0].Position,Vector(0,0),player)``
Provided the item you made already exists in the game
But that gives you them directly
Though console also works
oh you want it on the ground?
With lua, you can spawn them on the ground when you start a new run
then use the method Saxarok just gave
On the ground
Through Lua I want to give the player Bum Friend
spawned on the ground? directly into inventory?
through lua? through console? through xml?
``player:AddCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName("ITEMNAME"), 0, true)``
how do you want to give them to isaac?
Anyone know a tutorial to give isaac items
ok thanks, I'll give it a try ?
just any ID, someone on the forums said that only free IDs under 1000 work. i cannot vouch for it tho.
yeah
Can I make a new enemy that isn't based off any exisiting enemies? If so, what do I set the entity id? Just a number that isn't currently being used?
nice
Yeah I think I got it
<@195368190333812736> a variant of GRID_POOP i assume
but i'll check again
I don't think so, I checked that
<@218390040928059392> isnt the a gfx change?
you can't increase isaac's health while he is dead
my issue was calling Revive() *after* adding hearts, instead of before
in case anyone else tries to do things with lives
yep
ah!
<@218390040928059392> you want it to say something other then basement right?
https://twitter.com/Narx221/status/818946283582783488
<@109624258317033472> What about golden poop I dont see it in the documentation
I think Revive() just wasn't working because something was broken elsewhere in my code
Player:SetFullHearts() doesn't work but that's easy to just code for myself
Yeah I see thanks
but its kinda self explainatory if you look at the docs
room:SpawnGridEntity(room:GetGridIndex(Vector(80,80)), GridEntityType.GRID_ROCK, 0, room:GetSpawnSeed(), 0) <- snippet from my code
Damn Im gonna have to figure out how to spawn grid entitys
<@195368190333812736> depends. there are different poops. The poop from ie. Flush is an entity yes, the normal poop is an gridEntity tho
<@268499778990637057> it sure is possible
Is Poop an entity?
has anyone added or does anyone know if it's possible to add a new type of machine in the arcade?
It would've just been win/win for everyone except whoever is making the API
If the API was good, it wouldn't have taken too long to make the Afterbirth+ items in the API instead
If the API wasn't good enough, missing features would be added to the API to allow required functionality until next issue arises
Then there would be loads of examples for modders to look at and use when trying to make a mod
I can understand why they haven't just released everything... but the latest patch changed my mod quite a bit so I am not sure if I should just go with the flow and leave it or try and make new enemy behaviour from scratch somehow xD haha
but not _too_ good testers
the best testers for an API, are people trying to make the content using it
for api and game
they just should have had good testers
nah,
afterbirth+ entirely should have been modded in and released with the source if it was to be a proper api but it didn't happen
they should definitely have made some if not all the ab+ items with the API
it probably doesn't work 100% based on your conditions, but shooting an enemy definitely kills isaac
> the enemies weren't coded in lua
I can only imagine how much better the API would've been if they bothered to make Afterbirth+ using the API
```lua
function mod:EntityTakeDamage(entity, amount, flag, source, countdownFrames)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if source.Entity.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
        player:Kill()
    end
end```
works fine for me
When he hits an enemy
pissy, your callbacks function signature isn't correct to begin  with, can you explain when you want isaac to die?
They could release the C++ at least.
good point, I didn't think about that ?
There isn't any Lua they could release
we can't directly access anything about them
Exactly
the enemies weren't coded in lua
...dude
No, because Nicalis won't release the code for the enemies.
hello ? So until this point, any new enemies i've made have just been new entities based on existing enemy id's with the sprites changed (and/or base hp changed or anything that can be edited in the entities2.xml) but is there a way to see/edit an enemy behaviour in more depth and actually read what the different ids behaviours are?
<@135254843567767552> What's wrong with this code?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Onan's Streak EXTREME",1)
local instantdeath = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Instant Death")
function mod:death(dmg_target, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and dmg_source == 0 and player:HasCollectible(instantdeath) and dmg_target:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
    player:Kill()
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG,mod.death)
```
i've got player:Die() on an active item use and i put player:Revive() in my post update callback for reference
I will experiment more I guess
in my mod it does nothing, hmm
i dunno what you guys are on about lol
and Revive sure brings me back
and :Die()
player:Kill() sure kills me
but I'd like to hope otherwise
it might just be that Player:Revive() does nothing and that once isaac has died you can't stop it I guess
nope
<@154701703474577408> Is there an error in log.txt?
Because both player:Kill() and player:Die() don't work.
I think some of the functions are messed up.
Hmm... weird.
I guess I don't know what "Revive" does
<@!182509747835109387> didn't help I'm afraid
Player still gets the item, but that wasn't the problem, the problem is the "you still die" part :P
It should say where the error is.
double check, do a search for syntax even
in the log.txt
Mine just said there was an error
the error i got in my log.txt file was `[INFO] - ERR: ...My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/test/main.lua:593: syntax error near ','`
Oh wow
i removed the two parenthesis that needed to be removed, ran the code, and got a golden chest right away
Is there a debugger somewhere or do you have to self debug?
I mean, it *is* giving the player the item, but I will try and see if that helps
you have syntax errors, the code shouldn't even be running rubble
In player:AddCollectible
which third argument?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LOCKEDCHEST, 0,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1),Vector(0,0),player)
It's weird.
<@154701703474577408> You need to set the third argument to true.
<@223869207748542464> Any idea why the chests not spawning?
you get the new item but the player still dies
```     if (player:IsDead() == true and player:HasCollectible(item_rematch)) then
                
        player:SetFullHearts()
        player:AddBlackHearts(1)
        player:Revive()
        player:AddCollectible(item_ii, 0, false)
        player:RemoveCollectible(item_rematch)
    
    end```

this doesn't work as I had hoped it would
has anyone done extra lives before?
remove those
hmmm
Still works but good point
Good point.
Yeah idk why
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED_GAPER ,0,0,door.Position) <--THIS , Vector(0,0), player);
Oh I see
Yeah where?
this tingy
)
what do you mean>
WHat is that braket after door.Position?
I dont know how to do it otherways
```
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED_GAPER ,0,0,door.Position, Vector(0,0), player);
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED_GAPER ,0,0,door.Position), Vector(0,0), player);
                        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED_GAPER ,0,0,door.Position), Vector(0,0), player);
```this
There was an error running the lua file: C:\Users\NAME/Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/greed guide/main.lua
eh
you should check the end of your log.txt because there is some stuff there that might just be throwing errors
<@135254843567767552> The chest still isn't spawning. Couldsomeone maybe check why? http://pastebin.com/HwY26NP6
I'd check but I'm busy right now
it crashed on linux before but not on windows
EntityPlayer::FireTear
try using FireTear on the newest update
someone on linux?
Oh you so but it's the number correct? Thanks <@135254843567767552>
Ohh I thought you HAD to have a sub type
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LOCKEDCHEST, ChestSubType.CHEST_CLOSED,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
I have this
```lua
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LOCKEDCHEST, 0, player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
```
still can't spawn that chest huh
How does one spawn a Gold  Chest?
oh cool
https://twitter.com/Narx221/status/818933405492609024

idk xD
where?
codez
how to change level name?
odd thing to obsess over
xD
im sorry okay
haha
x2
lol
That should be stickied everywhere tbh
""Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". Please do not write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua" right!"
lol
https://www.lua.org/about.html
>LUA
sorry xD
Lua*
touche
thx <@134478547795443712>
c# is close to java
LUA is close to C# huh
GetMaxHearts()
Why this doesn't work?
``      if  player:GetMaxHearts ~= 0 then``
TemporaryEffect won't work for you?
there needs to be a way to force an item's effect without having the item itself
<@96016391173332992> Out of curiosity, what was the consumable you made?
my keyboard of 7 years or so still works  perfectly
the hell have you done to your keyboard oO
Oh I mean just a flash decompiler would do it
maybe but why?
It's a pain in the ass. I'd share my code but my keyboard broke and I need to get a new one to log in
flash isaac, i mean
in games root folder under tools
yes
Just saw my mention. Yeah, you have to add an entity and manage it 100% inside your mod
is there a resource extractor for vanilla isaac?
check the isaac modding reddit
you might wanna look at some basic tutorials first
i have done very slight scripting for new vegas mods
do you have any programming knowledge?
<@205152595507937281> what do you mean what do you do it in?
ok, but what do i do it in?
its exausting
I have never actually used the API I just have seen a bit of it being used
player:HasCollectible should be smart enough... hopefully
maybe?
if you wrote a MC_POST_UPDATE for the new item so only when you have the new item the code runs
the code might still be running if u only set it for one time check
then d100
If the player picks it up
u response to scayze
<@140945681182359552> what about them?
my idea for a small "starter mod" was to make the peeper item spawn red tears from the eye socket like in original Isaac
?
what about d4 / d100
in lua, check if the player owns said item, and than do some cool ass stuff in your code
Make a new one that functions the way you want then write a script to replace it when
how?
<@109624258317033472> that's unfortunate about the minimap thing
you can add additional features to an item tho
damn
you cant really edit an item
theres nothing to open
They aren't in lua iirc
like i dont even know what to open
how do i edit an existing item?
total noob here, but i have a goal and a question
and adding it to the minimap and stuff migh even be impossible
also, saving the pposition of the drops between changing rooms
if thats a list you can even add to
i think the harder part would be getting it to drop at the end of the room
npnp ^^
Thank you both, I was unsure since no matter where I looked I couldn't find an answer.
<@230188282829471744> yes, but i think that could get tricky. <@96016391173332992> managed to do it. i dont know if the mod is up on the  workshop yet tho.
it would just have to increment a variable and delete itself on collision with isaac
i dont see why not
<@126590786945941504> https://hastebin.com/ekaxegabis.lua wanna help me? there must be some really dumb mistake in that code. reverseDirection() is constantly beeing triggered. and i just cant figure it out
Hello, I don't mean to interrupt, but is it possible to add a whole new consumable type that's not a heart, key, coin, or bomb? (Or heck is it possible to add a new heart or coin type even?)
xD
It's not everyday that I can make such a great type
Thanks, it means a lot
congratz ^^
AKA I made a typo and didn't notice when proofreading
I've encountered the ID-10T error
oh, of course, I know what happened
hm
the xml looks good. hm
I can spawn it fine with the console
```xml
<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
    <entity anm2path="demonbottle_swirl.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="0" collisionRadius="0" friction="0" name="Demon Swirl" numGridCollisionPoints="1" shadowSize="0" stageHP="0" id="3">
        <gibs amount="2" blood="1" bone="0" eye="20" gut="2" large="0" />
    </entity>
</entities>```
wanna show us?
Nope
sure you set up your xml file correctly?
oke thank you. and um, probably when it cannot find an entity with given name
`nil` evaluates to `false` in logic tho
ok thanks
No
follow up question, since im not familiar with lua, is nil treated as 0 ?
Anybody would happen to know why would `Isaac.GetEntityVariantByName` return `nil` for a (presumably) valid entity?
theres nothing more indepth ?
I was hoping for a more indepth writeup but I guess I can DIY that, pff
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5n425j/aftebirth_20170109_update_b185_unofficial_patch/
What changes to the API were made in yesterday's patch? Can't find anything on either of the subreddits
so do an if then for framecount?
oh yes
otherwise the function will trigger when someone continues his run
also, check in the newRun() function for Game:GetFrameCount() == 0
```
function MOD:newRun( )
--code


end

MOD:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT ,MOD.newRun)
```
oh dude)
how do i reset a value on a new run?
like pupula duplex
and i need to rotate my custom tear
pupula duplex has texture facing up
i will try
ok?
<@223869207748542464> Sprite.Rotation?
like just rotate the texture in game
I haven't done anything with tears yet
how to rotate tear?
soo... anyone?
also the frame delay thing works
I have this too:

```function monstro:init()
    collected = false
end

monstro:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, monstro.init)```
how do i go about resetting a value only when i hit a new save?
that's true, I was doing that in another function but forgot to mention it
Noted, i'll test your code, thank you !
at the start of new run u need to reset it
(also it would be better to check collected == false before player:HasCollectible)
not at the start
you would also need a collected = false variable at the start of your code, to track if you have already changed the costume or not
Does anyone know how to rotate tear
currently inside the update() function that my program runs every frame, I have the line:

```if player:HasCollectible(my item's id) and collected == false then
    myitem:Trigger_Costume()
    collected = true
end```

something like that
Thank you ?
I see
I am using a costume in my item I'll just find how I called that...
currently your lua knows "if I am told to do Trigger_Costume then this is what I will do" but you have not told it to ever do that
Is there any other way to get list of all collectibles/max id?
creating the function isn't enough, it needs to be triggered somewhere or that code will never run
>_<
well there is your problem :P
<@154701703474577408> never, i was thinking that i just named the function who follow. I'm a bit lost in the "documentation" on what to use every time
Eh...
you wait until they put it in properly
How am I supposed to use the `config` class?
Using both `Config` and `Config()` gives an error :frowning:
where is this function called
you created a function, Trigger_Costume
checking right now
does modulo in lua not work with % ?
did u have ur texture at correct path
<@154701703474577408> i did not understand your question, sorry
also new room
oh
<@223869207748542464> already at the top of the file sorry i did not mention that
yep
reskinned azazel

<@81035468866584576> when are you calling that function?
<@81035468866584576> 
```
local reno = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/reno.anm2")
```maybe add that
or atleast proper guides on item making
has anyone made modding tools for complete lua peasants like me?
Hey guys ! I'm trying to trigger a costume when a desired items is took, i wrote this :
```
function mvModpack:Trigger_Costume ()
  if player:HasCollectible(ToujoursDebout_item) then
    Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(reno)
  end
end
```
But it does not seems to work, any tought ?
it should do that really rarely
reverseDirection() is constantly getting triggered
im going crazy. is there any dumb mistake in my code? https://hastebin.com/oxowirubuf.lua
actualy sorry, i was about to say how, but i forgot
how?
<@154701703474577408> i know how to add extra lives
wait is only set if something occures and that something has failsafes so it cant occure more than once the check however id in an MC_POST_UPDATE so would that be fine?
because if it's every update, before checking it, wait will never = wait +5 :P
it depends where you are setting "wait"
actually it wouldn't
but
it looks like it would
Would this create a 5 or more frame delay?
```
wait = room:GetFrameCount()

if wait+5 <= room:GetFrameCount() then
```
Is there a way to prevent Isaac from picking up a consumable besides setting that consumable's EntityCollisionClass to `EntityCollisionClass.ENTCOLL_NONE`?
hey it sure does work
which is fine
yeah they do
i didn't realize temporaryeffects even worked
how do you check if you enter a new room?
but
maybe i can just remove the entity
hmm
but
so they only last one room
to call temporary effects
theres a class
temporary effect how?
otherwise I'm going to try to hack it myself by checking IsDead() and using Revive() but it'd be useful if someone else had covered the ground already
has anyone tried using the API to add extra lives yet?
to be a temporary effect
i want the entity
actually
how to set my custom item so its a temporary effect
and last question
hmm
well you could wrap the GetFireDirection in a function call if you want
I haven't tried
ffs
It doesnt make sense we cannot check with a function whether the player is shooting or not
Nope
<@126590786945941504> have you figured out what the init function is
you can check GetFireDirection for things that aren't -1 i suppose
Dont worry mate
i was just asking
xD
Yeah dont worry
I need to focus on making the mod
I'm out of this
Oh dear
...
it didnt work
but
GetAimDirection ~= nil then
i tried
GetAimDirection
GetShootingJoysticvk
but GetFireDirection, maybe
dont worry
oh ok
or are there any functions on player class?
I haven't tried the exact code
checking the tear entities?
how xD?
Yes
Any way to check when the player is shooting?
Guys
Is there any reason to be afraid of Swift? ~~other than bragging about and pinning antibirth stuff~~
Oh god Swift is here
The only thing I see is GridEntity:Init ¯\_(?)_/¯
Level
<@128874748041101312> What class tho?
how you doin
hey guys
Update() doesn't wrok
where's the init function
it says `for SetStage/SetNextStage to have effect, call Init afterward `
check the value of that int
you know with setstage
increase an int every update
is there any way to put a delay between doing one line of code and then another?
well, thats funny!
Well, it won't return anything if I search seed :/
I just know it's possible
look in the docs ? not sure
But how do I get the seed of the run?
That might work
Hmm..
maybe you should set the seed to the run seed or something
no idea
just call next one time before
try next()? not sure
hm
yea
```lua
local myMod = RegisterMod("NewChar", 1);
local spit = 0
local spito = 0
local RNGg = RNG();```
Outside functions
where did you create your rng object
but when I restart the game and then start new run I get the exactly same numbers
then the're shouldn't be a problem I think
I mean, at the start of new run
difficult then
hm
yeah
Well I'm just gonna wait
are you trying to get a random number directly after the mod loaded?
Any way of fixing this?
RNG is giving the same combination for `random` after restarting the game
Emm...
There is a way: make it properly
One last thing. There is NO way of making it work?
*Poof*
To hide my embarassment
Gonna go to my void kingdom
I cba to explain it to you, sorry
Whoooooops
But XBagon
I didn't say that to you
Just sent through private message?
it's known
but ids are like 112 and so
Oki
Like I said, I can try if you give me the files
¯\_(?)_/¯
what am I doing wrong?
Kube, could you then explain how some of the downloads are different from others. I'm not the most keen on such things
And Ids are generated during runtime
```lua
local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/HotHeels.anm2")
player:AddNullCostume(costume)```
```xml
<costumes anm2root="gfx/characters/">
    <costume anm2path="HotHeels.anm2" type="passive"></costume>
</costumes>```
But jokes aside, you can't add items by name
"There's no stupid questions, there's only dumb people" *~KubeRoot 2017*
to add the modded items to them
actually allow us to edit the item pool
but wouldn't the "item pool editor"
wow... im so dumb i just copy and pasted straight from my function
stupid question here
At second ot last line
`.sinsbossdrop`
I mean
<@168775690152443925> It's `.`
Guess I gotta play legit
Welp...
Darn
You can, if you hack around it, but it won't work
```
function thesevendeadlysins:sinsbossdrop()
  local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
  local room = Game():GetRoom()
  local gluttonyspawnattempt = false

    if groomattempt ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and
    gluttonyspawnattempt == true then
      gluttonyspawnattempt = false
      groomattempt = nil
    end

    for g1 = 1, #entities do
      local ge1 = entities[g1]
      if ge1.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_GLUTTONY and
        e.IsDead() and
        gluttonyspawnattempt == false then
          gluttonyspawnattempt = true
          for g2 = 1, #entities do
            local ge2 = entities[ge2]
              if ge2.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and 
                ge2.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE and 
                ge2.SubType ~= truebookofsins_item then
                  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, truebookofsins_item, ge2.Position, Vector(0, 0), nil)
                  ge2:Remove()
              end
          end
      end
    end
end

thesevendeadlysins:AddCallback(
  ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,

I cant seem to get this to work i want to spawn a specific item instead of the normal gluttony drop
Or, well
You can't upload mods that you put in the game folder to the workshop
Nuuuuuuuuh
You just editted the built-in xmls
<@205725838275117057> That kind of mod won't work with AB+ style modding
Also
Nothing
I have
I just joined
¯\_(?)_/¯
I can try if it you provide me with a costume
just tried it and it crashed
same question xD
how do you make an item with a costume?
I know is  cheap
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2706/all-item-pools-are-one-with-0-charges
Do give us the link though
Mhm
or u don't have one?
Did u tried to delete ur existing metadata.xml file??
And select metadata.xml
You have to open the mod folder
I have a link to the mod if needed
So pretty much to recap. I am trying to upload a mod with the Isaac mod uploader. But when I press choose mod and look for the thing I wont upload it doesn't appear
<@205725838275117057> what is ur problem?
Nevermind I'll give it a go
One problem
Hmmmmmmm...
Create the metadata.xml yourself
If a mod doesn't show up
Erm
I wont give up!!!
Anyone else?
Darn
Then I can't help you Rainon :/
Okay well this is about as good a video as I'm ever going to get https://twitter.com/samiam1616/status/818893334315929600
Some mods wont show when I try to choose them in the Isaac mod uploader
It's a bit further up

<@205725838275117057> depends on what's the problem, I haven't seen it
***why***
`Player.Player`
Also, how do I make an explosion that doesn't deal damage?
Using `Isaac.Explode(Vector(320, 400), Player.Player, 0.0)` isn't working
Filmos do you think you could solve my problem?
Thanks!
and then you just can use RNGobj:RandomInt(max)
instantiate a RNG object outside of any method
I'm trying to figure it out, but without any results...
How do I use the RNG class?
Nyyyyyyyuuuuuuuuuuuh....
hey guys, any updates?
Thank you !
I see what were my errors... kinda. I'll try to read more Lua tutorial, too ?
I know I know. It's cheap as f. But as long as it's a solo game it's not cheating, it's just experimenting
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2706/all-item-pools-are-one-with-0-charges
If you'd like to try then it is this one
It seems even using their names doesn't do much
Oooooh
```lua
if math.random() < 0.05 then --5% 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_DIME, pos, Vector(0,0), player)
    elseif math.random() <0.25 then --25% 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL, pos, Vector(0,0), player)
    elseif math.random() <0.50 then --50%

    end
```
*Leaves for the void keeping a sharp eye on everyone*
Then I'll just hide in my void hole until someone comes around
Yeah that could help to check on a working code to learn the right way, i'm kinda lost >_<
Darn
i've only uploaded one thing without any errors so i'm probably not versed enough to answer it
Haven't had any success with uploading to the steamworkshop for some of the ones that do appear. I get the Error-2 Unknown
hmmm
Yes
it doesn't properly populate the tool you mean?
keep on trying blacksheep, if you get stuck i've got working code you can check out
As in when I choose a mod it wont appear
Thanks <@135254843567767552> tryng to make this work ?
So I am having a bit of trouble with the ModUploader. The things that I am trying to upload wont get registered as possible
ask away cooper
may as well just draw the length of the line underneath its center point no? wouldn't have to be so rough
*Checks to see if it is possible to ask a stupid question without breaking conversation*
ah
It's supposed to be a thing I can use to draw a line with a simple function **and** get a rough distance estimate at the same time
Roughly
is that supposed to be a ruler?
Woo new development tool https://streamable.com/rgn40
there are plenty of separate RNG's you can get from different classes in the game and RNG:RandomFloat() will get you a float
as for generating random seeds, you could be using the RNG class in the api
you also probably have your coins backwards since you'll be spawning significantly more dimes than pennies
Game should be Game(), you're using SubType where Variant should be, Game() requires 2 more parameters
blacksheep there are a few issues
How am I supposed to generate random seed then?
Wait, why isn't `os.time()` working?
Is that correct ?
```
function mvModpack:use_LaBouleMagique( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )
    local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position, 50)
        player:AnimateCollectible(player:GetActiveItem(), "UseItem", "Idle")
    if math.random() < 0.05 then --5% 
      Game:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, CoinSubType.COIN_PENNY, pos, Vector(0,0), player)
    elseif math.random() <0.25 then --25% 
      Game:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL, pos, Vector(0,0), player)
    elseif math.random() <0.50 then --50%
      Game:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, CoinSubType.COIN_DIME, pos, Vector(0,0), player)
    end    
end
```
I'll test, thank you !
`if math.random() < 0.05 then --5% elseif math.random() <0.25 then --25% end` i guess?
How could i declare a chance to realize an action ?
I want to be able to do something like, when this particular item is used, 
5% chance to do this, 25% chance do to that, 50% to do that, 75% to this.
do we have the ability to add rooms yet ?
let's see
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("test",1)
mod:SaveData("foo")
Log(mod:LoadData())
```

kinda thing
I come from C++ so an idea of dynamic objects being used as keys gives me conniptions
it's just poorly designed, but it's referecing the table that you get when you call RegisterMod
is that a customary thing in lua
but why is the key a fucking table
mod:SaveData() takes a string and mod:LoadData() returns that string...so if you use strings...
okay well...
which I'm not sure is possible atm
while playing the hurt animation
<@182519885669072906> you have to add a callback on MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG for the player, and then do some magic to not deal the damage the traditional way and instead subtract it directly
and some explanation on (save/load)moddata
like MC_ON_ITEM_PICKUP
I may need some help on the modding side tho
it's so annoying, you can already do so much shit with the API but a lot of very obvious stuff  is still missing
welp
rip in rip
rest in peace
I asked how to detect multiple copies of the same item bc I had an idea to just add an item with a small all stats down every time you took damage
but then i guess that's also lost
if you subtracted the value it was when you picked the item up from the total calculation it could
wouldn't work if you had taken some damage before picking up the item
does the function Player:GetTotalDamageTaken() persist? i've never checked if it's what you could want
it's pretty weird, i can't tell how it would affect gameplay
I have an item that gives a small all stats down every time a damage is taken, and currently use PEFFECT for that, but that doesn't carry over quitting and continuing
But is it a good idea tho ?
I even have the sprite
i'm not 100% but i think we have control over those things in workaroundy ways
yusss
as for your red heart soul heart swap idea five, that seems rather doable
there are these strange savemodata functions but i have no idea what they do
yep, that's my pickle
Mhhhhh, so ?
not incorrect, i still haven't figured out how to save mod data
that would work, but would probably break on quitting and continuing, right?
you could do some hacky workarounds like removing the item from isaac but marking it as collected internally so that it can be collected again
Kamikaze, razor, blood rights, plan c to name a few
pretty much, yea
and since there isn't MC_ON_ITEM_PICKUP I cannot increment a counter to just multiply an internal counter every time I pick an item up
so in other words you want to be able to track how many times you've picked up the same item
Might just have to avoid the bad items though...
Is this possible to do ?
**Shark Fin**
*Attrayance for blood - Trinket*
You take red heart damage over soul heart damage and you lose chance for deal with the devil by getting soul heart damage
I know but I just think it'd be fun if it could be any effect but still safe to the player
in MC_EVALUATE_CACHE I set the stats after `if`ing for whether the player has the item, which doesn't work if I collect an item and collect it again
<@187282809457475585> the easiest is really to make a list of items that only have positive effects
Ok I had another idea where the sprite is even already done
I know this much, but
I'd like people to actually use this item, not be scared of activating plan c
keep track of all the stat bonuses you want and re-apply them on MC_EVALUATE_CACHE
Hmm, I'll have to figure something out then fpr the harmful ones. Hopefully I won't have to cut them out
how to change stats with passive items in a way that stacks with itself
player:UseActiveItem--if it didn't crash me--would probably do what you wanted with a hardcoded list of positive effects
that sounds a little out of reach right now based on the api cliff, but let me check something out
the tricky thing would be using the players inputs to navigate the map in memory to select which room you want to go to, getting them there should be easy
I'm trying to make an active item similar to dead sea scrolls, with the exception that it can call up any active item effect, not just vanilla Isaac items (similar to the April fools challenge) and any item that would cause self harm would not hurt the player. Anyone know how I can make the item call up any one of the active item effects and also how I could adjust ones like Plan C and Kamikaze to not do their self-harm effect?
maybe
for the teleporter
you could make it a hole and use the hole animations
ok, thanks!
Vector.X, it's gotta be capitalized
Sorry for this stupid question, but how do I get x variable from vector?
that doesn't seem terribly farfetched
hm hm...wonder if that's possible with the api how it is
I want it to be smooth enough
idk yet
it'll open up the map
room*
to teleport to any cleared toom
and how would you choose
you can choose
no
Well, I finally finished that new item of mine up thanks to the help of a few people here
teleports you randomly to any cleared room?
I was thinking about enter the gungeon room teleporter but not bad
Not bad
i can't help you coding but i would make the item like a pidgeon mount in reference to pokemon where you would use your pidgey only for flying ?
But I can't do lua
I want it to be kinda mine cuz I want to do the design on it
I don't really want to tbh
<@182519885669072906> maybe post the idea on reddit and someone will do it
someone ?
just get basement renovator
ez to do
plese, some one can create a synergy lab mod for afterbirth +?
but something
idk what yet
or i'll do something
plz do not steal idea
every "white" room on the map
You can teleport to any room you finished
It's an active infinite use
Still need idea for name and sprite
what is ur idea
and
I had a great idea but I'll need someone to help me with modding
ok, thanks!
you Isaac.DebugString() and check the log.txt or RenderText them
Or how I print them
I know, but what numbers are those?
Room:GetCenterPos() should give you that
Does anyone know what are coordinates of center of standard 1x1 room?
i just wondered because no other mods i've looked at are using it
but i'll use os time from now on
weird
when shooting
no it's called several times
use math.randomseed(os.time()) before your call
is that code running once at the start of your run / script?
and a is always 2
i simply wrote "a = math.random(4)"
typing on a tanlet is hard
it shoildnt generate the same thing
<@174505132292046849> Post code that generated the same number every time you ran math.random
does math.random behave diffeeent?
so it does behave differently in the game?
:3
yeah, i didnt say  it was a high numbwr
So you should use that for any game mechanics in your mod
That's seeded based on the run seed
if you want integers use math.random(from,to)
There's a built-in RNG class
But generally
also math.random() generates a number between 0 and 1
well i did not try the function in an mod in game yet, so sry if that was a dumb question
Not in a loop
Oh, I thought ever time you run the code
even if unseeded, it shouldnt give the same nubmer over and over
Depends on where you run it
By default it might be unseeded
You didn't seed it, did you?
unless you're reseeding it right before generating a number it should be based on time
math.random() does give ypu a random number
lol
thats not very possible. whats your code?
always
like it's always generating the same number
nothing will, but plenty of things in this game are seeded anyway so it's probably good that it is seeded
doesnt it generate random numbers for you?
l learned it that way
well
why?
i thought math.random wouldnt generate true random numbers?
thanks man, see you on the leaderboards
OH SHIT, i just realized that my very last daily i did i was #8 in time ?
and this completes my changelog:
```
Rooms:
in Utero: Blastocysts room fixed (entity 74 ? 76)
in Greedmode Depths and Womb some spawns were moved 2 units
```
i had a few toptimes, but in never was better than #150 or so in score ^^
sweet! youre a fucking god
xD
aw ok no money then, but yes
europa breaths top scores, would die without them
probably not ? i only just realized.. "europa... i know that name!"
that depends, am i going to win money
Oh, europa, I knew that avatar was familar
<@85037568210518016> are you the one that is always in the top positions in the Isaac dailys?!
negative to be behind them, mess with the number and see how it works
the larger the magnitude the more offset from the players position it will be
Okay that works pretty well, thanks. Also, why is it *-16?
somebody was asking for room diffs yesterday, there you go https://github.com/eur0pa/IsaacAfterbirth.XML/tree/master/rooms
tmi
i fuck what i made
and when i find a way to do something
pretty much. as you get more intimate you'll find better and better ways to solve the same problems basically
yeah xD
you seriously spent more time fixing bugs than actually writing new code
well. solving problems basicly IS programming, so id say you do pretty well if you manage to do that ?
Im not a programmer xd
in random ways
so i just solve my problems
in my case i dont know how the fuck to do half of the things
And that's goddamn infix parsing
My old damn calculator is just 195 lines
I mean
this is not easy for me xd

im trying hard
my project is just 100 lines, but hey, just two items
erm
to be fair, 300 lines are autogenerated, they dont count ^^
Oh, pacman thingy
Is it an "add 100 items" type of project?
the pacman one
What is your project?
my project is curently at 900 lines of a huge fucking pile of unreadable shit

you are a hackerman
you always solve the problems changing the position of entities
scayze xD
<@130188705498529792>  fireBrimstone returns an Entity. Change the position of it
Like, normally it looks like this if Isaac moves to the right http://i.imgur.com/L27oE8l.png
Opposite movement, which I've figured out but it just looks kind weird starting from isaac's head all the time
<@130188705498529792> sorry, didnt read the docs my bad, ignore my answer
do you want it to shoot out opposite movement or opposite head
That doesn't work exactly, it's only firing off at a single angle now no matter the movement direction
in player:FireBrimstone
<@130188705498529792> do player.Position + v
Based on how the player's moving currently, for now I'd just like it to always appear to be from the back of his head
how do you want to offset it samiam
<@150336707609231362> hmm it doesnt work xd
Like, here's the code I'm using right now to try and offset the brimstone so that it's not always starting from Isaac's mouth (commented out partially of course) but I'm obviously missing something here http://i.imgur.com/WEVthfm.png
that's good
probably just bugfixes
How did the mod uploader change? any idea?
excellent

i hope that works
mb
.GetAimDirection
so ill just yeah
use if player:GetShootingDirection ~= nil then
it does not
right? xD
doesnt mean hes shooting
CanShoot
cause
hmm
well if its nil then you know hes not shooting
but ill give it another look
theres getshootingdirection
look inside entityPlayer. i think thereis soemthing for that
maybe check for the animation of th eplayer shooting?
how to know if the player is shooting?
guys
(the documentation isn't working for me right now)
Does that save it per save file?
Isaac:SaveModData (table ref, string data) ?
which would break everything
I can't reset it at the start, as someone can still continue previously started run
unless I can get the value of the save it is currently running at, it won't work
and set it with PLAYER_POST_INIT and if the Timer is zero or almost zero
nah. i dont think its possiible to save vars on the player. But you could just save it in an globalvar?
Is there any way to make an offset relative to the direction isaac's facing? I've been trying to do ParentOffset based on the X/Y values of the velocity vector but that doesn't actually work
Since you can have 3 game started and not finished at once
just found that
nvm
I mean, I want to have variables with the same name and different value for every run
whatever
ive been like 15 min looking that on the docs
Yeah
how the fuck do you get the position of an entity xD
but
maybe this is a stupid question
like player.[customVar]
you mean really on player?
Is there any way to save variables on player?
hey!
i guess
so i need to check for all the familiars pos

the familiar despawns after you leave the room
of dmg
and the player tooks 1 heart
summons a familiar
my active item
the thing is
depends how you want to do it, really
fire a tear in the loop, and edit those tears
I mean, you can check for that
what if i spawn 2 familiars
i mean
what if i have multiple familiars of the same one
the problem is
now i just have to get the position of the familiar
probably same thing
so i can edit those tears
Im trying to use .FireTear
I dunno
just create a tear entity?
xd
cant edit those tears
so
.shoot returns nothing
check the docs
The update that came for a few hours ago
my god
These things always confuse me
But you can edit tear entities now
ye
right xD?
because i cant familiar:FireTear
not really. position is a param in player:FireTear so
It wouldnt be that hard, would it?
actually
oh
there isnt another way to do it i guess
but
that seems hard xd
<@132627275307810817> you could get hacky and fire a tear from EntityPlayer and give it the position of the familiar as parameter
yep
And to access a vector's X coordinate, it's something like vector.X isn't it?
but it worked pretty good because the familiar shoots in the same direction as me
cause .shoot is shit
then maybe i have to change the function
yes
what the hell
Positive X is in the right direction in terms of vectors right?
yeah
what the actual fuck
Shoot returns nothing lol
hmm
Also the mod would be *really interesting*.
depends on what Shoot returns. if its an EntityTear, EntityTear now exists
Its actually supposed to be op, but eh. I hope someone makes it. I suck at games like Binding of Isaac.
Do you guys know how to change the tearparameters that familiar.Shoot() shoot xd?
Hmm
interestingly enough, using spritescale makes brimstone last forever
Good idea, huh? Hehehe. ; )
Feel free.
_it is time to test_
that seems pretty easy...i wonder how you scale a laser entity / if you can
ah that makes more sense
There. Fixed it.
i suppose
and use that entity as a tear
And then create an entity
I think you have to make an anm2 file
No fucking idea
Yeah they do
how can i make it, ghenza?
Yes <@132627275307810817> . Totally not op at all. Hee hee.
i thought tears already increased in size based on damage am i crazy
Oh how that would break the game and be fun.
not op at all
You know what would be a fun mod? You probably know this, but your tears grow in size the more damage you have, but brimstone doesnt. Make it so brimstone shoots a bigger beam the more damage you have. <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
I knew it
hahaha
xDDD
how do i make it?
i want a pink penis tear
yes, is this
lol
yeah xD
if you for example want to create a pink penis tear
for example
Like fire mind
how do you mean <@132569939969179648>
Someone know how to make custom tear sprites?
It's not horribly impeding, but it's pretty annoying either way
Like, when the game starts up that is
So ever since I started modding, Steam Client Services asks me each time if it can make changes, that normal?
then you'll get a new error which tells you what to do as well
you need to follow its instructions and go to tools -> settings and point it to your resources folder
it also crashes when i click new
i get this error whenever i open the room editor
lol
you almost killed yourself
yeah, you were trying to help endershot
ok ^^
but whatever
i dont know whether you remember that
you helped me a lot jean xD
Hey
hi ?
Im so fucking happy
Yeah i just connected
Right on time for me too
^
Can i finish my shooting familiar? ?
So
EntityTear was added
When it comes to modding that is* ^^;
So did the update today change/fix/add anything ?
thanks ?
Should be `~/Library/Application Support/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods?`
Does anyone know where I can find the game/mods folders on a mac? My home machine is windows but I just found out my mods broke in the latest patch so I was wondering if I could have a look into it on here for now. (Can't get home for 5 hours)
The item I guess
spider mod?
how does the spidermod text work? 9001.1 and 9001.2
the mimic has an ID but no enum
indeed...like
When I was modding the other day I noticed some enums were not listed but you could spawn them by their number, specifially entities in the 300's. I can't check if they are there now though but it would be cool if they are.
:P
Well, huge chunks of enums they don't remember
what do you mean?
Anybody who's been sitting deep in enums noticed anything unusual?
someone has to tell <@!267112861921181697> They can finially do there tear thing
haven't seen anything change with the lua classes surrounding config unfortunately. i haven't checked to see if my itempools.xml works
I mean it actually working
¯\_(?)_/¯
there's been 5 forever
anything new on Addign items to pools?
I feel like there were 4 before ¯\_(?)_/¯
doesn't look like it
I also feel like there's a new Config entry
yes
Was EntityPickup there before?
huh
can finally make soem tear mods
Yeah, there's a new class
Ohh
im happy
<:isaac_shoop:231218479607316480>
and apparently you get an EntityTear from FireTear
<:isaac_shocked:245063314692898817>
lol, i received only 14 minutes ago
AHHHHHH
WAS IT?!?!
nope, I'll do that now
EntityTear was introduced
Anybody checked docs for changes?
I dotn knw what it does though
no changelog afaik
there was a 13 Mb update
it did!
Also, the update never came yesterday, did it?
Yarr?
erm
thats a good qestion
how were you modding without it ?
I just got AB+
Yay
that's neat
cool
yep
can you do math operations with vectors like "vectorX = vectorY * 12" ?
yeah got it
can you snap windows by dragging the dark grey heading boxes?
it should automatically arrange things
at least they're showing ?

and relaunch
in the folder for the animation editor try delete Layout.dat
does nothing when I press
animation list

and make sure you have all of em on the screen
try go under Window
weird
i just launched it
looks like your missing some windows...

where?
click on layer
done
open some animations
why is the animation editor blank
np ^^
didn't know that thank you
ah ok
-1 is generally returned if the input was invalid, or if nothing else fits.
hm.
but the Direction can be NO_DIRECTIOn LEFT RIGHT TOP or DOWN, so wouldn't NO_DIRECTION be the state of not firing?
probably if he doesnt fire at all
hey i was looking throgh the code of some mods from the workshop and found this line"if player.GetFireDrection ~= -1" and i don't get the point of that, because in what situation would the Direction be -1 ? Help?
well. thank you tho
nooooooooo
great api
you can't add new stages
but when i try to change the stage via stage command, it doenst show up
yeah
have you tried stages.xml ?
has anyone managed to do custom stages?
np
Thanks <@223869207748542464>
<@81035468866584576> not needed
damn documentation ?
is that "timeout" as in non-interactable or as in how long it's been active
anyone know what EntityPickup:Timeout does?
don't think so
So, if i add a pure passive item who give hearts, there is no need to declare it in the main.lua or is it still needed ?
always best to check examples first
Thank you !
Yes i did understand that ?
Sorry that i couldn't figure it myself -_-
you can drop hearts in code
So stats are only to be 'coded' and things like hearts are in the items.xml ? I see...
if you are specifically looking for soulhearts, take a look at the Rosary:
<passive description="Faith up" gfx="Collectibles_072_Rosary.png" id="72" name="Rosary" soulhearts="6" />
2 equates to one full heart
every 1 heart is half a heart
Oh !
<passive description="HP up" gfx="Collectibles_022_Lunch.png" hearts="2" id="22" maxhearts="2" name="Lunch" />
we can look at Lunch as an example
in items.xml
in the xml
I did understand how to modify stats with an item but i can't figure how to give soul hearts (HEART_SOUL (?)) to the character, someone can help ?
nvm
they're in items.xml
no
are trinkets pickups?
they are pickups
but still, would be nice to just do one item ?
oh consumable I think
are hearts collectibles?
although that will make it so they can't pick up ANY collectible in the room until they finish combat
that would prevent  picking up hearts though
cheers, i'll have a look
or do that apparently
player:CanAddCollectible = false
you can
or something
that resembles an item
probably gonna need a custom entity
can you explain me the idea
I have an item that is dropped on combat, but I want to prevent the player from picking it up again until they are finished fighting
hm...
anyone know if you can make an item non-pickupable ?
I already declared it -_-
I'm dumb
OH RIGHT
<@81035468866584576> we declare is collectible passive or active in items.xml
collectible should be both active/passive
I don't know if i'm using the right words, i'm speaking about a item that you can take and will not be activable nor shown if the top left of the screen
How can you declare a passive item then ? Was using ``if player:HasCollectible(item_name_local)``
i'm disappointed by this entity tear business ?
can be every item yes
Hum
I think they can also be active items
Hey, ``Collectible`` are passive items, right ?
there's also still no real way to change the player's tear variant
does FireTear still crash on linux ?
FireTear returns an EntityTear atleast
is that for real
I can't use EntityTear because there's no ToTear() function on Entity ?
in any way, i need a function that teleports me to a custom room. only changeRoom() exists, but with that i can only change rooms within a level.
Something like that yeah !
blow up an arcade machine and its a hole underneath
Or portals :p
Maybe a items who can teleport you to it ?
that would be sweet ? i planned to make it as a challenge, but without a "goto" equivalent in lua that wont be possible i guess
suddenly PACMAN
should be a secret room type ? like a bonus level in mario
grats
oh yeah i saw that btw it's really cool !
ty ^^
GG !
anyways. Is it possible to make a new stage with only a single room?
Uhhhh! My pacman mod blew up on twitter overnight ? even tyrone mentioned it. almost 300 RT's     and 900 Fav's
Snappy the Tortoise has 3 items
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837662670
Thanks !
i don't, ill check my history
i'm gonna check it out as well
Do you remember the name <@229593818691928067> ?
probably each in their own folder maybe
Oh, i should check that
like not in the description
on the workshop
i saw a mod that listed the different items it contained
not even sure you can use external lua files
Around ~15
I can see it getting to be a long file though if you do a lot
Started learning lua 2 days ago, so i still have noobish questions, sorry ^^
you dont need a new mod for every item ^^
code them all in main.lua under the one mod name (mod pack))
I'm making a mod who is a set of items and graphic modifications
i dont know why it shouldnt work but still
why would you want to load multiple mods in only one lua?
oh yeah thx i'll try the index
i have ```entityData = {}
function npcUpdate(_, npc)
  if entityData[npc] == null then
    entityData[npc] = {}
  end
end
```
Or, will it be much cleaner to have a ``main.lua`` loading multiple ``modname.lua`` ?
<@229593818691928067> Entity.Index is what you are searching for
Also, i can register multiple mod/function by using multiple 

``local ModName = RegisterMod( "ModName", 1);`` ?
what if there's several of the same entity type
well
<@229593818691928067>  what do you mean exactly? You can specify the entity in NPC_UPDATE
Thnx
<@81035468866584576> yea
Items in items.xml can have space inside their name, right ?
?
how can i identify an EntityNpc ? between updates the EntityNpc is not the same object
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5n425j/aftebirth_20170109_update_b185_unofficial_patch/
ok :p
some techy person might have look for changes with git or sth similar. i dont know tho
looking through the docs lol, i kind of expectet EntityTear to be added so i just looked ^^
how did you know what changed ?
amazing
ooooooooooooooh
oh i didn't see that
damn, but as far as i can see EntityTear is the most important change ^^
on steam
i didn't see any
hey ?
are there any patchnotes to the isaac update?
good morning everyone!
hi
hello ?
?
hoverboard?
works though
?
if (not hoverboardEnabled and inCombat and (cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED)) then
  
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 0.5
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 0.5
  
    end
lol
should be able to fix that though
thanks for the help EatMeReturns - it's working now - except the stats are a bit  wonky like you mentioned
probably a GridEntity
Is the shopkeeper an EntityNPC?
you have int, int, vector, vector, entity <@195368190333812736>
your arguments need to be int, int, int, vector, vector, entity
you didn't describe a subtype
oh
are you getting an error in log.txt?
should work
Doesnt work
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant. PICKUP_LOCKEDCHEST,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
cool
well that's not true, you probably can't EvaluateItems() before the floor finishes spawning or whatever
Anyone know the code to spawn Gold chests?
you can EvaluateItems() anywhere
for an evaluteitems
does the callback have to be PEFFECT_UPDATE or just UPDATE?
yeah, I have bools for determining if it should up or down stats
you would need to make it so your MC_EVALUATE_CACHE properly accounts for whether it should be 1 or 2
so say your item gives 1 damage on pickup but at a later point in time it gives 2 damage instead of 1
ok
ah, so this is the manual call
at least, that is my understanding.
the xml flags are for when it gets picked up
right
so you have to add the cacheflags even if they're already flagged in the xml?
so it takes the player's base stats then re-adjusts for each collectible and item and such
it finds the new stats completely from scratch
just remember that each time the cache is evaluated
thanks, I'll give it a shot
that's how I do it for the same functionality you describe.
ok sweet
that will do it for you
right
not just when picking up or dropping an item
trying to adjust stats on the fly
ok
for each flag you want to make sure it evaluates
do entityPlayer:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY)
but before you call that method
cheers, I'll try it
entityPlayer:EvaluateItems()
anyone know if you can manually evaluate cache?
ridiculous.
well it looks like we got the EntityTear class but not the :ToTear() cast function on Entities? so we probably can't access it unless the function gives you an EntityTear
don't seem to have the ChangeVariant method as described in the documentation for EntityTear
is that entities with type ENTITY_TEAR
well my issue
i can peek around it though
lol
i don't
<@135254843567767552> do you know if anybody has used EntityTear yet?
Im dumb
assuming it's positive.
Yeah
Oh
makes the number a negative.
-1 * (player.Position.Y-5)
you just .Y + 5?
That would make the 5 a comment
.Y--5
-1 * ()
Like how to make the number a negitive
Okay, so when I do this: Vector(door.Position.X-0, player.Position.Y-5) the item Im spawning goes up (because of the Position.Y-5) how do I make it go down?
what is the thing that you want to be down
<@195368190333812736> you're going to have to elaborate on your question
<@116386733905412105> Do you know the answer to my question?
```local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
            entities[i]:ChangeVariant(33)```

This shit gives me "attempt to call a nil value (method 'ChangeVariant')"
@here anyone know how to do positive on a Y acsess
Vector(door.Position.X-0, player.Position.Y-5)
Instead of up I want it ot be down how?
how tf do I use EntityTear
So you have to do GridEntity.Desc.Type
did tyrone tweet a changelog or anything
EntityTear is a thing now
ok so
Speaking of GetType(), it seems to return userdata that can't be compared to the GridEntityType table we have access to?
i've never seen any data in GetData myself so i'm not sure what it's for
haha
Yay for consistency!
Oh. Well now I just feel stupid. I was so locked into 'GetType' after seeing it for GridEntity.
Entity.Type?
If not, anyone know how to get an entity's EntityType?
Does Entity:GetData() currently contain anything? Can't seem to DebugString anything from it.
I can't still figure out how custom fonts works ?
How do you use the game seed in random number generation?
Robo-Baby didn't like it either, huh?
well i guess that's about what i should have expected
That's it.
They added `EntityTear`.
has anyone cooked up the changes to the modding api from the last update?
Okay
Yes.
?
end
player:AnimateSad()
elseif number >198 and number <202 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED ,0,0,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
But how do I do it
Okay
`player:AnimateSad()`
?
end
EntityPlayer:AnimateSad()
elseif number >198 and number <202 then
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_GREED ,0,0,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
Now how do I run Entity players
`EntityPlayer:AnimateSad()`?
Anyone know the name of the effect that when Isaac puts his head in hands
I wasn't aware tears had a shadow
Can it be done?
oh no shadow
I've already recolored the tears to be transparent.
Maybe a tear effect <@266141401824100362>
Anybody know how to make tears have no shadow?
Anyone know how to make entitys spawn at a door isaac can get to?
my firedelay stuff works
uh
Nope working
Did anyone crack how to do the CACHE_FIREDELAY stuff?
Nope still need help
Wait
@here Does anyone know when you spawn something it has a random chance to spawn 2?
may have realized my issue since other mods are loading ok. This mod is reskin only, no main.lua. So luamod may be expecting a main.lua to execute
no idea
can someone tell me how translation mod works? especially with custom fonts
...oh lol
```lua
if pickup:IsShopItem() then
```
why wouldn't v just be the value of that entity in the table
now I'm getting an error on "if pickup.IsShopItem() then":

bad argument #1 to 'IsShopItem' (EntityPickup expected, got table)
https://twitter.com/htnevard/status/818698494873628674
anyone can help making translation mod? it dosent detect custom fonts
... in the ~~array~~ loop, and then use it instead of `v`.
It is an `Entity`, not `EntityPickup`. Put ```lua
local pickup = v:ToPickup()
```
do I just remove the  == true part?
In line 9 of this function, I'm getting an error:
```
attempt to call a nil value (field 'IsShopItem')
```
https://hastebin.com/zudequfenu.lua
the mod not existing
anyone know what causes 'failed to run mod' when calling luamod in the console?
ummm what?
? ?
<@70946604139425792>
So uh anybody willing to help out with a mini expansion mod?
There's no pointers in lua?
Eh I guess I'll just work on it some other time
Hmm, now how would I make that displacement relative to something like a velocity vector, because right now something like this is a bit off http://i.imgur.com/L27oE8l.png
It sucks how there's no callback for picking up a certain consumable.
You can.
or does that only work with a key
like tablename[i]
can I get a numerical position in a table
Oh okay, that actually works
I didnt even realise I was playing bingo! :D
Bingo!
<@266032468853915650> is ti you? :D Did I win?!
Not sure how it works, but maybe something like this?

```lua
local laser = player:FireBrimstone(target)
laser.ParentOffset = laser.ParentOffset + Vector(0, 20)
```
Guess who can't sleep!
But that only takes a vector, which I'm not entirely sure how to use really
Well, I'm just using the player:FireBrimstone thing
<@130188705498529792> Could you show how you shoot Brimstone?
Or rather his mouth
As it is now, it just looks a bit off for the laser to start from Isaac's eyes
I guess I'll use spawn instead.
oohh, I though he was trying to use Spawn
<@150336707609231362> Their problem is that `EntityPlayer:AddBlueFlies` seems to expect global coordinates on the floor (I can't explain this behavior otherwise), but `EntityPlayer.Position` is local position in the room, not on the floor.
No, it works fine with a vector.
something else isent working
wwell thats how you get his position
Which doesn't work
That's the same as player.Position
Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Position will give you his position
Is there any way to sort of displace the Brim from FireBrimstone, so that it's not always firing from Isaac's eyes?
So if I wanted blue flies to spawn where Isaac was, how would I do it?
anythinjg under attribute uses a .
It still doesn't work.
It's not a method, so `.Position`, not `:Position`.
Actually, I just need to know what Isaac's position is since player:Position doesn't work.
None of the parameters are position. There's only number, speed in which they fly in, and entity they fly to.
Is there any way when spawning blue flies to not make them fly in from the top left of the screen?
Though since I'm firing off the Brimstone with player:FireBrimstone, I'm still not sure if I can change that brim's color
nice
Also I figured out the effect thing, it's apparently part of Isaac commands
Oh, thanks.
^
```lua
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.damageCounter, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
```
If I want to trigger a function when Isaac gets hit, is it this?
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG(player),mod.damageCounter)
hmm. maybe the ; is interfearing some how
function Facade:InvisibleTears() --Statistical changes on pickup of Facade
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  if player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_TECHNOLOGY) then
    Isaac.DebugString("asdf")
  end
end
gonna do some testing
pickup.Price = 0 drops everything on the floor. Which works I guess, but I'd like to try and discover how to make the price 0
depend on how you are trying to use it
When I do that, it throws "attempt to index a nil value (local 'player')" when I try to use that variable.
I always forget the zero
yeah, zero as well
not Isaac.GetPlayer(0)?
player=Isaac.GetPlayer()
<@130188705498529792> don't know
I can't seem to initialize a local player
Is that a matter of just calling the effect?
Yeah, sorry, a typo. It's `Price`.
sup Markus?
Also, how do you get a sound/particle effect to happen like a fart cloud/noise?
Okay I'm running into something really weird.
I though charge would be the charge on the active item
that is strange
Oh. My bad, apparently `PickupPrice` is for devil deals only; for shop you just do `pickup.Price = 0`
as a wrok around
just ahve it return isaacs coins
and only set the ones that are to free
could test each entity for shop item
so I wont change it
I know
that only returns
But then will that change the color of all the Brimstone that's fired, because I want a brimstone from a specific item to be a different color
What if IsShopItem() affects it
get the brimstone entity then use set color I think
Is there a way to change the color of brimstone, or that still a ways off?
There's also `EntityPickup.Charge`, maybe it affects that too?
yep same, with only that code running
very strange
And when it says 0, it actually takes money anyway.
After updating it gets its old price back.
did you Update the entity?
Yep. That's only visual. Why would that be available then?
untill you run Update()
give yourself a few coins and pick one up. That might only be visual
do you have zero coins? you may ahve to have 1
Or might not.
But that might be because I'm playing around with other code.
oh...
no wait 3
yeah I'll play with it.
Also, I can't pick them up for some reason.
2mil
Of course you'll have to be more specific with what you set price on.
all items are pickups
or is it just that all items, including pedestals, are
Interesting. Are all items in the shop classified as pickups?
both will work, that one looks better though <:isaac_tongue:245063314906808320>

thanks
?
<@134478547795443712> ```lua
  for k,v in ipairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
    if v.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP then
      local pickup = v:ToPickup()
      pickup.Price = PickupPrice.PRICE_FREE
    end
  end
```
?
Not this early though
usually during the night it dies down
kids going back to school?
Also is this room...more dead than usual? Usually around this time it's super full
Robo-baby disagrees
yeah
yup, that works
detect the entities, spawn them again, delete the item stuff
and then check when one disappears from being bought
thoguh so
maybe detect all the entities
I want to do something more specific relating to buying stuff in the shop, not the literal effect I suppose
*function
there is a use card command
/store credit
Anyone have an idea of how to do the credit card effect
alright
i'm off to sleep bois
that probably sets what its orbiting around
or use GetOrbitPosition(Vector)
I imagen you just need to set them is all
I'd try changing them
Oh.
EntityFamiliar even has some attributes for orbitals
robo baby is unimpressed
Really?
ok
oh
look at the Angry Fly mod, that has orbiting
cos
that requires math
how 2 orbital tho xd
?
eyy
IT HERE BOIS
<@266032468853915650> name it IdleDown
actually yeah. all familiers have an amimation called idle I think
that as well
Either that or give your entity an animation named idle
get the entity and do ent:GetSprite():Play("mirror",1)
and the rendertext shows up
it doesnt show up but it has a shadow

What happens if you try to spawn it?
i think I got the anm2 right
it may be invisable for some reason(I dont directly know the reason)
no fam still
also, we cant put subTypes
Looking good
looks good now
https://hastebin.com/lesedamevo.xml
Dunno
that would make ym life ez
can we have a subtype as well?
but then again, you added a variant
And the variant has to be unique in that casdz
oh cool. I though we could do anything with the ID's
Yeah, id 3 is familiar
dosent need to be 3(wait is ID 3 the familier)
Gotta get up in 3 hours
I hate myself
I know...
Is this the familiar? If yes you need to put 3 as ID
>Scayze you were supposed to be sleeping
dosent need a variant unless you want to have 2 with the same ID
oh damn
yup
you have to?
did you give it an id?
```<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
    <entity anm2path="mirror_of_sorrow.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="11" collisionDamage="3" collisionMass="2" collisionRadius="13" friction="1" name="Mirror Of Sorrow" numGridCollisionPoints="12" shadowSize="15" stageHP="0" variant="100">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />
    </entity>
</entities>
``` entities2.xml
oh wait. never mind
you said entity variant. dont you want the entity type?
anyone knows how to familiar ? https://hastebin.com/ubobibavev.lua
Real time log display. Uses Python. Run it after Isaac
Oh okay, I was looking in Rebirth's file
You have to manually reload it in most editors tho
In the afterbirth + folder in myGames
Where do you find "log.txt" anyway, I found one file like it but it doesn't update with debug messages
Anyone found out how to detect Isaacs tears?
cya all!
gotta go
k
Have to eat
like Bones:onUpdate()
Bbl
not the name of the item, but the name of your mod goes infront of your function name
you also mixed something up
ahhhh
why do you need a table anyway? just use SACK_OF_BONES instead of SacksofBones.SACKS_OF_BONES
you havent defined SacksofBones anywhere
local Bones = RegisterMod("Bones", 1)

SacksofBones.SACKS_OF_BONES = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Sacks of Bones")

function SacksofBones:onUpdate()
    if Room:IsFirstVisit() == true then
        
    end
end    

SacksofBones:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,SacksofBones.onUpdate)
wanna show me your code?
that?
local Bones = RegisterMod("Bones", 1)
the what
have you declared the table before the GetItemByName function?
he apperently doenst know what sacksofbones is
SacksofBones.SACKS_OF_BONES = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Sacks of Bones")
np!
[INFO] - ERR: ... Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/bones!/main.lua:3: attempt to index a nil value (global 'SacksofBones')

anyone know why it's saying this? It's in the register mod line
thanks ?
that's a cool item
Oh nice, it's the Attractive Buddy!
haha nice xd
(smirky selfpromotion)
well i suggest looking at an mod that adds one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836249223
what the heck
ok
umm ok so I have 0 idea how to make a familiar xd
534 subscribers sweet! ?
getting feedback feels good man
hmmk
<@266032468853915650> it doesnt have a function but same attributes. dunno try it out
What would be a good monster to "gummify" for my item?
it even has a function to orbit the player i think
okay im gonna try to figure out how to fix this custom challenge
as familiar?
ehh
anyone know how to make an orbital?
aye
ayeverybody
np ?
Oh hey, ".Velocity" worked, thanks a bunch
nomore
donthurtme
isweartogodillneverdoitagaindonthurtme ._.
D:
you're grounded
xD yep i did. sorrey ~ :p
Oh yeah, values
<@130188705498529792> not really. Rule of thumb is use ":" for functions like GetType()  and "." for values like Position or Velocity
that's the last straw
that's it
"Scayze - Today at 9:17 PM
restart steam"
did you just fucking tell me what to do
Oh wait, it's "." because player is a child of Entity, and that's entity's function right?
restart steam
instead from steam
i'm gonna launch it from the folder
tried the first
^^
<@166249905772429312> try verifying the game cache or reinstalling isaac if nothing works
I was looking at playerentity but realized that all entities have velocity of some kind
Oh wait it's under entity, right
not ":" but .
so it's not that
i removed all mods from my folder
Player.Velocity
<@166249905772429312> have you modified an xml file? it happened to me once when my xml file was incorrect
Is it straight "Player:Velocity" or is it that "GetVelocityBeforeUpdate" thing?
where x and y stand for the values the player moves each frame
Vector(x,y)
like
and speed
the direction
no
the speed at which the player moves
my uh
my isaac won't start
whenever i try to launch it
it crashes like every millisecond
the "game is launching" message appears on steam
disappears
and appears again
my friends told me it kept on saying i was playing the game every second
Wait, what does Velocity spit out?
<@130188705498529792> check for player.Velocity ?
thanks, i spent the last 15 minutes on it qq
i dont think you can edit rooms anymore
<@155169558121021440> cool icon! ?
Hmm, guess there's no reliable way I can think of to see if the player's moving diagonally
hm.
i tried to replace the penny pickup sound and put the modified soundfile in the correct folder structure, but it doesnt replace it
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839096488
is it not possible to mod sound effect yets?
A little stuck on this one, dunno how exactly to do it
How would I change the skin color of Isaac?
wait does it work for AB+?
its fine if i put Basement Renovator in the tools folder right
how long is it going to be on sale for?
I guess I should probably buy ab+
probably would have preferred he asked me before uploading but whatever, im okay with it
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836527432 check it out im internet famous
But yeah, how would you know if a player is moving diagonally?
(except for regular enemies I could make it like 40% taken off)
Right now for bosses it instead takes off 25% of the boss's health and generates some random enemies. I could just make it do that for all enemies
lmao
for example the dark gray champion would drop a key and turn into a normal monster
basically if there are champions on the screen, use the grater to make them normal enemies and drop any consumables (if applicable) connected to the champion
I have sort of an idea to make it unique but not sure if its possible to make or not
That's fine. I have an alternative method for it anyways
How would you  keep track of diagonal movement, is it if their directions are both some X and Y directions simulatneously?
fuck
I haven't seen much antibirth
yes
...thats a thing?
is that just the cleaver from antibirth?
https://gfycat.com/LimitedEverlastingHuemul
:D
after 2 days of smashing my head against a brick wall
But hey at least my familiar is almost done
:c
Man I missed the drama party
its wip
currently you cant get achievements with mods
because i really need to have the need to have the no overlay mod
ingame or steam too
and i still get achievements
with the simple mod loader
and music
i'm using mods
except future versions will allow achievements for graphical mods
in ab+ edmund locked achievements with mods installed
mods don't affect achievements by default iirc
hey, theres a way to make mods not affect achievements right?
I think that posts they repiin are gpomg in the boosters
I'm a *little* excited for it. Depends on their standards, I guess.
yes
Am I the only one who is genuinely excited for the booster packs?
Wait, how does GetMovementVector work exactly?
Probably, yeah.
So I need it in resources?
Screw you, Robo-Baby.
Oh
players.xml in the content folder *adds* to the player roster.
Might I recommend viewing some Youtube videos on how to do it? Lyte has some pretty useful stuff so far.
I just gave Isaac a custom item in players.xml and this happened.
Um help
It was pretty complex. I didn't even know Spawn could spawn items.
<#205854782542315520> is slowly becoming <#207259602969034753>
Telling you the specific command to spawn your specific item, which can be found easily on the subreddit, isn't helping. Telling how to do it yourself is.
Well, the more people that get helped now, the more they can spread their knowledge, and less people will need help in the future.
I forgot the items folder.
Yeah, I figured it out.
Anyways <@!182509747835109387>, make sure your item is in the right directory. Should be like, `gfx/items/collectibles`.
<@!182509747835109387> It clogs up the modding channel when people repeatedly ask for help for things they can easily figure out themselves
np ^^
okay, thanks!
<@223869207748542464> you can check for a new run by using MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, but that also triggers when continuing the run, so you might wanna have another check, like if its in the first stage or sth
<@112975821186031616> Geez, if people want to help, they can. This isn't a competition.
That's why I got that error lol
I accidentally gave two pills the same ID
like i am talking not about spawning items, i am talking about modding in general.
^
This is a modding channel. Maybe they should be going to the <#220581404612886528> channel if they want to learn basic programming concepts. I'm tired of people using the documentation as an excuse to get everyone else, who is on an even playing field, to do the work for them.
<@223869207748542464> You don't even need to know lua to know how to spawn in items though
The documentation is very poor
<@70946604139425792> you know, people have different knowledge of lua, or programming languages.
The API documentation sucks, but other people have been plenty capable of using it and making stuff happen with what limited is there. You can even search the Subreddit and often get answers to simple questions like these.
I made the rest of the mod myself.
I wasn't being dependent. I just needed help with one thing.
<@!182509747835109387> doing it by yourself helps you the most. youll learn to solve problems instead of beeing dependent on others. Also, you were asking for help all day long, give the people that help you some time for their own projects ^^
How to check if the player has started new run?
Like, even in the *tiny amount of documentation* the API has, spawning in items is covered
<@223869207748542464> Questions can be asked and answered within reason but it's bad form to ask people to give you fish when you can hold the fishing rod yourself
My items are still invisible though. I'll try saving as 32-bit again.
Man, its easy to spawn the item
this chat is about modding, if anyone has a question why it can't be answered
Or multiple new items.
I want you to be able to do stuff by yourself without taking up other generous people's time in doing the modding for you.
Yeah, but I'm making a large mod, so it's helpful to have an item you start with that just spawns a new item.
In fact, that's literally shoved in your face the first time you open console
If you're just trying to spawn your item ingame, open console and type giveitem YourItemName
like stop guys!
Dude, the documentation is very... underdocumented
He's not lying
What do you have against me?
Why do you want me to get so little help anyway?
No, it's not easy because Spawn only accepts an entity.
<@!182509747835109387> *Please*  learn how to read the documentation. This is something you could very easily do by yourself if you just read the Spawn function.
i didn't tried to make pills
just a theory
idk
Better yet, instead of making the item spawn I would just spawn it in via console
How would I check the pill?
yes!
It owuld be 
```Lua
item_id = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("MyItem")
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, item_id, pos, Vector(0, 0), nil)
```
<@160171640339038208>  check what pill is isaac curently holding and then remove it, apply effect
So where do I put the ID?
But tell me if you find out how, <@!194259969359478784> ?
nop. i wish
Isaac.GetItemIdByName("MyItem") is you item id
has anyone figured out how to make an entity stay in the same place on the screen even in big rooms?
Sax stahp.
Hey guys, does anyone know how to make multiple pills in the same lua file? I've tried doing that but it makes one pill that does all the pill effects
but
spawn it like a normal
Isaac.Spawn(0,0,0,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
So I know how the sprite looks in-game
I'm trying to spawn a custom passive item
custom item
i didn't noticed it
what are you trying to spawn?
oh lol
Err, The first argument of Spawn is an entitytype, not a collectibletype
```
local MyItem = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("MyItem")
Isaac.Spawn(MyItem,0,0,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
```
do
oh
It crashed the game.
Isaac.Spawn(Isaac.GetItemIdByName("MyItem")
,0,0,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
Okay, thanks.
Isaac.Spawn(
Isaac.GetItemIdByName("MyItem")
,0,0,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
like this
so
enter name of item and then passit
get by name
do item
IDK
what exactly is line 6 of your main.lua file?
Isaac.GetItemBy
<@135254843567767552> ive tried the goto command, first with my rooms set as 4021 - 4024 (Which didnt work bcause I think the vlues were too high), and then I tried it with rooms 1-4 (Which worked, but brought me to rooms that were already ingame.
u need to
Oh yes

How to detect if a player started new run!?
the wiki doesn't have the unlock method for some reason
GUYS , GUYS !
no shit
Golly, it's a shame there's no wiki-like source of information for all of the Binding of Isaac out there.
just google
I honesltly forgot how
I unlocked it in afterbirth but the save file switch took my rebirth file
Actually be good at Isaac.
how do I unlock blue bomber
No
:/
yeah, that's what i thought
I imagine official items aren't coded in lua.
Not that I'm aware.
by the way, is it possible to see the coding behind already existing items? or are those handled differently?
ok
Might still be do-able. When  the item is used, remove the spawned boss, then script your effect.
not sure how that'll work :/
instead of summoning a boss
as in making Delirious unleash a random effect from any of the Active items upon usage
sorry i was thinking of something way beyond just changing stats
<@112975821186031616> ah okay
*That's* a function? How oddly specific.
Oh, I forgot to add a callback.
yes
local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
is pos is a player pos or something?
Will it be able to spawn a custom item?
If I have this:
```lua
  Isaac.Spawn(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_512,0,0,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
```
<#267353315073982465>
but that looks gud
Probably you need to ask that in spriting channel
o
is it good th
That GREED

what?
is this good?
Guys
Okay got it, thank you.
goto d.1032 for example, <https://files.catbox.moe/ih1owt.png> the id is on the right there i guess
oh yes
the goto command is apparently what you use to change rooms.
idk
and then rename it to start room, or what it's called
like i don't used rooms editor, but like make a copy of ur room
How would I go about doing that- sorry, im a bit new at this
replace start room with room that you need to preview
So is there ay other way to test your rooms made with Room Editor then, if instapreview doesnt work?
true
Or you could make breakfast give +5 damage.
yeah i mean even if i can get no breakfast at all i'll be ok
If the item only changes stats, you could always just make it take away those stats and do something different, <@155169558121021440>.
but break fast wont spawn at all
i'll do that when i actually figure out how to code
aha thank you
yes, i was about to say that
but stop
check if item pedestal is breakfast, if so replace with pentagram
oh alright
right now it's impossible
I mean technically it's probably kinda-sorta possible if the item isn't too special.
no, no way
there's probably not a way to alter it so pentagram appears instead of breakfast, right
not now
<@155169558121021440>  no
I couldn't get the Instapreview to work either, for what it's worth. Might just be broken, or you have to sacrifice some unborn babies and change some hidden settings.
guess it just doesn't work then, same issue here. complain to tyrone i guess?
Is it possible for one to go about changing the effects of existing items?
The roome editore itself is running fine, its the instapreview isn't launching for me. It says "Cannot find isaac execultable/path or both. Please adjust the settings and try again."
Ive put the path to my Isaac-Ng.exe and the folder its in, but I still get that error.
what's the error?
Yes
and imported your binaries?
Yes
have you gone into the settings and pointed it to your resources folder yet?
When I try to run the instapreview, or the room editor itself.
<@158824226189606912> is it giving you an error when you launch?
Well then.
will help you
<@158824226189606912> i think no one
sorry forgot
The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx\ui\achievement
whats the file called <@223869207748542464>
Can I get some help with the room editor tool added in afterbirth+ please
The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\gfx\ui
yeah
like that one
no

no

cards that appear when you unlock something
Secret Cards?
someone fuckinjg tell me
where the fuck are the Secrets cards
Is anyone else having trouble with the Room Editor tool added with afterbirth+? I cant get its Instapreview function to work, so I cant test any of the rooms.
you can just add 1 life if u don't want familiar, but u wont have item...
o
Yes, I do.
you don't want familiar
it adds familiar too
but
maybe just you need to addConsumables true
The familiar is part of the item.
familiar
but
`` player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_ONE_UP, 0, true)`` WORKS!
yes
<@223869207748542464> Did you try giving 1-up to Isaac using Lua yet?
like the card that appears when you unlock something
where are the secret card sprites? I need to edit them to suit the items I am adding
Not sure if this would go in modding, but I cant seem to get the instapreview function of the roomeditor to work. Ive set the paths and everything, but it still says it cant find them.
?
I can't seem to get it to work.
Why is adding an item with another item literally cancer?
okay
you can send pm with it to me<:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
Well advenced rules
I dont know the rules either
Its pure cancer
I made a title screen but its got to do with ISIS so I wont post it
yes
lol

better than ab+
the best dlc
yes
Someone want help me creating a brand new dlc
oh
Because it is for me.
I need you to check if AddCollectible is broken for 1-up.
what i was about to do
<@!182509747835109387>  so what do you need
like those cards that appear when you unlock something
Wheres the Secrets sprites
oh, sorry, i just was amazed by sprite Icerzz drew for me
Or can he not reply in modding.
<@216324079504982016> You there?
Yes
everything*
is robobaby just made to add reactions to nothing
<@223869207748542464> Is it not working for you either?
Alright
robobaby pls
But you can't add your own achievments.
According to the API, you can add items when achievements are unlocked.
the only thing related to Achievement is AchievementID
robobay is on my side
Oh my goodness, just search achievement in the documentation.
look at default items.xml
Alright
or how do I make custom achivements
How do I make an item appear only when an achievement is unlocked
No, bomb is not spawning
Cool thanks
i will try it
lol
It only added the costume.
aaand
I did.
just add the item
Item and familiar actually
Familiar
Could you see if it summons it for you
like item, familiar, or just + 1 life

Hey guys I have an idea for a group of trinkets and cards. I'm really new to modding / this API, so on a scale of Passive Fly to Sisters Vis pre-patch, how difficult would making 4 new suits of cards, and 10 trinkets that force certain room types to be on each floor be?

everything under Config is not properly implemented yes, useless
idk
Thats not even working
<@135254843567767552> so this is useless

ok
No keys at all
Nope
time to upload
movie is done
<:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
haha
Good idea
Why dont you test it?
so it will drop 1-2 golden keys correct?
<@195368190333812736>  yes
use a for loop from 0 to random?
the Config classes aren't implemented or are at least inaccessible
is that it
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,,math.random(1,2),PickupVariant.PICKUP_KEY, KeySubType.KEY_GOLDEN,Vector(player.Position.X-1, player.Position.Y-1), Vector(0,0), player)
Also how to make it so that gives you a random amount of the item?
saxarok i'm pretty sure we have nothing in the api available to check any information about anything item related programmatically
that is what i need
How to find a devil deal price of an item?
The range isnt big enough

Not rolling the right numbers in Math.random

OHH
<@195368190333812736>  idk

like is it IsCollectible()
so how?
it will help me
but
it's not what i need
how to check if an item is a trinket or collectible
?
I have a question
guys
yeah
debug 8?
How to give yourself unlimited charges in Console for debugging?
there's actually an enums.lua that's easier and more descriptive than trying to use the browser docs
Yeah I did that
to  find something
why? because i made the code in like 3 seconds and i knew it was -1
<@195368190333812736>  u can use ctrl+f in your browser
yes
Or am I missing something there?
Also, why -1? Shouldn't that be Direction.NO_DIRECTION for the firing check?
oh
PICKUP_KEY = 30
Found it
or something
in enum.h
I dont know where it is
Whats the Pickup Varient for keys?
https://www.lua.org/pil/3.2.html
<@130188705498529792> i think yes
ok cool thanks
<@247117031575519232> yeah. assuming you havent deleted your metadata.xml in the mean time
yeah
So I take it ~= is sort of like "Not Equals" in Lua, or what?
Hello, just a quick question. I have an update for my mod, how do I upload the update to the steam workshop? Do I use the mod uploader tool again? Don't want to accidently upload the mod twice so I thought I'd double check ?
divide your code into a lot of functions
<@109624258317033472>  you can use functions
Take your time with it, make it as great as it can be!
id love to do it as a challenge, but id need the "goto" command accessible in lua
<@70946604139425792> Thanks a lot! im still shaking from all the positive feedback i get from here and on twitter c: Its probably on the workshop in 1-2 days
like examples?
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_config_1_1_item.html#a3df37f50dde6a76a6acb360ed6905e88
how to use those
Probably the most impressive thing I've seen done so far
i'm very confused
its not 100% done yet, but its coming together ^^
can someone help me with this https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_config_1_1_item.html#a3df37f50dde6a76a6acb360ed6905e88
i have so much shitty video to edit fml
*Very* nice, wow
yeah ?
You created some analogue of the original Pacman's ghost behavior in AB+'s API?
<@109624258317033472> "With the ghost behaviour from the original Pacman!"
yeah, it's it
https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Coins_(Pickup)#1.2B1_Free_Penny
Yeah.
<@195368190333812736> ?
Sounds reasonable.
Is it COIN_DOUBLEPACK
Anyone know what 1+1 Free Penny is
and another question, how to add seed effect to run, like dyslexia effect
``player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(COSTUME, true)`` maybe that?
And then nothing
It only gives you the costume for one room
annnd, what is wrong with ``player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect()``
from what i've gathered from others discussing it not every item gives you the effects of the items, only some. no idea what would cause the inconsistency
It just gives me the costume.
Is player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect() bugged for anyone else?
idk
isnt there an update supposed to come today?
okay
oh
<@223869207748542464> youd probably need to wait until this is featured in the API ?
<@109624258317033472>  i just don't want it to be hardcoded
for future updates i want that
currently adding it to poll is not easily possible, but
i want to include it too
and yeah Scayze hopefully they fix the item pool stuff in this upcoming update
but if mod add an item do devil deal
how to update mod ingame with console?
array with all devil deal items
```lua
if player:GetFireDirection() ~= -1 then
        local x = 0
        local y = 0
        if player:GetFireDirection() == Direction.LEFT then
            x = 1
        elseif player:GetFireDirection() == Direction.RIGHT then
            x = -1
        elseif player:GetFireDirection() == Direction.UP then
            y = 1
        elseif player:GetFireDirection() == Direction.DOWN then
            y = -1
        end
        if math.random() < 0.02 then
            player:FireBrimstone(Vector(x,y))
        end
    end```
i can make an array(or what they called[i'm learning c++ not lua so...])
Here's an example <https://files.catbox.moe/22ckj4.mp4>
damn. i doubt this is possible with the current state of the API. youd probably need to read everything from the itempool.xml with a script or sth. and hardcode it into your lua code
```
function sugmod:PocketDevilDeal_use( )

local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
local repeatTHISC = 0
  while repeatTHISC == 0 do 
    local RandItem = math.random(1, CollectibleType.NUM_COLLECTIBLES)
    if RandItem.DevilPrice != nil then
      player:AddMaxHearts(RandItem.DevilPrice-RandItem.DevilPrice-RandItem.DevilPrice, false)
      player:AddCollectible(RandItem, 0, true)
      repeatTHISC = 1
    end  
  end
end
```
i need to take random item from devil deal pool
<@223869207748542464> could be that the Standard devil price is 1
Well, I guess that non-neutral firing position thing could work
if not i'm generating another one
i'm trying to get random item and check if it has devil price
samiam that's rather possible, let me see if i can do that real quick
```
local RandItem = math.random(1, CollectibleType.NUM_COLLECTIBLES)
if RandItem.DevilPrice != nil then
```
so, can someone solve my problem?
code?
Im getting update.it now
that 1 won't work))
haha
oh
i just said
if number > 1 and number < 2 then
Like that
and if the number is between 10-20
So like it rolls a number
Anyway that's pretty cool stuff you did there
<@195368190333812736> what does you mean?
Might even make it the Lil' Brim beam if possible, though I'd rather have something that makes sense first
if number >1 and <2 then
That's REALLY AWESOME!
How to select a section of numbers
Well, I'd try to make it go off pretty rarely anyway
thanks man ?
*Tweet
Any tear, though it goes off pretty rarely
Wow that is really cool looking, just saw the tween Scayze!
https://twitter.com/ThatScayze/status/818498604784615424
backwards brimstone while the player is firing ANY tear or their own brimstone?
Pacman
what is your mod about?
My mod got retweeted by Edmund fsdklsfdlf my life is now complete
but this is not working
```
local RandItem = math.random(1, CollectibleType.NUM_COLLECTIBLES)
if RandItem.DevilPrice != nil then
```
Backwards Brimstone while player is firing (goes off at random intervals, but only when player is firing). Probably a bit too tall of an order, but still.
Im not sure
and i tried to
i need to take item from devil deal pool
how to take random item from any pool
And i have a question!
<@130188705498529792>  What are you trying to make? like describe it
and for brimstone there's the getactiveweaponentity for when it's firing and such
there are other work arounds like if shooting direction isn't neutral and the firedelay is equal to maxfiredelay you've just fired
it's not a perfect solution though
what i do for that check is a check for a tear type entity with the player as a parent
Not that it would be that easy in the first place necessarily but still
Like, I'm seeing lots of booleans under the EntityPlayer thing, but nothing that's explicitly "Player is shooting tears now?"
yes))
Yeah I think you were thinking of Mom's Contact or something
i'm dumb))
oh
ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
Or something?
Wait, that is Mom's Eye
No wait, I mean the one that has Isaac fire out the back of his head
and do it in damage callback
and then do Effect on enemy that is hit with tear
<@130188705498529792>  you need to make function that checks if isaac has ur item
<@268036083827212290> only russians use ))?
I guess the equivalent would be like Mom's Eye
<@130188705498529792>
what are you trying to make?
Or is it more complicated than that?
Is there a reference like "Player is shooting" that can be used?
?
with no eyes
i know
oh god russian emotes
yes
is vector
))
the word you're looking for
vector
"thingy"
It's the velocity of object when spawned
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL,THIS_IS_YOUR_POSITION_THINGY_POSITION_OF_OBJECT_YOU_WILL_SPAWN, VELOCITY_THINGY, player)
After THAT you have VELOCITY_THINGY
Okay Cool got it
Vector(player.Position.X-2, player.Position.Y+10)
like
position
with
you can replace position thingy
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL,THIS_IS_YOUR_POSITION_THINGY_POSITION_OF_OBJECT_YOU_WILL_SPAWN, Vector(0,0), player)
where something will be spawned
in it you have thingy that needs position
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN, CoinSubType.COIN_NICKEL,Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y), Vector(0,0), player)
this is you spawn thingy
dude...
or Vector(0,0)
Wait so do I replace room:GetCenterPos()
to add space after plr
You can do it like that
Ohh
Like that?
Vector(player.Position.X-2, player.Position.Y+10)
local MyMod = RegisterMod("A Greeds Guide", 1)
local GreedGuide =  Isaac.GetItemIdByName("A Greeds Guide")

end

MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod.UseMod, GreedGuide )
and you can do like
Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y)
Yes
Ahh
with
you need to replace position
yeah
if you want to spawn something next to plr
oh
replace position with player.Position
Next to
in case of in player
like 1 or 2 spaces away
in player, or next to player
Also how do I make it spawn next to the player
Yeah
1 not
2 and 3 will work
100%
1 is n't working!
haha
what?
I dont know what one it is
3 people told me that
if x > 3 and x < 10 then
or
if number >= 0 and number < 10 then
or
Will that work
if number >=1 and <=10 then
1 more question
Is working
Oh
hold a sec
coin
Yah its not spawning the code
<@195368190333812736>  ur code looks working!
i will try ur code
why you are using <
oh, i know <@!182509747835109387>
i'm thinking
yes, i know
It still doesn't fix the problem though.
you can make random nubmer between min and max
yes!
math.random takes parameters in Lua?
and ``elseif randTech == 2 then``
why not use ``local randTech = math.random(1, 4)``
?
you are smart))
no
))
yes, please wait
Im dumb
strange ``local randTech = math.floor(math.random()*4)  ``
<@223869207748542464> Can you help me again?

AHH What have I done wrong!
hmm?
just `break` after you place a bomb to early out of the loop?
haha its all good
but i can say that
i can't help you
so...
<@99332493852839936> i tried to make something with specific enemies, but i couldn't find out how to make it
ok
instead of just 1
and that all works, except its summoning a bomb for each enemy in the room
if the rng roll correct
The intention is for it down check for vulnerable entities, if so then check for bff then spawn a bomb under the familiar
<@195368190333812736>  yes
<@99332493852839936> what does the code needs to do?
local MyMod = RegisterMod("A Greeds Guide", 1)
local GreedGuide =  Isaac.GetItemIdByName("A Greeds Guide")

  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local number = math.random(1, 2)

vel with Vector(0, 0)
u need to replace:
where do I put that

yes
could you help me with programming instead?

but some of the enemies we're using as a base don't have big enough frames
i'm reskinning some enemies
yes
can someone help me with something?
Oh, not tech y, tech
and send you code
i will make a check
of tech Y
so if you enter a room you get a cosutme
And you didn't make check to your item
Yes.
<@!182509747835109387>  are you here?

now i see
and, oh
from code
``            prevRoom = room:GetDecorationSeed(); ``
and you deleted
i'm working on your problem
dude
Wait
Help.
<@223869207748542464> Your code is broken.
HEART_HALF_SOUL,
look in the documentation
is
And a sub type for that
PICKUP_HEART
Like hearts is
Whats the type for Coins
I use Vector(2,0) for my mods so they don't directly spawn on Isaac.
or -
<@168775690152443925>  using that as a position
``Vector(player.Position.X+SOMETHING, player.Position.Y+SOMETHING)``
Aye!
Oh no
Ayeverybody!
Just set the vector to something other than (0,0).
yeah
how do i spawn something around an entity rather than on them?
<@!182509747835109387> Oh
after EntityType comes EntityVariant and EntitySubtype <@195368190333812736>
Like that?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,1,room:GetCenterPos(),Vector(0,0),player)
))
<@195368190333812736>  do ``player.Position``
Ahh let me see If I can fix it
<@223869207748542464>  [INFO] - [Tech All] Error in PostUpdate call: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/tech all/main.lua:6: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetDecorationSeed')
if u need a player pos
<@195368190333812736> 
again, you messed up with position
Now it doesn't even give me the costume.
that's wrong
yes
``Game():GetRoom():GetCenterPos()``
Will this spawn a Penny I think I have the format wrong
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,1, position,Vector(0,0),player
yes
oh
?
<@223869207748542464> Do you mean 
```lua
Game():GetRoom():GetCenterPos()
```
Then, when I get the item, it does nothing.
``Game():GetRoom():room:GetCenterPos()``
It gives me the costume before I even get the item.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Tech All",1)
local techall = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Tech All")
function mod:EnterRoom()
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  room = Game():GetRoom()
  currRoom = room:GetDecorationSeed()
  player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_TECHNOLOGY,true)
  local randTech = math.floor(math.random()*5)
  if prevRoom ~= currRoom then
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.EnterRoom,EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
```
Why is that red?
Game():GetRoom():room:GetCenterPos() by doing that
What does it do?
Game():GetRoom():room:GetCenterPos() by doing that
What does it do?
if you want u can remove it
Thanks you so much!
Yep works
<@195368190333812736>  and i added something, local var called room
this code is 100% working
Ahh Ill try it again thanks
room:GetCenterPos()
room:GetCenterPos
i think you just not placed the brakets
Here's a hint for you <@195368190333812736> it's a PICKUP
Why is it not working for me?
This works

Im going to do something else like spawn money
No Im just wondering becuase I dont the bosses they are just place holders
For center, you'd need, hmhmhm
No, that'd make the boss spawn at the player
Oh
of the room
Cool so will that make the Boss spawn in the center
Replace all Spawn ``Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_DUKE,0,0,position,Vector(0,0),player)``
to 
``Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_DUKE,0,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)``

that makes it so you use player instead of Isaac yes
<@223869207748542464> Do I use   local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
more like movie breaker
I don't know how to use Adobe Prim so I have to use movie maker

Robobaby bad
Our school computers gives us all Adobe Programs
you seem enthusiastic
I SURE DO LOVE EDTING VIDEOS IN WINDOWS LIVE MOIVE MAKERRRR

Half of that code is just Little knowlage
Oh, your code looked *too good*
did somebody say know how to code?
I just watch a few tutorials I dont really know anything
haha
Also, <@195368190333812736>, where the hell did you come from and why do you know how to code? The next thing I know I'll have to compete with you D:<
ahh
in your spawn
u need to replace 
position with player.Position
Unless you want it to spawn on top of the player
I mean, that'd be resonable
no
do I need to include local position = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position, 100)
haha
Fix my code too please.
i will fix your code, wait a sec
Do I need to do anything with the player position of just tell the game to find it
Ah, right
you need to player.Position

You can't just say "Oh, but I don't need c, so I'm going to do `function(a, b, d)` so when I call it like `f(1,2,3,4)` then it should pass `1, 2` and `4`"
Then it's a, b, c in order
If a function is `function(a, b, c)`
basically
params are inputed
how are you supposed to check a param anyway lmao
I didn't have to add parameters to the last mod I made with it.
<@126590786945941504> How I get the entity if dmg_target is a parameter and it changes every time?
I used windows movie maker once
I mean
If you don't check
I honeslty forgot it existed
It'll either make your video 320x240 or 4k
That's one thing that absolutely sucks in WMM
Make sure you get the right resolution and double-check when exporting
Also beware saving
<@!267112861921181697> if you want just super basic video editing, you can try out "Windows live Movie maker". it has pretty much no functions but it does its job ?
that exists
oh yeah
<@!267112861921181697> Is Windows Movie Maker not enough?
<@!182509747835109387> No, the interpreter will automatically guess what you need and scramble the arguments around for you
Text editing and cutting between scenes
<@!267112861921181697> What kind of editting do you need?
I have no fucking clue how to use Adobe Prim
I need all of them even if I don't use them?
Read your enums.lua
^
Does anyone know any easy to use free video editors?
`-- Callback is a method that takes (TookDamage : Entity, DamageAmount : number, DamageFlag : number (bit flags from DamageFlag enumeration), DamageSource : EntityRef, DamageCountdownFrames : number). `

There are multiple log.txts?
As in, if you're using something that's worked to other people before, I doubt it's the game derping out without erroring
or it's the wrong log.txt
Or it's not an error, which is a rare possibility
If it never displays any errors, then you either aren't reloading your mod or you can't read
I changed the rocks but I can't find the basement grid
log,txt never displays any errors for me.
Elaborate
how 2 edit room floor
Check your log.txt
Because I can't seem to do anything.
Can someone else check if player.Die() and player.Kill() work?
m a y b e
only upward maybe
go damn it ive been trying to just search the room class type and its been in the wrong place
someone answer pls
"if we're reskinning an enemy can we change the frame size
so we have more space to edit the sprite and make it bigger"
Bullshitting here, but I think Isaac.GetRoom()
what is the class for get room though
then save the variable again
Yes.
get isaacs current room and save it to a variable,  check if that variable is not the same as the room and if so do some code
<@168775690152443925> I'm pretty sure there's RoomShape
how do i write a function that checks if the room has changed and then does something
I had an idea for this mod for like 2 years.
Will this work?
player:UseCard(Card.CARD_SUICIDE_KING)
Lol.
Do I deserve ban or something like this?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838944495
then reduce Isaac's health to zero and spawn a monster tear to kill him
player:Die() and player:Kill() both don't work.
so we have more space
if we're reskinning an enemy can we change the frame size
or revival
¯\_(?)_/¯
3 second delay
oh yeah
<@!267112861921181697>  About Plan C, you kill final boss and jump into chest(or something)
holy passives
I am trying to think of good passive items
then I dunno
player:Kill() doesn't work either.
would count as a loss
you die tho
but
You can beat a hard final boss.
Whats the point of Plan C?
Also
kk
But I'll try it.
I think kill is only for enemies.
player:Kill() isntead
Yeah, Die doesn't work.
Take a look at my code for example
There is a die.
```function MyMod:use_slingshot( )
    local     player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local     entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsFlying() == true then
            entities[ i ]:Kill()
        end
    end
    return true
end```
I'm pretty sure its kill not die
Is player:Die() bugged?
?
just make it so when a variable updates it kills isaac
lol
I have a challenges.xml with the Onan's Streak part.
I'm just focusing on the item right now.
your just telling the item to kill isaac
you never said the onans streak part
So... does anyone know what's wrong with my code?
Edmund said an update was coming today
did the API update?
Yes, when you give it the metadata, it detects that it's on the store.
thats all? ok
And put in patch notes.
You reupload it.
Hey guys. How would one update there mod?
am back
Hello
Nope
oh, wait a sec
anyone?
``mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG,mod.death, nil)``? Maybe that will fix it
It still doesn't work.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Onan's Streak EXTREME")
local instantdeath = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Instant Death")
function mod:death(dmg_target, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and dmg_source == 0 and player:HasCollectible(instantdeath) and dmg_target:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
    player:Die()
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG,mod.death)
```
how would i write a function that does something on room change?
Oh.
It's `dmg_target:IsVulnerableEnemy()`
The last `and` makes no sense
and, also
Yeah, that too
I'm dumb.
Oh, I need double equals
Not sure if dmg_dealer is the tear or the player
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Onan's Streak EXTREME")
local instantdeath = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Instant Death")
function mod:death(dmg_target, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and dmg_source == 0 and player:HasCollectible(instantdeath) and dmg_target = Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
    player:Die()
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG,mod.death)
```
This is my code.
It doesn't work.
I'll try to get it so that Isaac dies when a tear hits an enemy first.
and save every tear that hit an enemy in it
define a table outside of scope of every function and without "local"
But how do I keep track of every tear?
or remember every tear that hits an enemy, and if an tear gets missing without haveing hit an enemy, -> kill isaac
HAVE FUN LUUL
Only if it hits an enemy
measure the walls with RenderText and player.Position, and hardcode it
<@223869207748542464> Yeah, but you can't trigger the function every time Isaac's tear hits something.
need a lot of fine tuning tho
when the finish flying
you  can check if the tear hits an enemy, if not isaac dies
I figured out player:Die(), but I don't know how to do the wall stuff.
I guess you check the position of the tears
you gotta go hacky
hard
hm
If a tear hits the wall, Isaac dies.
what do you wanna do with the wall
Only the floor
But position and velocity won't tell me if they hit a wall.
And it's not that bad of a hack
no callbacks for tears
They can't account for everything you might want to do, at least not immediately
That's kinda how my bombs stuff works ¯\_(?)_/¯
that's the modding api
That sounds overly complex.
And you can know where it hit and from what direction
Then run a trace with whatever function you find
yea
If a tear is gone, check position and last velocity
Save all the tears every tick
You probably could do, like
yes I do HeyGuys
Also
whats the function for checking if the room changed?
D:
From my mods
People actually recognize me
Oh dear, I've gone deep enough that there's no escape
no idea how to do this
wow
Including the walls and floors.
Yes, but I need it to trigger when Isaac's tears hit anything.
"MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG"
But the floor and walls aren't entities
just don't check it?
How do I say if the damage target is any entity?
I don't what you're trying to do but dmg_source == 0 won't do anything ever
<@120355885615808512> So I need dmg_source = player instead of dmg_source=0?
Can someone help me?
I need to take random item from devil deal poll, i tried everything, but nothing works
Hi
thanks
ooh ok
you use it with only one ":"
that's just the definition
nah its not?
then the resource on the website is wrong probs
ah well
Oh, I forgot a for loop.
2 ":"
yes
Is something wrong here?

if Level::GetStage () == LevelStage.STAGE1_1 then
you have to use DamageSource.Entity
probably because DamageSource is an EntityRef
It still doesn't work.
Okay, thanks.
just change MC_POST_UPDATE to MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
Then how do I do this?
Oh.
**no arguments**
MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG     
Callback is a method that takes (TookDamage : Entity, DamageAmount : number, DamageFlag : number (bit flags from DamageFlag enumeration), DamageSource : EntityRef, DamageCountdownFrames : number). Return true or nil if the entity or player should sustain the damage, otherwise false to ignore it. If the entity is an EntityPlayer, the DamageAmount is the integer number of half-hearts of damage that the player will take. Otherwise, DamageAmount is a number of hit points. Called before new damage is applied. A DAMAGE_COUNTDOWN flag means the entity will ignore any other DAMAGE_COUNTDOWN hits for the duration specified. When adding callback, specify an EntityType to respond to only damage taken by that entity type.
MC_POST_UPDATE     
Callback is a method with no arguments. Called after game update.
They work on my other mods.
so you cannot use them
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/group___enumerations.html#ga84d8f7ea5c80b37ad1c55b2a97286eb1
but then they won't do anything
yes
It can have parameters.
It's just declaring a function.
which?
Update can have parameters.
update has no parameters I think
yes
i guarantee it
not in this callback
No, I've used those parameters for a mod before.
^
sounds like on damage
update has parameters dmg_target, dmg_amount, dmg_source, dmg_dealer??
The item doesn't work.
whats the problem
what
What is wrong with this code?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Onan's Streak EXTREME")
local instantdeath = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Instant Death")
function mod:death(dmg_target, dmg_amount, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
  if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and dmg_source == 0 and player:HasCollectible(instantdeath) and dmg_target != entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
    player:Die()
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.death)
```
herro
Hello
does it load the stat to need modified?
could someone please explain me what the cacheFlag enum is?
oh
In the tools directory
Use the mod uploader
how to upload mods to steam workshop?
ohhhhhh
yes
are the aces new?
oh
two of hearts doubles your current health and ace of hearts converts all consumables in a room to hearts
but theres also a diamonds_2, spades_2, etc along with ace_of_spades etc
well maybe
its probs two of hearts
at least that's what I would excpect it to be
isn't hearts_2 the lovers?
as in CARD_HEARTS_2 and CARD_ACE_OF_HEARTS
is there a difference between the cards ace of hearts and hearts 2?
Does anyone know what .anm2 file uses images from character menu?
and will go through them in order until the end?
so ipairs only work with things that have 1, 2, 3 and so on as keys?
with no holes
an "array" table is a table that has integer indexes starting from 1
`ipairs` will iterate every single key in an "array" table
and for each iteration return the key and value
<@168775690152443925> `pairs` will iterate every single key in the table
Its not possible right now right?
like, a new item
yeah i will so what is the main difference from ``ipairs`` and ``pairs``
How do I add an item into the item pool?
but do it how I showed you
that returns two strings which you can then `tonumber`
Can't find anything in docs.
`("5.5, -5.5"):match("([^,]*), (.*)")`
<@168775690152443925> but just for the sake of "why not"
Is there a way to make an entity collide with player?
3. `ipairs` uses the above, it starts at integer key `1` and goes up until it finds a nil; it'll also result in increased performance
<@228680372215349249> Hope Edmund it will make easier
2. if you don't provide names for keys in a table (`pos1`, `pos2`) they'll just be integers starting from 1
wow... i totally overlooked the fact that i can use anything in a table...
1. you can just create vectors and then store them, you don't need to put everything in strings and create a vector at the last moment (in fact, the above will result in increased performance)
some things to consider:
```lua
postable = {
  Vector(5.5, 5.5),
  Vector(7.5, 0),
  Vector(5.5, -5.5),
  Vector(0, 7.5),
  Vector(0, -7.5),
  Vector(-5.5, 5.5),
  Vector(-7.5, 0),
  Vector(-5.5, -5.5)
}
for i, v in ipairs(postable) do
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 1, 0, player.Position, v, player)
end
```
...
`GetMaxPoketItems`
probably because im not good with code
instead of this:
would you do that
<@168775690152443925> why the hell
according to the docs isn't "LevelStage" a variable that keeps track of what floor you're in?
<@141237286162530304> what?
uh can't figure out
<@268036083827212290> this is what im trying to do
```
postable = {pos1 = '5.5, 5.5', pos2 = '7.5, 0', pos3 = '5.5, -5.5', pos4 = '0, 7.5', pos5 = '0, -7.5', pos6 = '-5.5, 5.5', pos7 = '-7.5, 0', pos8 = '-5.5, -5.5'}
        for k, v in pairs(postable) do
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 1, 0, player.Position, Vector(v), player)
```
okay
when I finish it
I'll play around with it and I'll give you code
tonumber doesn't know how you want to convert that string into a number
i figured
well, yeah, that's because of the comma there
I can't figure out how to modify MaxFireDelay
tonumber always comes out as nil
sorry
yes
`5.5` and `-5.5`?
to two numbers?
you mean
how would i go about turning a string like this``'5.5, -5.5'`` to a number?
<@141237286162530304> You can test the seed of the room. If it changes, it's a new room. You can check the type of the room (if it's a treasure room), then check the floor (or set a treasure room flag), then find a collectible entity, then replace it with `5.100.YOURITEMID`
ah ok, thank you
no but you can use the in game console to give you your item its giveitem and it will probably be c511 for your item
<@267673192372371467> it's kind of stupid, you have to override the whole character menu :(
last question, is there a way to force the first item pedestal to spawn with the new item, for test's sake?
ah i see
<@141237286162530304> you cant the game does that for you
Hi! I´m making a new character, I have sprites and animations for character menu, but still don ´t work, how should I add a new characterr to Isaac, withoout replacing someone?
wait, how do you set your new item's ID?
hmm. no actual z offset for sprites :(
how can i set the value in a table to 2 floating points?
:D
big thanks to <@150336707609231362>
<@132569939969179648> get to general
chompy boys are live
because of the texture pack that i'm making kek
eyoo http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838809859
i was thinking if was me
oh ok
<@124088844181045249>
who?
honestly the fact that he used that animation for the new spidey makes me sad ?
Take it to <#205854501083545601> :)
It's fine that you don't enjoy the DLC, but don't ruin this for the people that do
and that texture pack its just a joke haha
but i dont like it
i dont hate the dlc
Is there a way to play 'hurt' animation on demand?
guys please don't start a stupid fight over who finds more value in what.
I'm sorry you can't handle people grilling your awful DLC
this is for modding support
if you have to, take it to <#205854501083545601>
^
please
leave it
you only complain
It's honestly getting really annoying to listen to the haters
<@97356230934138880> yes i know you have to assign two floats but im trying to make a table to assign those floats without typing the ``Isaac.Spawn`` class.
You mean the part that I already had and didn't pay $6.66 for
Is that unfinished too?
What about all of the rest of the game
It's not like AB+ is completely unfinished or anything
Yeah I'm overly critical
I think you're overly critical of the devs
Edmund considering adding an actually-useful item? holy butts
<@!174193097285173250> Your mod will make the game
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/818529429924167682
yeah it's only been in development since October 2015, give it time guys
my textue pack 10/10
"the API is still very young"
1.5s?
what's the length of the default mercy time?
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/818523139151794176
define a vector as Vector(float,float)
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/818521782399299584
so I cant seem to get this to work
```
postable = {pos1 = '5.5, 5.5', pos2 = '7.5, 0', pos3 = '5.5, -5.5', pos4 = '0, 7.5', pos5 = '0, -7.5', pos6 = '-5.5, 5.5', pos7 = '-7.5, 0', pos8 = '-5.5, -5.5'}
        for k, v in pairs(postable) do
          Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 1, 0, player.Position, Vector(v), player)
```
It keeps telling me the the value of Vector is expected a number and got a string, im assuming the issues has to do with me puttin the 5.5, 5.5 inside these ' ' but i ont know how else to get them in the table.
what's the relationship between tear height and numerical range?
thanks a lot
<@141237286162530304> documents/my games/the binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods
remote debugging has been broken because the modding api no longer allows requires
must be dumb
that i can't find either really
they're in the same place your put your own mods
yeah, but i can't find the saved location for the downloaded mods
there are some dev examples on the steam workshop & you could also just look at the lua for anyone else's mod that you download
It always gives me an error on launch.
The debugging sucks.
Does anyone know how to use the remote debugging in Zerobrane ?
Do anyone know how to change to a different character for a custom challenge?
someone said there's gonna be one today
where/when is the update FlipThis TableHere
and workshop stuff is saved in?
i thought there were some game assets already but i guess that works
ah ok
since i never really coded in lua so i wanted to take a look
Yes, download some stuff.
There is documentation to make your own stuff.
isnt there like some sample stuff to look at
that you write
starts in a main.lua file
you make your own
i mean where is the actual script i'd need to edit to create new items and such
I think id changes character but I'm not sure.
Does anyone know all the arguments that the challenges xml file takes?
well you can but you cant use it to right new Lua items.
Yes, you can only use the API.
its in c++ if i remember right and you cant use it for modding.
Does anyone know all the arguments that the challenges xml file takes?
where is the actual code for the game? lol
might be a bit derpy but
can someone quickly fill me in
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838823776 my second mod =]
never mind haha
writing ```
t = {[pos1] = (1, -1)} 
```
gives me an error.
<:plum:259939492008296448>
how would i write it of i want a table to contain the value ``1, -1`` in a key?
I think I just spotted it
`Game():GetPlayer():HasCollectible(COLLECTIBLE_IMMORTALITY)` is there something wrong with this snippet?
and then I somehow can't query for HasCollectible using the same ID
I can spawn an item with an ID just fine
I don't get it
god damn it robobaby
<@116386733905412105> a tear that i spawned manually :/
thanks
that was in the documentation
Room& Level::GetCurrentRoom    (        )    

?
how do you find the Room Index for a room?
upgrade your range stat?
How would i change the range of a spawned tear entity ?
i dont think he has any
it was just random
i dont actually expect anyone to XD
sell some steam cards
idk
Why do you ask us? lol
lmao who wants to give my friend like $2 so he can buy rebirth afterbirth and ab+
thanks ?
No, it returns 0.75
Lua question: does 3/4 return an int ?
nada
what
immortality you lytebringr copy cat ?
```
M_Immortality:AddCallback(Isaac.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, M_Immortality.onDMGTaken)
M_Immortality:AddCallback(Isaac.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, M_Immortality.onEvalCache)
M_Immortality:AddCallback(Isaac.MC_POST_UPDATE , M_Immortality.debugInit)
```
these are the three callbacks
maybe Mom secretly murdered someone and put them in a bag and isaac found the bag
idk
so, the second argument for AddCallback is an int, but I've seen it skipped and now lua is complaining that I didn't put a proper argument there without even specifying which callback if referred to
Gotta keep the streets clean
Clean up ?
That have blood left on them
Why would anyone put bones in a bag
ok
uh
They aren't
why are my words colored!!!
i got it from spriting ?

I think you have to actually join a voice channel

no .. ???
can you hear instruments randomly playing?
uh
yeah all the time
does anyone actually use the voice chat in here?

does the game specify the error anywhere

<@173380286183112705> remove update.it or disable.it
How to prevent the game from tagging the mod as `[old]`
holy shit <@109624258317033472> nice work
Quick question: How do you find a specific room for you to teleport to using ChangeRoom?
new to lua, when do  I use `:` and when `.` to invoke functioons
Y'all want an sneak peak at my mod? https://twitter.com/ThatScayze/status/818498604784615424
does not work well unfortunately
using a punching bag as a background entity for damage detection
btw
lower capped at 0 I assume
FireDelay in player is the current fire delay which decreases each frame
but it's `MaxFireDelay` in the player
not sure if this works tho
it's `firedelay` in the `cache` attr
you could change the collision Mass of ones object
<@173380286183112705> note
And, hm, not sure if you can get the direction from that
But you could use the entity damage callback
Not sure about a proper way
anybody know how to increase knockback?
not
yay for consistency
speed
so is it `speed` or `movespeed` then
or similar
`cache="damage range luck"`
as far as I understand it, you need to add what stat will be affected
but it's simply stat names with spaces in between
halfway
is what there needs to be in the cache field in the items.xml documented anywhere?
I guess it must've been crashing before
weird
it is called on continue
nevermind
I mean stat flags
tbh
Or just don't pass it and check the stats yourself
v a r i a b l e s
Either pass a passive item ID
since the game demands to know
but the callback takes the argument specifying what type of stats are being changed and EvaluateCache takes no arguments, so how do I specify which stats I want my MC_CACHE callback to affect
to disable a mod
just `touch disable.it`
I like the `update.it`/`disable.it` stuff
Are you sure it isn't simply erroring or something?
In my experience
It doesn't register an item the player should have
let me test again
how do you make it so when you use the explode function on an entity that it does a specific death explosion?
It's definitely called on new game and restart
It is being called, but I don't think it works like it should
That's weird, I've tested
You aren't?
<@126590786945941504> I'm not seeing post_player_init being called on continue?
`:`
so I have to call it with player.EvaluateCache
Technically you should use PEFFECT
also
just the current delay
But sometimes you want to change stats continuously
my only current problem with tear stat mods is that i can't seem to change the max tear fire delay
Yeah, that's the proper way
but still
it seems to work outside
I have a callback to the MC_CACHE thing
yeah
the docs say to only edit player stats in mc_evaluate_cache
I think the most hygienic way to do that would be to manually cause a cache evaluation
is it easy to spawn creep?
Done
Apply in cache and when damage is taken
So what's the problem?
Increment it every time you take damage
I know
Store a local variable
You can do that
Yes
kek
let's say I want to apply a speed down every time I take damage
"Boohoo the game uses a proper system now I need to know how to code"
Only updates stats when it needs to
I must know how
How else would you propose it to work?
Why are so many people so salty
Not that dumb, to be honest
"dumb"
since isaac uses the dumb cache system to change stats
yes =]
<@97356230934138880> does that effect tears?
lmfao
yea
okay
"Lua 5.2 was released on 16 Dec 2011."
?

thx
...
so wait does lua have goto now?
is it possible to  make an entity fly?
my first item =]
http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=838756002
Though not sure if faster than upvalues
although I remember something about globals being kinda-locals since lua something
Yeah, they are
also locals are faster I think?
But it's good practice and will help avoid mod conflicts
You don't technically need to do `local varname` even
thanks
<@173380286183112705> Yes, just do `local varname` outside of any function
but less error prone
`break` and `continue` is literally goto
Which breaks/continues the specified loop
well
can you have cross-callback variables?
But it has `break label` and `continue label`
Because JS doesn't have goto
TBH if there's one thing I love JS for, it's labels
oh neat.
luajit even has it backported
Isaac uses 5.3
since 5.2
5.2 beta
lua does have goto
dude
http://lua-users.org/wiki/GotoStatement
oh I see it's only in the beta
probably for the best
lua doesn't have goto
heh
use goto ?
coroutines tho
nvm, doesn't seem like it
Doesn't 5.3 have continue or something?
``If continue existed, it would have to be restricted semantically to be only valid after all of the variables used in the condition have come into scope. This is a difficult condition to document to the user and enforce in the compiler.``

if Entity.EntityType == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER or something like that
how to check if the entity passed in MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback is the player?
well back for me
oh it's back
downforeveryoneorjustme.com
up for me
It's up
is StackOverflow down ?
Hell, I don't know any case where you need the total number of elements of both parts
AFAIK there's no case where you'd need # and you need the total number of elements of an array, both the array and hash parts
thanks for the link
So they'll revert back to the default after the animation is done
Alright, now I know. Cool
Just had a look at it, it's because the tear animations aren't set to loop
Don't use # if you don't want #
Basically
*sigh*
don't use the # for tables that aren't pretending to be arrays
basically
Then the length is n
And no key n+1
If you have keys 1, 2, 3, ..., n
in any case
Apparently it's not about nil, but being defined
No
will reliably return 3
I guess keys 1, 3, and 5
ok so
All are numerical, there are no nils in there
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36847797/how-does-luas-table-length-operator-work
The array part is a series of n unbroken keys from 1 to n
not gonna ask i'll actually learn lua here :p
I thought it was the same
how does it work differnt? I actually dont know
The length operator `#table` returns the size of the **array** part of the table
But basically
BTW guys, do you know what `arr` is in this code?
because of the nature of #table
And don't tell us what the code is
<@116386733905412105> why wont it?
Ask us about the code
Yes, look at some code
*sigh*
i was looking at a "table library"
#table will not reliably return the value 3
no
if I have a table where the keys 1, 3, and 5 all have values
he means table.Length(i think)
tableLength isn't a Lua function
hold on
uh #table doesn't always function the same
nope
...tableLength?
is there a difference between #table and tableLength(table) ?
not entity_tear
he replaced entity_projectile
(Unless he screwed up and didn't override it at all)
Probably because it replays the animation
But the game appears to play the animation for the other tear anyways
which is in the same spritesheet
He's trying to replace the tear
I thought he was just trying to use the bigger tear
Right?
He's not replacing the spritesheet tho
yeah, got to replace the sprite sheet
Where `gfx/items/pick ups/pickup_016_bomb_rock.png` is a modified `gfx/items/pick ups/pickup_016_bomb.png`
itd be easy to make a familiar that kills itself right?
If you want an example, here's how rockbombs does it with bombs ```lua
            if v.Type == entBombType and not bombs[v.Index] and v.SpawnerType == 1 then
                local sprite = v:GetSprite()
                bombs[v.Index] = {bomb=v, sprite=sprite, dmg=v.ExplosionDamage or ply.Damage}
                sprite:ReplaceSpritesheet(0, "gfx/items/pick ups/pickup_016_bomb_rock.png")
                sprite:LoadGraphics()
                --v:GetSprite():Play("Idle")
            end```
If the game sets the animation, it won't just work
I saw broskiplays' mod that seemed to have replaced lost contact with a monstro anm2, guess I could do the same with coin tears
Not if you try to override them
I've done a bunch of animations now and all you need to do is Play
i mean changing it at every frame
i just looked at the "customMob" mod and that's what they're doing
But the images change
So all the animations stay as they were
And load the png into the tear sprite
i think ill do bag of bones and sack of bones
You can create a custom spritesheet
If the tear is going to be the same every time
hmm
Another thing is
One thing you could do is set the frame every POST_RENDER
<@109102083218653184> I tried and couldn't figure it out; I hacked in my tear variant in MC_UPDATE
<@126590786945941504> i spawned a tear, then tried to change its sprite's animation to a bigger tear but it reverts on the next frame
TearFlags?
hm
Anybody knowledgable on what to do code-wise to set your tear variant after you've made your entities2.xml?
Need help with sprites?
What's your problem?
i give up on this for now
me neither man
<@229593818691928067> I dotn know what you want
or both?
Bag of Bones or Sack of Bones?
one of you ?
why don't you just set the sprite?
who's?
can i see your code ?
Oh so 1 frame is ok then?
well the tear animations are only 1 frame anyway
yup if entity:GetSprite():GetFrame == -final frame- then Stop() end
because readability is a Thing
just renamed it to anim
where frame is a variable for the animation name
same with my mimic anim
and it works without reverting
I run this code once: sprite:Play(frame, true)
with my player's tears
you have that line in your code
well that's inefficient but i might end up doing that
tear:SetSpriteFrame("RegularTear13", 1) this will set it to the first frame every time it runs, I imagen you dont want that?
yeah
wait I thought you wanted it to just be the big version of the tear
i think so <@150336707609231362>
nope haha
if its running the function every frame then its going to keep resetting the animation
try Stop() and then Play()
im gonna make a bag of bones
oh ok <@150336707609231362>
queueing up animations
is it like
also, they start on frame 1 not 0
i tried SetAnimation as well
on a different entity, i played an animation that had Loop=false and when it ended it kept playing it, i had to detect when it finished
you can try SetAnimation("")
<@229593818691928067> why do you call tearSprite:Stop() if you want it to keep going?
you have to detect when its at the end of the animation
well his issue is that it reverts to the old image
yes
<@229593818691928067>
its playign them instantly stopping
Where is main.lua?
```local tear = Isaac.Spawn(9, 0, 0, npc.Position, dirVector:Normalized()*12, npc)
tearSprite = tear:GetSprite()
tear:SetSpriteFrame("RegularTear13", 0)
tearSprite:Play("RegularTear13", true)
tearSprite:Stop()
-- works for one frame
```
recommend lookign at Angry Fly
thats all they do. but you have to program the A.I
They basicly spawn an entity
to see how they work
i need to download a mod that adds a familiar
so
what entity are you spawning
don't need big tears
screw you robo baby
still doesn't work, i give up for now
just making sure
if (item is my custom item) then (trigger my custom code) end
MC_USE_ITEM
do active items just do MC_USE_ITEM or whatveer instead of onuodate
and then setting the frame to RegularTear13, 1
you can try stopping the entities' animation playback
oh ok
I'm directly affecting player tears
<@116386733905412105> what entity are you spawning ?
idk
how old is it?
my computer lagged like crazy whenever i used missing hud 2
so glad found hud is a thing now
found*
wait no that's 2.0 for player tears
ohh, now I get it, foud hud is actually part of the game lol
now i want to make an item that explodes into bones and leaves creep behind
<@237683512944230401> it's an EntityEffect probably
what is that
with 9.4.0
tf are you talking about
how do you add creep?
i get the same problem with 9.4.0 though, player tears ?
I suspect enemy tears update per-frame
ah
enemy tears
9, 0, 0
or are they just the default player tears
is there anything unique about these tears
works for me
k testing one sec
does'nt work :/
instead of false
just do true
actually
do it in update
uh oh, something's gone horrible wrong. Now I'm just spawning flies on any hit, rather than when I have my item
uuh, i'm doing `tearSprite:Play("RegularTear13", false)` to change the tear size, but on the next frame it goes back to normal, how can i make it permanent ?
and I fixed playing nicely with tear variants
I fixed my chocolate milk interaction
probably
*WEAPON_ROCKET
is WEAPON_ROCKS epic fetus?
you might find more information in the enums
namely, the proper formatting for ProjectilesMode and ProjectilParams
I think Spawn is the best you're gonna get until there's more documentation on EntityNPC:FireProjectiles()
enemy
are you trying to fire a friendly or an enemy tear
uh
i mean in memory
hopefully the entity dies on its own though
well it'll work
as in you just spawn an entity, you don't actually fire
yeah, I feel that's still the hack-ish way to do it
lmao
would be neat if the API functions actually worked ?
of course with this i have no idea how to set Tear parameters
local tear = Isaac.Spawn(9, 0, 0, npc.Position, dirVector:Normalized()*10, npc)
how do you shoot tears?
ooh
maybe Finger! is a laser
i found how to shoot tears ?
ooh
what does tech x use?
not a different thing
azazel is made by using the max distance thing in brimstone
no
azazel maybe?
not sure what entity_laser is then, as technology also used entity_projectile
well, hit an enemy with it
Weird, but good to know
yeah, now brimstone spawns spiders when I use it
really?
Brimstone is ENTITY_PROJECTILE
Brimstone is Entity.Projectile
OOOH
can you use laser variants for changing weapon type to laser?
what do you want to do ?
anyone know how to change your weapon type?
hm
brimstone isn't spawning anything, but regular tears are
I am
try it out!
if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR or EntityType.ENTITY_LASER and
code should look like this right?
my profile picture shows how im feeling
There is
At least my profile picture shows how i'm feeling
is there a command to spawn a trinket?
Now I have no idea how to spawn the trinket
how to change this?
The .xml part was easy
Hm
Idk the guy mix spanish and english xD
like can you change youe weapon type to 7.7
anyone know how changing the weapontype works?
does anyone know how to shoot tears ? from an entity, not the player
trying to spawn in spiders if a player is hitting an enemy. Just have to make it work with knife and brimstone
Nah not trying to spawn it
you can spawn in pride lasers
there's a class EntityLaser
cool, thanks
laser!
entity laser ?
quick question, is brimstone ENTITY_LASER, or ENTITY_PROJECTILE?
why is that guy speaking english with an american accent, some nutjob that wen to latin america?
and ingame type the name until it shows you the id
in lua you can use GetItemIdByName
Oh
the id that you put was ignored
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilPmPar2SM4 jump to 6:58
oh
items.xml
and then it kinda led to civil war
so there were 4 emperors that were equal
But I made the sprite and Put it on the .xml
to make it easier to rule
into 4
its when they divided rome
if nothing shows up as suggestion while you type that then it probably doesn't exist
I don't even know what tetracy is it sounds gay
"epiliepsy of the devil"  well...
it crashes if you try to spawn something that doesn't exist!
why cant anyone appreciate the tetrachy
spawn 5.350.120 right?
But the game crashes
I use the dev console
its a picture of a map of the tetrarchy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOy2xaqbNQc
no
Aleeh, you could do it using the dev console!
Your new profile picture is just like a picture of a map
ill try to found it
But how do I spwan my trinket?
its related to modding 100%
yes
Sorry to bother
Yo
Is this related to modding
any clip with sub? my spanish is pretty bad
is this person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lid57CJRL4M
when they split rome into 4 parts to rule to make it easier
its a map of the tetrarchy
why do you have a map of southern europe?
how long will it take trump to start an international crisis
i am now the tetrarchy
Now the testing part!
test
Saved the .xml
and he calls the pokemon "pokimon"
and they give sin hearts
xD
i mean it supports evolution!
they are
and he says that they are satanic and stuff
Its about a  religious person speaking about pokemon
my bad
it a meme
nope jean
lmao
i feel like my biggest flaw in modding so far is I panic when I have to set up my own function
is pokemon "pokimon" in spanish ??
lmao
wat
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po0Sujc_nR4/maxresdefault.jpg
Actually easy to use .xml
im gonna make a sassins reed mod B)
Now I understand what's happening
thats what i was thinking
Just needed to open the xml file
you could track a custom stat just in your mod
son satanicos !
Oh thanks bois
thank you! ?
has anyone made custom stats?
I add .00001 to each tear's damage when I've adjusted it
ok how about
wooow that's cool <@218390040928059392>
and the few that do are just reskins of bosses
i hate how all the boss tags in the steam workshop dont actually add new bosses
hi <@237683512944230401>
I uploaded my mod, take a look
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837414680
to keep track of every tear fired by the player
I Think it would be too memory-intensive
there be jean
has an object to associate entities/properties
this mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836609390&insideModal=0&requirelogin=1
i've been keeping variables in my mod scope instead
probably not if they're userdata
haven't tried
yeah
you mean entity.whatever = true ?
is it possible to give entities a custom variable
I've got this playing well with chocolate milk now
sublime text is pretty nice
any text editor will do
depends which .xml files :p
<@!95444500364660736> no idea sorrey
Thanks
i use notepad ++
Sure
<@221628025463111680> there's some tutorials on http://reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac !
I just need to know wich program i use to open .xml files
if you are looking for a starting point go look up some tutorials, there are already several
Lol
somebody can probably help you <@221628025463111680> but you'll need to be more specific
can someone explain to you... everything about modding? in this channel?
Does anyone know possible values of `EntityPickup.State`?
Can someone explain me?
Iknow nothing about modding
Sup
Yo
that's what I've been sayin
there is no tears stat, everything is tear delay iirc
has anyone figured out EntityNPC:FireProjectiles ?
peace indeed.
peace ^^
hello ?
and then in main.lua you need to add a method for the cache mod callback
you need to add cache flags for the stats you want to affect
in items.xml
how do i add stats to my custom item?
like, a thematic addition
Idea for items, maybe you could make a set of items that are pages of bible verses, and does something relevant to them
^
tbh, bible verses wouldn't be too weird, this is isaac after all
no, input/output
bible verses?
5:12, 7:19, 10:25...
like hdd read/write I think
That's close enough
I mean we have tear delay
dunno, it's similar in dota 2, they just disabled some stuff though
good morning everyone
Use `--luadebug` or wussname if you want require
quite the security flaw
pls include require again
he tweeted modding fixes coming today
hopefully
maybe it will come today
I feel like modifying tears would be one of the most important part of the api, I'm bewildered as to why they don't have it
because my item turns all attack speed changes in to damage changes
It doesn't, no
hmmm
I need to predict the numerical effect of chocolate milk on maxtearsdelay.
Wait what do you need that for?
well the api doesn't expose any tears stat anyway
there's that
http://i.imgur.com/2q38k1o.png
yes, tear delay is in fact frames between shots
that I am positive of
Now... the stats in lua right?
tear delay is frames in between shots
well, that's what the wiki said
not what the antibirth people told me
opposite, I believe
tears stat is calculated off delay
and probably does something with the tear stat itself
that don't make no sense
I did, it says it multiplies delay by 0.8.
look it up on the wiki
Why you make me wear this mom
if delay is 5, it becomes 12
so pretty
if delay is 10, it becomes 25
Haha is big
if maxtearsdelay is 7 when chocolate milk is picked up, it becomes 19
Worked?
You're so pretty that your head turned into a red square
ok
make sure your png is 32-bit
lol icerzz



okay it's late here, thanks again so much for the help guys. Once I am done with my current mod pack look out for a chainsaw mod... That will probably not work lol. Or i'll be back here with more questions
hey guys
ok chocolate milk officially makes no sense
I agree
Don't get me wrong, making 3 items + a transformation and having them all synergise with eachother was so much fun, but some of those hours were wasted due to confusion from the docs (and also the fact that this is the first time I've used lua).
Might take a while, hopefully not
I'm sure that the API will be good when it's fixed
Yes
that would be good
But I'm mostly hopeful for the editing of tears
Bringing more people into the modding community is hard when they can't solve anything for themselves, which is sad because more modders could be a really nice thing
But yeah, better documentation is pretty vital
I feel like the community has figured out the most importiant stuff already
lol
I thought they abondoned the api already Kappa
i'll stick with antibirth api thanks
nice
there will be an update?
Hopefully good stuff
hopefully more doc comments lol
Modding and balancing stuff
Dunno
whats in the update?
Also, I'm kinda excited for todays update
for sure, i'm just saying, it would of been a nice addition. If i had to choose between a well documented API or the item creator, the API wins for sure
it took the community a while because the documentation is terrible and you *literally couldn't* at launch
the api wouldn't be less shit if there was an item creator
That's more related to functions the API should have
although you could half achieve this using other item's effects
well, that's more what I meant to say
They added it in an update
it didn't it just wasn'T possible before
It didn't take a while
that's true, but it took the community a while to even figure out how to change stats, and even then some stats don't change correctly
Isaac character editor for items isn't a good idea
all it would do is have more bad mods come out
Just a minor hassle if anything
^
Yeah, but that isn't really a problem when you know how to do it
It would speed up the proccess a lot, you could quickly get the stats and such out of the way ready for lua code
bad idea
item creator?
Some other things are more critical atm
Maybe, don't think that is too neccesary though
A library for the mods, so to say
Honestly, the modding tools should of came with an item tool creator for base stats and shit, with a lua window beside it.
It would however be nice to have a like common mod to add functionality, instead of everyone reinventing the wheel
send tyrone a nice tweet "add these in please okay thanks"
See which ones dissapear
I guess keep track of all the entities
Lots and lots of awful hacks ?
How would, you do that tho?
Yes indeed
that could be pretty useful
On item pickup, on consumable pickup, on pill use (current API only allows callbacks for modded pills, not for built-in), on trinket pickup  small stuff like that.
like what?
Would anyone be interested in having additional callbacks that aren't present in the current version of the API?
lol
They are made up of protons and electrons
they can all be the same colour?
hm
I get so frustrated with modding sometimes but its so fun too
what do chocolate, milk, and rocks all have in common
swiggle swaggle
or the trinket could buff the active, as well as give a small chance to do what you said before
so that they do their thing twice per use
the spacebar version should be able to upgrade machines
I could prob do a smaller trinket version too
yeah
like a grab bag
the trinket is consumed to repair it and you get an explosion of item drops
i mean it could be nice if you are sam and wanna ruin yourself on a blood bank
if a machine breaks while you're holding the trinket
yeah, its an active that has 6 room charge
it could be a nice trinket
Lol, I made an item that repairs a broken slot machine/blood bank/donation machine/fortune machine. Then I realised it's not actually that much of a cool idea lol.
Yeah, what's up with literally everyone having better ideas than I? lol
welp, someone is better at ideas than i am
Ludovico Technique: allows you to charge at any angle, not just cardinal direction.
if you wanna look into transformations, i made one a few days ago. Costumes are easier than they look
an active item i made, i wanted them to do the happy animation, i know how to only do that pretty much lol
Yeah, I need to look into costumes and animations too. But I'm enjoying myself with just writing the code for now
why are you animate happy-ing?
chainsaw + car battery = lawnmower
chainsaw + car battery = lawnmower
I need to figure out how to get animatons done in code properly rather than just player:AnimateHappy()
Nah, I don't think it'll be that bad. The synergy at least
Mom's Knife: chainsaw has knives on its chain and deals additional damage
it would take me a long ass time to get that done lol
I think it would be rad af
chainsaw at front and brim at the back
Indeed
that could be cool though lol
I guess it kinda will be then
Rocket boosted chainsaw
thats like mega isn't it?
Nice
Brimstone: shoots backwards while you're charging forward, giving you extra speed an damaging enemies behind you.
got a picture of a newd anime figurine holding a chocolate guitar
googled chocolate rocks for ideas
I was thinking of making a chainsaw that dashes you fowards until you hit an enemy (which explodes into half hearts) or a wall, idk what you could even synergise with that... lol
toph also gets a permanent curse of darkness
Make a complex item then ?
well my mods are not really in depth atm
Why not do it then?
do it to it
make*
I wanna made a mod and build synergies into it pretty badly ?
But it's tough to have test through everything
I imagine it's a fairly easy fix
think I'll have to come up with a synergy
since a loss in tears equates to a loss in damage
Neat
chocolate milk made her tears stat so low that my damage was only 0.5
oh thats pretty cool lol
more work, but, eh
her starting item makes it so all tears up instead gives her a damage up
You can always make it synergise specifically
Toph from avatar: last airbender as a playable character
What is your mod?
chocolate milk does NOT work with my mod at all
ok so
lua is pretty good
is the same as if condition then a = value else a = other_value end
its pretty fun, also seems fluid, I kinda like C# how its structured
I pretty much like all languages though, since all are pretty much higher-levelled than what I am used with hah
a = condition and value or other_value
lua is so pretty
I like lua though
nice, I mostly work on unity C# and lua can be a nightmare some times lol
I've even used lua at work ?
yeah
been makin games from scratch
So not as much experience
Yeah, this will be the first game I truly mod
>:)
I've been working with lua for a long time
good thing it's accepted, haha
me too...
old habits die hard I guess
I keep adding a semi-colon to my code randomly to line ends
Thanks so much Eat, that's cleared a lot up.
thx!
this
ingame is spawn 5.100.itemid
spawn 5.100.itemId
on pedestal
ingame
u want to spawn an item on the ground?
In-game or in-code?
I only know giveitem
I don't know <@132569939969179648>
...
that makes so much sense my god lmao
spawn 500.
ohhhh
how is the code to spawn items?
the player's stats are set back to the same values as when you started the game
each time the cache is evaluated
so for example, if i have this tie already, then pick up another item to re-evaluate the player's stats, it wont re add the ties stats onto the player?
because when the cache is re-evaluated, it takes the player's default values and just re-calculates everything
every time the function is called
you want it to do the exact same change
should you add a bool to each item so if this function is called again it wont readd the stats for each item the player has?
yeah i'm just doing flat numbers atm for stat changes
mine is a variable because it changes. it turns tears up in to damage up
and you're fine to use a number instead of a variable
yeah
except I stuck in some additional stuff for your specific use-case
i'll give that a shot and tell you what happens, thanks
that's my function for MC_CACHE mod callback
then: ```function tophmod:evaluate_earthbending_stats(entityPlayer, cacheFlag)
    local toph_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Earthbending")
    local other_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Other_Name")

    if entityPlayer:HasCollectible(toph_item) then
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
            entityPlayer.Damage = entityPlayer.Damage + toph_item_bonus_damage
        end
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_OTHER_STAT then
            -- update the other stat for toph_item
        end
    end

    if entityPlayer:HasCollectible(other_item) then
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
            entityPlayer.Damage = entityPlayer.Damage + toph_item_bonus_damage
        end
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_OTHER_STAT then
            -- update the other stat for toph_item
        end
    end
end```
when i give myself the item, nothing happens and no errors lol
xmls are all good, I made the tie upgrade its own function
well firstly you need to make sure the cacheflags bit in your items.xml includes all of the stats changed by each item for each item
uh
i'll try giving the callback the items, see what happens
one of 4 statements it runs, apparently it thinks 'dwightstie' is 'megsshoe'
that is an if statement for when they pick it up
if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SHOTSPEED and player:HasCollectible(dwightstie) then
                player.ShotSpeed = player.ShotSpeed + 0.1
            end
or missed an end somewhere and one is nested in the other
then you probably have your if statements mixed around
if they're doing each other's code
multiplier, that is
So I just set a variable and did it outside
i mean, the items work, they just do each other's code, which makes no sense as the IDS are set correctly
just the change doesn't stay
It gets called and everything
yeah
Maybe I did something wrong then
are you sure you're using MaxFireDelay?
firedelay works fine for me
which means every time the cache is evaluated, you need to make sure your custom items are adding their stats using the mod callback
So I had to work around that
One thing I found out about the evaluation thing, is that fire delay doesn't work currently
every time the stats need re-evaluating, it re-calculates everything that has been picked up that affects the stats currently
because I have two passive items currently using the same function, but with different ifs
you only need your own custom items in the callback
could I put multiple items in the callback?
you can manually call EvaluateItems() on the player
Check if the player has the item in the callback
Or, if that doesn't work
You might want to pass the item ID
"dbditems:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, dbditems.cache_stats)"
yes
unless i'm completely missing something, its all good
You're using the cache callback, right?
idk
you might be giving them the wrong directory ids
has anyone had this problem before? i remember someone had an issue with this but with active items
guy guys i got a quick question this code here is pretty simple, if they pick up an item called dwight's tie, give them stats, if they pick up megs shoes give them different stats. Super simple right? Wrong apparently, Dwight's Tie only gives 1 of the 4 stat ups and megs shoes gives all of the Dwight's ties stats up.
like how burning basement has that fiery effect or womb has one
And by overlays you mean...?
can overlays be added? i guess they can if antibirth had its own special ones
yeh x'D i'll update the mod soon
char

just Mondayin ur Garfield
but its like 2/10 of the people
part of the brazil community
rly bad
"Hue" its a bad
Oh no...
hue
Brazil
where are you from?
meh
your english seems fine to me
and
i dont know what to say
my english sucks haha
Hey kube, srry
ok
or reextract the resources
validate your files
weird man
guppys collar png
dont have
yep what?
yep
...?
to 448
Just item 353
It works fine
http://i.imgur.com/t89VVup.png
Yep
From the game
It's in the resources folder
Its not
search for it lol
"costumes\costume_212\_guppyscollar...."
*ahem*
Where is the png kek
Or open the original
Copy the png
I told you
this
because
Why not use guppy's collar?
like guppys collar
tbh, I don't know that much how modding was done before ab+
For a neck item
Someone have an anm2 template?
doesn't MH inject into the exe?
You don't need to mod the executable necessarily
And I'm pretty sure that modding an executable on mac is gonna be incredibly difficult
good point
No robobaby, shut up
So I doubt Satch means AB+
Found HUD is built into AB+
I mean
I assume you can get all kinds of stats with the api
Kube, it might be possible to do without exe modding now though
will do.  going to just hang out here and i'll drop some questions if i get stuck.  i am fairly new to this but i am a relatively bright guy I think so I'll try and figure out as much as i can by myself
<@161784350155735041> Not many people can give you advice on exe modding probably, especially with AB+ out, but feel free to ask questions either here or in <#220581404612886528>
Robobaby! That's not how you welcome new people! Bad bot!
i am wondering if anyone can give me some starting tips for where to go to start
hi everyone i am new here and i have been reading modding of isaac and I am currently planning on porting missing hud 2 over to mac
its in the original file
hey
ok
If you moved the anm2, then you've got to move the png too if you want to see the original item correctly
to add the png
Did you move the file?
i have
oooh
?
thx!
resources\gfx\characters
sorry caps lock
OK ONE SEC
yep
did you unpack your resources?
where is the items anm's?
The animator layout is fine when you understand it
for moving
it could be much worse
I think it's fine
this animator layout sucks
uuugh
they have the item names in them
look at the other anm2 costumes
you need an anm2
an animation
of that item
archive
i need a anm2
for applying the costume
but
I dont know lua scripting
what
<@132569939969179648> see above
see ya
nvm gotta go now
that get applied on item pickup or something
items.xml also has costume ids
and then you have to register your costume in costumes2.xml
I am only going to be here for like 5 min
Hallo
I think there's an EntityPlayer:AddCostume(id) or something like that
those are costumes
on isaacs body
The item appear
Like
What do you mean?
Someone knows how to make items animations?
why did they release it this quick
wish they took like alot more time and made it much better
It's usable, but needs more stuff and proper documentation
This API is all sorts of fucked up
<@195368190333812736> good night :)
seems like you might want to get an ide, as the documentation says https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/md__i_1_doxygen_test_input_converted_test__debugging.html
<@166200750349746176> Anyways Im going to bed Ill look into it more tomorrow
It looks the same as other active items
Yeah idk why it wont work
<@195368190333812736> We'll go here i guess
But not your mod folder
So it works if you put it in the game folder
The relative path is broken
Well it seems to run it, but it just says no file found
You have to run the game with `--luadebug` or something to have require
Or rather
Yep
I think they disabled `require` because of security issues
`local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)` also, not `Isaac.getPlayer(0)`
It's just broken?
So I remember you guys were talking about this earlier but what was the conclusion on "require"?
Also its `GetItemIdByName` not `GetItemIDByName`
Robo-Baby ?
Ah
```
local mod = RegisterMod("Enough Black Hearts", 1)
```
Ah, right
You're missing the version in your RegisterMod
What's the error in log.txt?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Enough Black Hearts")
local blackheart = Isaac.GetItemIDByName("Black Heart")
function mod:update()
  local player = Isaac.getPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART,HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK,pos,Vector(math.random(0,10),math.random(0,10)),player)
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.update)
```
Show code
It still doesn't work.
*didn't
Oh.
You don't close the Vector
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Enough Black Hearts")
local blackheart = Isaac.GetItemIDByName("Black Heart")
function mod:update()
  local player = Isaac.getPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART,HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK,pos,Vector(math.random(0,10),math.random(0,10),player)
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,mod.update)
```
Yep, but what's wrong with this?
So yeah I explain most of it up there^
hah
Fix your mod
Is there any way to stop the game from inserting update.it?
What currently broken synergies would you guys like to see fixed?
hm?
So I have a question?
oh
<@240743817530179584> what are the great child's stats
It's basically just if you grabbed two lards mixed with black bean
i think it just might be an hp up and a speed down?
The Great Child - you'd have to explain it more, but not sure how to do it, might just be stats and costumes, in which case it's doable but I don't know how to do it
The Broken Heart - I haven't done any familars, no clue how to do them, really
The Juggernaut should be an easy callback, but not sure about it
it'd be great if you could help us with programming some of the items
Arcanum is one that I have no idea how to implement properly
I see
3 or 4
I think I'd know how to make all but 3 of them
I like how tame the items are
Yeah
Are you talking about the adversary's attack's effect?
"earth shatter"?
Each item is based on a ghost
13 Ghosts is this movie of this guy grabbing a bunch of ghosts and forming a eye to hell
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZNESmrLPug20Oert_oTsOQpZUdsHK1xh3D8wtVlFEM Here's a rough out line
As in, what're the actual items and stuff
I don't even know what 13 Ghosts is.
<@240743817530179584> What's the mod gonna be about?
We just need a programmer
New mod https://redd.it/5mww4y
A mod based on 13 Ghosts we have most of the item art and the item effects
With what?
<@!182509747835109387> yo wanna help me and pea?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("TNT Tears",1)
local tnttears = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("TNT Tears")
function mod:update(dmg_target, dmg_amount, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local spawnChance = math.random()
    if spawnChance < 0.05 then
      if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and dmg_source == 0 and player:HasCollectible(tnttears) then
      Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_MOVABLE_TNT,0,0,dmg_target.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
    end
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.update)
```
I made a mod that sometimes spawns a movable TNT barrel where you shoot.
Tables ar efun
lol
Ugh, I hate tables.
what i did for my item is to store a table of which stat bonuses i've earned and then to apply the worth of the stat multiplied by the amount of times i earned that bonus in the cache evaluation
So how can it be fixed?
evaluation works by resetting all the stats to base and then checking them again, so one time you use the item with the movespeed boost it gets a + and then the next time you use it with shotspeed and movespeed gets a - while shot speed gets a +
But why does it give stat downs sometimes even when it's not returning to the previous value?
not too much, but it will take more
Oh, that will take a lot of code.
if you want it to be permanent you need to keep track of each stat bonus you get and apply them all every evaluation
what you're doing in the code is setting stat to 0-5 and then re-evaluating the player's stats. since stat is a single variable it'll re-evaluate and stat will no longer be 0, for example, and instead be 4, causing speed to go down and shotspeed to go up
Also, why does it do stat downs sometimes?
Why not?
if you were hoping that those stat upgrades would be permanent they won't be in the current design
Oh, thanks.
just missing some ands in there
```lua
if stat == 0 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED ~= 0 then
    player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 0.2
  elseif stat == 1 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_RANGE ~= 0 then
    player.TearHeight = player.TearHeight + 0.1
  elseif stat == 2 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY ~= 0 then
    player.FireDelay = player.FireDelay - 1
  elseif stat == 3 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE ~= 0 then
    player.Damage = player.Damage + 0.5
  elseif stat == 4 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_SHOTSPEED ~= 0 then 
    player.ShotSpeed= player.ShotSpeed + 0.1
  elseif stat == 5 and flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_LUCK ~= 0 then 
    player.Luck = player.Luck + 1
  end
```
No.
does your code spawn your items?
What did you do to fix it?
Yes.
spawns a random pil, 1 key, 1 bomb, changes 1 stat?
is this what it's supposed to do? https://files.catbox.moe/wp7hyu.mp4
so i went and implemented your item pissy
It still doesn't work.
Okay, thanks.
For the `MC_USE_ITEM` callback you should have `mod.redBook` instead of just `redBook`
What is wrong with my code?
Temporarily replacing the sprite sheet?
The spritesheet has it laid over though
How terrifying.
Managed to replace spritesheet
That's not just laid over
http://i.imgur.com/YF64UNY.png
I figured out how to replace sprites
guys
Is anything wrong with my code?
As programming nerds, we're above honesty offending us.
But hey, ain't http://i.imgur.com/WyktW0T.png rude? <3
accurate
second of all
rude
first of all
As in you can get the item but using it doesn't do anything? Are you viewing the log.txt?
Should I readd cache = "all" to the items.xml?
Doesn't seem to do anything off-hand. Kinda funny to find it in there, though.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);

It still doesn't work.
Tempted to touch one and see for myself.
I know *that*.
It makes mods unplayable.
Is it still runnable?
¯\_(?)_/¯
What effect does that even have on the game?
<@186331772412231681> I'm going to get it just as soon as I get a paysafe
The update.it is in the game files
dirty pirate
The update.it won't allow the update to load?
wait whats that?
Ha.
GOOD FUCKING JOB TYRONE
i dont think its an error that is underlind
I was used to Eclipse.
AHHAHAHAH http://i.imgur.com/q8wSksh.png
That makes it a lot easier.
Oh, Zerobrane underlines errors.
would i have to get that effect the same why i got the tear that causes this end point
I think
After spawning the explosion effect, set the effect.Sprite.Color
You're supposed to put player
It's not literally EntityPlayer:
oh wait what
how would i apply that modifier?
What's the error?
<@168775690152443925>  just a regular explosion with a green Color modifier
Help me please. I am so close.

does anyone know which effect type is sloths tear explosion?

It still doesn't work.
That is an int
yeah it is, but you don't need to type that, you can type `CacheFlag.CACHE_ALL`
is not an int
0xFFFFFFFF
```CacheFlag = {
        CACHE_DAMAGE = 1,
        CACHE_FIREDELAY = 2,
        CACHE_SHOTSPEED = 4,
        CACHE_RANGE = 8,
        CACHE_SPEED = 16,
        CACHE_TEARFLAG = 32,
        CACHE_TEARCOLOR = 64,
        CACHE_FLYING = 128,
        CACHE_WEAPON = 256,
        CACHE_FAMILIARS = 512,
        CACHE_LUCK = 1024,
        CACHE_ALL = 0xFFFFFFFF
}```
I checked enums.
The enum for the all flag is the integer
It accepts an integer, so what integer is the all flag?
The all flag
No
So 6?
all
How many flags? 1?
EntityPlayer:EvaluateItems
EntityPlayer:AddCacheFlags
That's because you don't add the flags and evaluate the cache inside useRedBook
But before I added the stat ups, it worked.
Or do the stat ups
I'm not getting any error in the log, but my item won't spawn anything.
And what's your error?

What's your exact code?
There is no evaluateCache
But then I get an error
***DON'T PUT ANYTHING***
No, that doesn't work.
So just put 0?
It's EntityPlayer.
it's always an int but sometimes it's an entity number, sometimes it's an item number, and sometimes it's unused
So what's your item supposed to be doing? Use it, and it adds random stats? If it's not a one-time use thing, wouldn't he need to track each stat increase in the cache?
check the enums part of the docs for what the third argument does
No it doesn't
the third argument of AddCallback has a different purpose for every different ModCallbacks value
It takes 3 parameters.
...?
But it still needs an entity.
EVALUATE_CACHE
not USE_ITEM
no
wait
Otherwise looks good
Don't include redBook
I think I'm learning.
Is this good?
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,onCache,redBook)
No, I'm not spawning the same pill/card.
And find out yourself, because there won't always be somebody to tell you everything
Then you open `index.html` in your browser
Then `LuaDocs`
You go into `tools`
Well, first, you have to open your isaac folder
Also, I think you might be spawning the same pill/card every time, I'd have to check
How do I do that?
You don't have onCache added as a callback and you don't run evaluatecache inside useRedBook
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);
mod.redBook = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("The Red Book")
local stat = 0
function mod:useRedBook()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  local pillOrCard = math.random()
  stat = math.floor(math.random()*6)
  player:TakeDamage(2,0,EntityRef(player),1)
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_KEY, KeySubType.KEY_NORMAL,pos,Vector(0,2),player)

    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_TAROTCARD,0,pos,Vector(-2,0),player)

```
I'll send my code.
Also, it doesn't work now.
Even if it did, that would mean it'd have an extremely tiny chance to be 5.
Most of the time 1 is not included
[0, 1)
It's a standard thing across languages and RNGs
Nope
Does random not include the top value?
Yes.
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Also, you gave me math.floor(math.random()*6), but since there are 6 stats, should it just be 5 because it rounds down?
If you're keeping the same code, you don't really need to compare if `randStat > #.##`
Nope
Do I need to change 0 for different stats?
flag&CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED ~=0
But I cba to write it properly now
In fact, you should write the entire thing more cleanly
But you need to change the `stat`
There's no number in the snippet you sent
erm
But a different number?
Well, I know you need to change RANGE to DAMAGE and so on.
Yes
Also, do I need to change flag&CacheFlag.CACHE_RANGE to a different value for different stats?
It's used for passive items
Yes
The one in items.xml?
Also remove the `cache` flag from your active item, it's probably ignored
Okay, thanks.
in onCache `if stat==0 and flag&CacheFlag.CACHE_RANGE~=0 then --changerange-- end`
In onUse `stat = math.floor(math.random()*6)`
On the top of your code: `local stat = 0`
Basically, something like
And set the precalculated stat from onUse
And after onUse run EvaluateItems with every flag set
But inside the onUse
Don't randomize it inside onCache
You need to cache what stat you've changed
Then it gets more complicated
Yes.
Is your item an active item?
...wha-
Do I need to call onCache() inside useRedBook()?
Yes.
Do you have the `cache="all"` in your items.xml and did you reload the mod (not `luamod`) after adding it?
trial and error?
How do I fix it?
its probably not causing any errors then you just might not have wrote the code right
There's nothing else in there.
that just mean you used your custom collectable
Non standard collectible used 511
[INFO]
Check what happens
Get it to trigger a few times
Log the flag when it's ran
How?
You need to check how is the callback ran exactly
It can change multiple stats or none at all
So if it's ran multiple times
You generate a new random number every time it's evaluated
Well, there is a problem
Yes.
You want to change a different stat every time it's evaluated?
It didn't work.
Also, just to be sure
If you checked for what way is the flag passed and that's how it is, yes
```lua
function onCache(_mod, player, flag)
  local randStat = math.random()
  if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat <= 0.16 then
    player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 0.2
  elseif flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_RANGE and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat > 0.16 and randStat <= 0.33 then
    player.TearHeight = player.TearHeight + 0.1
  elseif flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat > 0.33 and randStat <= 0.5 then
    player.FireDelay = player.FireDelay - 1
  elseif flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat > 0.5 and randStat <= 0.67 then
    player.Damage = player.Damage + 0.5
  elseif flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SHOTSPEED and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat > 0.67 and randStat <= 0.83 then
    player.ShotSpeed= player.ShotSpeed + 0.1
  elseif flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_LUCK and player:HasCollectible(redBook) and randStat > 0.83 and randStat <= 1 then
    player.Luck = player.Luck + 1
  end
end
```
So this should work?
EXPLOSSION
***TYRONE*** http://i.imgur.com/yXK3HMi.png
i ultimately removed the 1-14 though
There's also a misplaced comment for Acceleration http://i.imgur.com/5cxiwri.png
also the 1-14 was me testing a way to specify multiple points without using putting each one individually
"Affects range"
Range isn't just one stat in-game
Those stats **are** range
http://i.imgur.com/YD6q4B6.png
That's because
But there is a CACHE_RANGE
So there's no direct way of changing the range stat?
ShotSpeed is relevant here too
TearHeight, TearFallingSpeed, TearFallingAcceleration
What are they?
For range
There's 3 stats you can change
Yes.
do you mean how far something shoots
Is there currently any way to change range?
Not sure what were you thinking there
Also, `1-14` is `-13`
It's worse than writing ```lua
for i=1, 4 do
    local gridpos = Room:GetRandomPosition()
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, 40, 3, gridpos, Vector(0, 0), nil)
end```
four times
```
local gridpos = room:GetRandomPosition(1-14)
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, 40, 3, gridpos, Vector(0, 0), nil)
```
Is there currently any way to change range?
it's better then writing
I didn't even know lua had `repeat until`
```
repeat
        looptrig = looptrig + 1
        local gridpos = room:GetRandomPosition(1-14)
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, 40, 3, gridpos, Vector(0, 0), nil)
      until(looptrig >= 4)
```
Anywho, I'll be busy for a while. I'll be back later to spread misinformation and poor programming practices.
Shouldn't it choose a random int every time I use the item?
thats what i did for one of my rngs even before i started learning lua
I don't get it.
But look at it now
But I asked **WastelandOasis** to learn Lua instead of modding
Yeah, that's the problem with seeds. You might want to try RNG():Next after running the command.
I'm sorry for what I'm about to say
*sigh*
use a loop?
So I either spawn all cards or all pills
RNG():RandomInt doesn't keep choosing a random int though.
My suggestion would be just trying to code stuff
Trying to re-create Binding of Isaac in another engine really makes you realize how big of a pain in the ass seeding is.
Also, if you're having trouble with PiL, don't worry about what I said and try other websites
Lua uses 1-indexing for arrays, that's all
That's in no way related
dude
no lua doesnt use 0 in those situations from what i read in PiL
Try it
¯\_(?)_/¯
If I do RNG:RandomInt(1), it includes both 0 and 1, right?
If you want a range with a float, just do `RandomFloat()*(max-min)+min`
no
Just read the docs guys
RandomFloat doesn't seem to accept parameters. If you want to specify a range, you'd probably want to go with RandomInt.
<@112975821186031616> RandomFloat() the () contains the range right?
The seed by itself can't be all-inclusive.
They seed things based on the run seed :P
Or uh, RandomFloat in your case.
RNG():RandomInt, for example, would probably be what you want to use. That being said I have no idea how they seed things.
Okay.
Check the docs for `RNG`
Take the second argument from the method and use it to generate a random number that you use to decide
probably
RNG?
So what do I do?
And there isn't a single class for enums, those are just global tables
Yes, the `RNG`
```lua
MC_USE_ITEM = 3,            -- Callback is a method that takes (CollectibleType, RNG). Return true to show the "use item" animation, otherwise false. Called when a custom active item is used, after discharging it. When adding callback, specify a CollectibleType to only respond to one custom active. The item RNG allows for the item's random events to be seeded. ```
is there anything that takes the place of math.random() though i thought all the current random classes were for specific enums and such
You should use RNG.
And it doesn't help in that case
`math.randomseed` seeds `math.random`
*sigh*
There's a class dedicated to RNG, I think.
I guess I'll use math.randomseed if it's better.
But every active item has a separate RNG AFAIK
There is `math.randomseed`, but it's global, so even if, it would be problematic with other mods
I don't believe math.random is seeded. It's a basic lua function.
I just want to get it working first.
I'll test out if it's seeded.
If your script is spawning something, you probably should seed it.
There is a reason for the RNG to be seeded
Practically, would you put up a clock that never changes on a web application?
Technically, who the hell uses a clock built into a web application?
?
I mean, *nobody's going to care that every time they log into their account they see the exact same timestamp, right?*
*eh*
Alright. Thanks for the info.
Nobody's going to care that when they spawned a card with an active item, it was a different card.
Yes
Hm, it defaults to 0-1, then?
<@112975821186031616> No, not really, you can decide exactly with `math.random() > 0.9532` already
Unless I'm stupid and it's actually seeded
You should probably add a parameter to that math.random so you can specify the chance of it happening better, don't you think?
I don't care.
So every time you run the game with the same seed, you might get different results
What does that mean?
Yes, but it's not seeded
math.random() worked when I was spawning a card or a pill.
If it only runs once and passes the whole mask, then it's easy, just change it then
See what the function passes when `cache = "all"`
Well, experiment
Yeah, that's how it works
Then what should I do?
Though not sure what's the correct way
So cache = "all" allows you to change all stats?
Also, you shouldn't use `math.random()`, it's not seeded by the game
If it does, you should do `cache = "all"` and only change it once
That is, if it passes the complete bitwise number with all flags
okay i just have to say this now i dont think PiL is first edition is beginning coder friendly, it trys to skip over a lot with the assumption that you knew past languages
That's an interesting one, I'm not sure how does exactly the callback work
So if I have a variable that is randStat = math.random(), and I only want one stat to be increased, can I do 
```lua
if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE and ply:HasCollectible(itemStatTester) and randStat < 0.16 then
```
I was sure I've seen mods that changed existing items' stat modifiers
i dont think so, the only thing we could do is sprite animations and xml changes
yeah, checked now, nvm that then
Like you couldn't do stat ups when the game first came out.
Sure, an easy API for plain damage up might be useful, but isn't there a way to do that rebirth-style already?
Because Nicalis always does something wrong.
And if you don't know anything about reading or coding, why are you complaining about Nicalis?
neither am i but i understand that
But I'd think everyone can read
it does say it needs EVALUTE_CACHE
Yeah, but not everyone is genius coder.
```lua
    -- Callback is a method that takes (EntityPlayer, CacheFlag). 
    -- Called one or more times when a player's stats must be re-evaluated, such as after picking up an item, using certain pills, manually calling EvaluateItems on EntityPlayer. 
    -- Use this to let custom items change the player's stats, familiars, flying, weapons, etc.
    -- Items tell the game which stats they affect using cache values in items.xml. Then the callback should respond to the CacheFlag by setting the corresponding player stat.
    -- Other items' stat modifiers, multipliers, etc are applied before this callback is called.
    MC_EVALUATE_CACHE = 8,```
Look at enums.lua
IT IS DOCUMENTED
At least document it better
Before you decide to shit on Nicalis for making it in a proper and sturdy way
Tell me a better way to implement it that is completely foolproof
Dude
UGHH NICALIS
Yes, it's a separate callback, what were you thinking? :D
So I need a separate function just for stat ups?
And you have to add `cache="damage"` in your passive item in items.xml
And you might have to do `not (flag & CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE == 0)`, though I haven't tested extensively
You can remove the `ply = `blahblah in the latest version
```lua
local function onCache(_mod, ply, flag)
    ply = Isaac.GetPlayer(ply.Index)
    if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE and ply:HasCollectible(itemStatTester) then
        ply.Damage = ply.Damage + 1
    end
end```
I deleted most of it, didn't make a proper mod with it because I prefer messing around, but
hm
Not sure if I have the code, lemme see
If you pick up an item that gives you damage, the game sets damage to base and runs through every item that does damage and applies it
Can you just give me an example of how to do a stat up?
And I mean it, that's why EVALUATE_CACHE exists
Player.damage = Player.damage + 1
2. The game resets stats and recalculates them on certain occasions
1. Lua has no +=
No, that's not the problem
because the api is shit right now
It's so stupid. Why can't you just do Player.damage += 1?
Can you give me an example of how to do a stat up?
While it's running, that is
<@168775690152443925> Try running it from cmd and typing in 10 lines
You just run it in an EVALUATE_CACHE callback and change the stats when the player has the item and the right flag is passed
but when running this code i get no print so i dont really understand whats going on
Insanely?
Why is adding a stat insanely complicated?
```
-- read 10 lines storing them in a table
    a = {}
    for i=1,10 do
      a[i] = io.read()
    end

-- print the lines
    for i,line in ipairs(a) do
      print(line)
    end
```
\`\`\`lua
god damn i forgot how to post code
and '-- print the lines
    for i,line in ipairs(a) do
      print(line)
    end'
"-- read 10 lines storing them in a table
    a = {}
    for i=1,10 do
      a[i] = io.read()
    end"
PiL gives me these two codes to understand it
Do you mean ```lua
for k, v in pairs(t) do
    print(k..": "..v)
end```?
do mind putting that into a way that prints v
The only reasons to use ipairs **I know** are either when you have more than just the array in your table or when you need to iterate over them in the right order
Because pairs iterates over everything, not just array or hashmap part individually
The more useful function is `pairs`
And `for k, v in ipairs(array) do` is equivalent to ```lua
for k = 1, #array do
    local v = array[k]```
Though do note, that arrays and hashmaps are contained within the same type and you can use both in one table
And `n` is returned by `#array`
So that if you did `for i=1, n do print(array[n]) end` it would never print `nil`
But an array is the part where you have n elements with keys from 1 to n
How it works is not the important thing here
Make a mod for ? but it makes ***Spoils*** Jacob and Esau into mario and luigi
The array and hash map parts
Lua tables are split into two parts internally
Basically
<@126590786945941504> can you please explain this to me; excerpt from PiL  "The basic Lua library provides ipairs, a handy function that allows you to iterate over the elements of an array, following the convention that the array ends at its first nil element."
You can sorta do mouse control in AB+ using EntityPlayer::GetAimDirection()
Y'know, OOP, advanced messing with pointers, some of the shit that seems magically impossible without a scripting language
I should one day learn some proper C++
maybe
It's probably C++ coding with Kil's hacks.
Kilburn has been teaching limt.
gj then
hmm in a way
Is it exe modding or what?
blue baby with red hearts lol
it's not ab+
Was there an API update or something?
You're shitting me, right?
Wait what
it's not antibirth
That's Antibirth though
<@145740433165647873> Post your code.
huh
Bad Gas is random
Balls of Steel is Health Up
They are just flat out wrong.
...?
The enumerations for all the pills are off.
https://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-editor-keyboard-shortcuts
I don't think there is a shortcut
I guess I'll do it the old-fashioned way.
Because that's how it works in every other IDE.
I tried that.
try ctrl+/
What's the shortcut for commenting a block of code in Zerobrane?
Maybe this isnt how youre supposed to do it ?
Oh, thats problematic
90 times
Yes, it's the charge up sound effect.
Is there a sound effect? I didnt notice
Is there any way to get it to not play that sound effect?
Also, I realized pills weren't spawning because I put "post" instead of "pos".
Instead of `local redBook = blah`, do `mod.redBook = blah`
Oh yeah, it isn't in the function.
Oh.
Its local to the global scope ?
No, it's local.
redBook is already global
Do I need to make redBook global?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);
local redBook = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("The Red Book")
function mod:useRedBook()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  local pillOrCard = math.random()
  player:TakeDamage(2,0,EntityRef(player),1)
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_KEY, KeySubType.KEY_NORMAL,pos,Vector(0,2),player)
  Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_BOMB,BombSubType.BOMB_NORMAL,pos,Vector(2,0),player)
  if pillOrCard < 0.5 then
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_TAROTCARD,Card.CARD_NULL,pos,Vector(-2,0),player)
  end
  if pillOrCard >= 0.5 then
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_PILL,PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_NULL,post,Vector(-2,0),player)
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,mod.useRedBook,redBook)
function mod:update()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(mod.redBook) and player:NeedsCharge() then
        player:SetActiveCharge(player:GetActiveCharge() + 1)
    end
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mod.update)
```
Here is my code.
<@267156751936126977> It doesn't work for me.
maybe you want cooldown, bud
like mom's pad
breath of life has "cooldown"
hmm well
ah 70, the magic number
It's the same except it has 70 charge.
no
Boomerang is probably the same.
look at it in xml
told you to check boomerang man
But it does charge, it just doesnt show until its full
Im trying to see if I can fix that
Yeah
The charge bar doesn't show up?
Replace `mod.COLLECTIBLE_TEST_ITEM` with whatever variable you assigned your item to
But it mostly works
For some reason it doesnt render the charge bar though
```
function mod:update()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(mod.COLLECTIBLE_TEST_ITEM) and player:NeedsCharge() then
        player:SetActiveCharge(player:GetActiveCharge() + 1)
    end
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mod.update)
```
Give me 1 sec, Ill come up with an example
No, sorry
Sorry, I don't know what the heck AddCallback does.
Like this?
```lua
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE,player:GetActiveCharge(), player:SetActiveCharge())
```
Using player:GetActiveCharge() and player:SetActiveCharge()
How do I do that?
tbh Ive never done this myself, Im mostly guessing ?
Add a handler for MC_POST_UPDATE, increase the charge by 1 every time the callback fires
How do I code it in?
Yeah, but for all other items it's the charges.
You need to code in that bit yourself
Like if you create your own item with 90 charges it wont recharge over time
or something
that's the frames
And every frame or so that you have the item for it increases the charge by one, making it recharge over time rather than per room
Yeah, but why the number 90? Just make it -1 or something.
90 is so that it shows up as a continuous bar instead of divided into parts
boomerang
check uhh
NICALIS PLEASE
WHY 90
lol I didn't think you only meant the item declaration
xml for Butter Bean
Oh, I know how to find out how to do a timed charge.
and I don't use that word lightly
shit's a farce, dawg
98% man
lol half
I should also ask them where half the documentation is.
Anyone know how to get the current Level?
truly amateur stuff
what shame
they got their enums wrong
Ha
You think they'll respond to an email?
Because random gives you a tarot card that does nothing, and null gives you a random tarot card.
send nicalis an email
Random and null should be switched around.
It won't show its face.
it's shy
Got it.
Oh, I can set different vectors.
wait whats wrong with the tarot card?
<@122924009527574530> How do I spawn the consumables around Isaac but not where Isaac is?
weird
Oh, you have to do type null.
just throwing ideas out there, people
it's gay maybe?
<@122924009527574530> Why does my tarot card appear like that?
if only there were some documentation
Took long enough to find
Oh, there is Card.CARD_RANDOM
Yeah, but I need another parameter because it takes in a subtype.
when an enemy has a variant it will say there
Or TarotCardVariant
But there is no CardVariant
enums.lua
I don't know what the heck Variant is because there's no documentation.
?
that switches cards?
is it variant
How?
there is
no clue
Is there seriously no way to just spawn a random card?
a donut
if not ab+ and not antibirth, then what I wonder
i call black magic
hmmm good question....
Then how did you make that item?
that's true
<@145740433165647873> But you said you don't know anything about the AB+ API.
or a wiki
like google docs type thing
no, finn
maybe we as a community should make one
yeah maybe once it has docs it will be a little better
Oh, that is with the Antibirth API?
only thing it needs
^
just needs proper doc
Its pretty good
seems pretty shit to me
I don't know the first thing about ab+ modding
ty baws
let me open my code
?
Because there is no tarot card subtype
<@150336707609231362> how would I get all gridentities then...
no clue
Timed charge or spawning tarot cards
robo baby thinks I shouldn't
with what, pal?
<@145740433165647873> HELP ME
no
does it pass it down if I do this?
how do I get all the gridents??
No. check if its poop using gridEnt:ToPoop() ~=nil
then spawn dip
if yes
then I check its state
fuk so first i check if the Type == POOP
you have to use the MC_POST_UPDATE
i have cartoons to watch, busy man
?
os.time(), save it, check in update when it's larger than some number
No, grid ents are not an NPC
<@150336707609231362> I cant do MC_NPC_UPDATE right?
dunno
<@122924009527574530> How do you make an item with a timed charged?
make sure you check if state equls nil. if it does and you try to get the state then the mod will stop
I think it's state
ah yeah, nice question
Yes, that's why I want to know the answer.
I'm not sure but I think poop has a hidden variable which shows its damage(startign at 4 adn -1 every time it gets hit)
hmmm good question
<@145740433165647873> How do you make an item with a timed charged?
to check like state?
I need to find a way
so
poop
GridEntities cannot take damage
"I can't get <insert thing here> to work." should be our motto
this does not work

How do you make an item with a timed charged?
what do you need to know?
wehn poop takes lethal damage
how can I do it
I know how to use gridentities so I'll help ya
the normal one is when ever you have that one thing that turns enemies to poop
can't get the gridentity to work
and justa normal one
a grid entity
fire is an entity
there are 2 poops
dunno, have fun
which isn't a gridentity?
but i know that fire is a roomentity
fuk me.
i dont think so
poop
poop
like poop
Can GridEntities take damage?
I love it
welcome to isaac modding ?
It expect you to know the difference, I guess
it's messed up
double :: is namespace
yes it does
With "::"
Well, the documentation has all the functions written the same way.
heheheheh
not an instance function
Oh.
static function
its Isaac.Spawn
its not Isaac:Spawn
i see your error
Yeah, that's what I did.
Vector(0, 0)
And what do I put for vector?
But why do I need position and a vector?
then why ask
well, its both
Yeah, I know that.
a vector is a position
describes motion in a direction
Do you know what vectors do?
I don't see the code errors in log.txt.
log.txt will have code errors
It hurts me, but it doesn't spawn the key.
under My Games/Afterbirth+
No, I can generate the item.
check the mod directory, it might ahve generated an update.it
check log.txt
o
It still doesn't work.
congrats
This is my new code.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);
local redBook = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("The Red Book")
function mod:useRedBook()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position,0)
  player:TakeDamage(2,0,EntityRef(player),1)
  Isaac:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_KEY, KeySubType.KEY_NORMAL,pos,Vector(0,0),player)
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,mod.useRedBook,redBook)
```
i know /s
sarcasm /s
./s
i was typing when you were
copy cat /s
hehe
just one
just one Vector
dont do Vector:Vector
Oh wait, I don't have pos defined.
I don't know what the heck vector does.
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);
local redBook = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("The Red Book")
function mod:useRedBook()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  player:TakeDamage(2,0,EntityRef(player),1)
  Isaac:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_KEY, KeySubType.KEY_NORMAL,pos,Vector:Vector(0,0),player)
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,mod.useRedBook,redBook)
```
What is wrong with my code?
yup
Say thanks to the discord and sub reddit. Spread it out so people who need help may b able to find it
just courtesy
should
I don't remember though.
you can comment to thank whoever you got it from
It will take a while to learn the API. lucky you have people thoguh. I learned all the stuff by testing
I know Lua, but this API is shit.
Is that okay?
All I've been doing is copying snippets from other people.
I think, I may have messed that up
Isaac.GetPlayer().Position
steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834433846
well, update to my mod, starting to shape up quite well, though I feel I'm missing so many things in the API.
There's no documentation for spawning.
How do I get the position of Isaac?
so have a random chance to spawn one
they nhave the subType closed and opened
detect when a chest is opend
Also, I know how to give Isaac consumables, but is there any way to spawn consumables?
ah yes of course
Except I have to change 1 to 2 for a full red heart.
Yep, it works.
I hope it does anyway because I am going to bed now :P
but just see if it works first I guess
or actually, you probably want to change the last 1 to something longer, I think that one is the time isaac spends invincible after getting hit
Okay, thanks.
mine is:
`entities[ i ]:TakeDamage(player.Damage, 0, EntityRef(player), 1)`
so yours should work if you do:
`player:TakeDamage(1, 0, EntityRef(player), 1)`
What did you do for your code?
I'm damaging enemies not the player but it should work the same
wait I just realised, that I use TakeDamage in my mod, and I could have just cross referenced that for you...
Player:TakeDamage(1) doesn't work
what makes up 50% of programming errors :P
a lot of this stuff is easy to miss
Sorry, I'm tired. I should probably go to bed.
Oh, oops.
the game thinks it is a passive item
should be active, not passive :P
<passive cache="all" description="Small present from China"
in your xml
oh wait
I want to modify when loot is dropped from enemies
ActionTriggers, anyone know how to use them
Is there anything I have to do to make it an active item besides the charges?
It says it gives me the item, but it doesn't show up.
the rest looks about right
Okay, I'll try it again.
it might just be that it wasn't giving it to you because it had an error in it but I'm not sure
```xml
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive cache="all" description="Small present from China" maxcharges="0" gfx="Collectibles_TheRedBook.png" name = "The Red Book"/>
</items>
```
Yes.
did you set up the xml?
Also, when I give Isaac the item, it doesn't give him it.
Oh shit.
it's case sensitive
you declared player but then are calling Player
no
<@154701703474577408> Is this code correct?
```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("The Red Book", 1);
local redBook = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("The Red Book")
function mod:useRedBook()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  Player:TakeDamage(1)
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM,mod.useRedBook,redBook)
```
I have no clue.
wait is resources/scripts/main.lua even your file?
i'd have thought main.lua would just be in the root folder of your mod, or does it copy them to that directory during gameplay?
My mod only has 8 lines of code right now.
Nothing
what's at main.lua:35 then
Debugging suspended at 'resources/scripts/main.lua:35' (couldn't activate the file).
my hunch was correct then
I used 90000
fyi to make isaac not able to shoot. player:SetShootingCooldown(somehugenumber)
try just Player:TakeDamage(1) and see if it complains
otherwise just enter a random int for flags and then see what happens
Also, what are flags? One of the parameters for Entity::TakeDamage() is flags.
Just editing textures
Haven't messed around with api
Idk
So there is no way to do it right now?
And likes to play by its own rules
But you know api is cancer
under DamageFlag
If would be just Deal.Damage (1, PLAYER_HEALTH)
there's an enumeration called DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS, but I don't know exactly what to do with it
Well in gmod aspects for lua
How do you make an active that does 1 heart of red heart damage to Isaac?
isn't there, like, an EntityType thing to check?
But I assume the api is too dumb to be able to do that
And we can just retrieve files at anytime using loadresource and just the path
I code with gmod in lua
alright
Idk
what function receives a texture?
So **if** player is char **then** get texture
The no-attack thing, and also presumably
Well that's probably a blindfold thing
How do you make an active that does 1 heart of red heart damage to Isaac?
<@214205689021595648> Use if function to specify which pickup texture is used when Player is a certain char
can you make it so isaac can't attack?
how would i tell the game to always replace heart pickups with something else when playing as a certain character?
for now i'll assume they just didn't do the sounds like they didn't do the itempools i suppose
thanks for the suggestion trust melon
lmao
but maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised that something works as intended?
based on past experiences no, haha
no matter what you put fo dmaage
because burns and poison just use your damage
good question
think itll actually let you pick damage instead of using your damage?
And that's how we do it there I never used the api lua wise
awesome
I just code lua in Garry's mod so I was just taking a guess at it
TakeDamage should be as simple as calling it
is the TakeDamage thing hard to use?
with an ogg and a wav inside resources/sfx/sound.*** and an entry in content/sounds.xml i can't get it to play using EntityNPC:PlaySound(id)
works, thank you <@135254843567767552>
works, thank you <@135254843567767552>
Stick to where the others are though
And it will find it
Specify the path
Or lua script you made
Name the .ogg whatever it is in the mod
and for new sounds?
And place the same name of the .ogg found in the original game files into the mod folders you made
And place the same name of the .ogg found in the original game files into the mod folders you made
Do resources/sfx/whatever_the_path_is
Make a folder in your Afterbirth+ mods folder named whatever
Make a .ogg of a sound file you want to change
i also can't seem to get custom sounds working. that's a shame
thanks
yea seems so
so you have to keep applying whatever value you want to apply
my assumption with how evaluateitems works is that when it's called the characters stats are rolled back to their base values, then it loops through all the items and lets them adjust the stats how they please until the call is complete, so if you tell it to increase by 1 one time and never again, it'll be damage + 1 until the next thing calls evaluateitems and then back down to damage
ough
i just stores bonuses in an array for the different stats
ok
my item does something similar based on how many kills you've earned and it doesn't reset
no, probably have to
are you keeping tracking of how much damage you've earned locally in your mod?
grr
and it does, once, and then reverts back to the original damage
I want to increase damage for every room
hmm seems to only apply once
thought the flags were permanent
trying
ok
ahh you do add flag and then eval
checking
thank you
https://hastebin.com/atoxakasaf.lua
me?
what section of the code?
I'll look around to see if there is a way to just make an element
anyone have a mod or example code that uses EvaluateItems ?
so in the anm2
okay
i'm not sure if they disappear after going a certain distance out of bounds though
so the bitbox is inbounds but the sprite is out
off set the actual sprite
spectral tear entities can clip through walls
anyone know how to let an entity clip?
tried both update and pupdate
added that addcacheflags line, no worky
i did not experience that being the case
yea that's what I thought
If you add `cache="damage luck"` to your item definition in items.xml it will automatically evaluate for you without needing to call the function (replace damage/luck with whatever stats)
thought those flags were implied from the weapon
ok ty
problem: trying to make a ui element using a custom entity, but I can't spawn it outside the room borders.
I've got it working for me
firedelay does work assumingly as intended
Also note that firedelay and maxfiredelay don't work yet
saying it worked for you dosent help anyone
e.g. `player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE)`
indeed
works just fine
You have to use player:AddCacheFlags(...) first
no errors in log.txt
currently calling it and not getting any callbacks in the cache callback
It re-evaluates stats
what does it do?
anyone get EvaluateItems to work?
oh nice
the repeat command just repeats the last command entered, whatever it was
oh in that case maybe
grid spawn is random
well since it will spawn everything in the same place, probably not
does that workd with grid spawns as well?
any time
Oh okay, thanks
`repeat 10`
type the spawn then
Well, I meant in the console
use a for loop or repeat statement?
Also, is there a way to spawn a whole bunch of enemies into a room at once instead of doing it line by line?
fraps
How do you do your screen captures anyway, ShareX or something?
thx
?
how
sure go ahead
may I ask how?
That is a sweet sword
Hey,. thats a sweet swrod working
check it out I got this sweet sword working
not sure if this was the goal, but loading an entity and replacing its animation? also did it with spawned tears https://files.catbox.moe/7p5af8.mp4
I can get vanilla sounds playing just fine, but custom sounds dont work at all
Has anyone got custom sounds working?
<@267156751936126977> Oh, that did the trick. Thanks
My first mod was changing the necronomicon into the Bee Movie
<@130188705498529792> The Velocity parameter to Isaac.Spawn needs to be a vector (e.g. Vector(0, 0) instead of just 0)
that is pretty funny
so it should be okay
that and i stole code from another guy, but i never made the mod public
my first afterbirth+ mod was changing the display image of mom's bra to a picture of Rias Gremory from Highschool DxD in lingerie
fun fact
lmao, I made an item that distributes damage dealt to enemies to all enemies in the room (divided by total number of enemies). Turns out that any boss that spawns enemies and then kills them(i.e. widow) ends up killing itself
Man, I swear I didn't change anything between now and before, but is anything wrong with this part of the code? http://i.imgur.com/UpoSZT3.png
SNAPPY DED
no oh
oh no
rip snappy
snappy ded
snappy mod have stack overflow
Yep, just up and doesn't work anymore
Oh great, I think my mod stopped working
Hey I wonder why the snappy mod was removed?
Another way to do it is to do something like `int foo[REALLY_BIG_NUMBER]` in C iirc
which calls your callback again, which evaluates your cache again, which calls your function again...
You're evaluating your cache inside of a cache evaluation callback function
basically too much memory used
But in this instance it is
doesn't actually have to be function calls though
its when a function calls itself or other functions too many times
It's 4am and I have to get up soon. What am I doing. Help
whats stack overflow again< damn my memory
aaaaannd we have a stack overflow ``` [Snappy Expansion] Error in PostEvaluateItems call: C stack overflow```
havent watch todays one yet
i need to watch your item video
changes stats
the Devil card
same with cards
wait you dont know me
hey lyte!
Implicitly
evaluateitems is probably called after use pill since they tend to change stats yeah
It doesn't need it in certain callbacks like MC_USE_PILL, but yeah a lot of times you need EvaluateItems()
where is a good place to start learning modding?
would be nice if the docummentation mentioned that xd
thanks
oh
add cache flags just prepares you to call player:EvaluateItems()
i have ```  if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
    Isaac.DebugString("reeval")
    player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE)
  end``` it prints the line but doesn't do the re-evaluation
I mean CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE is equivalent to an int value
mostly everything is a table
(IEEE 754 float)
yeah, lua is weakly typed
yeah I'm looking it up and that's what it is telling me
then you're doing something incorrectly
Im pretty sure lua doesnt even have a specific integer type, just number
well it isnt re-evaluating my damage stat
it works fine
but generally speaking that isn't true
maybe in lua you also can't have a negative integer
does ```player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE)``` simply not work?
integer means no fractions, not no negatives
which is an interger which means positive only
there is an intensity option
or can oyu even set the amount?
what if you darken with a negative value
also its easier to use darken than create a new graphic
yeah
like seeing stars when you're hit
Or rather, different audio
believe it or not flashbangs make your vision go black for a moment
I'm just wondering because of an idea I have
like your affected by it a little
Is there a way to play audio when shooting a tear?
the screen *darkens* from the flashbang?
<@!267112861921181697> PM your idea so I can keep track of it
aka the screen darkens for a moment and all enemies around the tear get confused
but you can rotate it with the attacks buttons and its direction doesn't change if you move
I want to make a tear affect that any tear Isaac shoots has a rare chance to be a flashbang
but you can't shoot it
behaves like moms knife
Speaking of which, when's the mod that turns the game into The Slamming of Barkley?
can someone help me with making an item that
<@!267112861921181697>  I can try
okay
in theory
but it would be funny
i know that's impossible
in reality that's pretty stupid
and to kill enemies, you had to get the basketball tears into their hoops
LMAO
so i want to make an item that spawns a horse man horse that is friendly and flies around leaving a trail og bones
yo what if there was an item that put Basketball hoops on every enemy's head, and your tears were arced basketballs
<@150336707609231362> can you help me make a tear modifier please this one is simpler than yesterday
lmao i was screwing around with the console earlier and you can make things constantly explode
Isaac.GetDunkedOn()
anyone?
Isaac.Kill()
Is there a good tutorial on costumes actually?
and kill you again
i'll revive you
?
anyone?
bye
bye
aye
dont worry ill kill my self first
aye ?
petition to ban ender

disablePuff
how do you disable the puff when you spawn an entity?!?!
im freestyling
anyways
ah
sorry
mine
Destroy all fires
kinesis are you talking about my boss about it or
there could be like torch enemies or something
to kill it
Wonder if it's possible to make a hallway boss, though I'd imagine a lot of frustration with that
and complete submerge it in darkness
maybe the catch with this boss is you have to get rid of the room light
I wish I was smart enough to make a boss
and reflect it
and block your brimstone with said shield
i want to make a boss that can reflect your tears with a shield
pls
this is what im referring to
http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Hanged_Man
Binding of Souls
I want to make a boss called Ultra Thing
I want to make a boss but I am way to retarded to do so
50 men from jojo
there's like
what guy from jojo
The Hanged Man
When will we get Binding of Lothric - souls crossover
i got the inspiration from that one guy's stand from Jojo
Mirror man
i'm pretty sure it was a joke
would just require lots of sprites, but I could probably do it
Mirror Master
<@155169558121021440> You really cant do that, theres already a Flash villain who does exactly that
<@138456585218293760> integer underflow
<@155169558121021440> sounds cool
... brb im gonna trademark this
Mirror Master?
also that sounds great kinesis
So
can my penis become a number
and then jump between mirrors
delirium does what he pleases
nonsense, anything can be a number if you only believe it hard enough
delirium is a god
as in every now and then it would disappear
ITS DELIRIUM OKEY?
delirium becomes a valid number
roughly 1.7x goldenman
delirium must equal to something
what if there was a boss that you could only damage if it was hiding in a mirror
but that is not a valid number.
delirium
delirium
what number is delirium
h a r d
on a scale of 1 to Delirium
its most;ly animation thats the problam
about 3.5 hard
like Brimstone and Doctor Feturs
how hard is it to make a boss?
maybe Ill just make it a rare item
?
i wish i was a boolean
not a boolean
SHowMap(False) maybe
just bullshiting though
HideMap
if I used ShowMap, how would I turn it off?
calm down friend
ok
NO
Roundabirth
The Binding Of JoJo
YES
Crypt of Isaac: Dancer+
yes
how about, when you die you see "To be continued" and the music plays
they would bounce off walls/objects
and yeah
Not as effective for regular enemeis, maybe; but for bosses, really effective
oh its fine just wondering if you want to make it sometime
And you know those are gonna be inevitable
like bouncing and shit
even better, they're not thrown, they roll around before exploding
Honestly, I'm just waiting on the inevitable Jojo mods
Yeah im amking stuff for Ender for now sorry maybe later
before exploding
they deal contact damage to enemies
when they are thrown
There should be a trinket called "Gray Matter" that reveals the entire map
Bowling Bombs are fired based on your current velocity
ur mum xD
Bowling Bombs
ender don't try to monopolise other people, bob can speak for himself :v
actually yknow what would be a cool item
kk
just if he wants another sprite to make
he doesnt have to do it right away
bobs doing stuff for me rn
i mean
32x32
and 32/32
like this with an S on it
dont want to keep this chat too off topic
While we're at it, may as well make him look like the Pilot from Gungeon
anyway im gonna go back to work
bob want to make a sprite?
a rubber band gun
or even worse
what if it's a finger gun
<@237735158369746945> Yeah im here
but how to make that a mod
"boi he aint messing around"
so sassins reed was basically a joke off of assasins creed where you had to fight the Emplar Ights who spy on stuff with goguardian
Gun: 1 tear delay and 50 damage
gives you hair that covers one eye
Cosume: Edge
it gives you angry eyebrows and also isaac is holding the gun by the barrel and pointing the stock at enemies
is already a really dark combo
Depression + Transcendance
"gun: Isaac's fucking pissed"
let's just wrap things up now
oooookay
and make isaac throw a gun
thatsfuckedup
ohno
lmao
...what if you make the gun an instant reset
reskin the boomerang as a gun
what if the bullet could bounce off walls and hit isaac if he doesnt dodge
haha
lol yeah
isaac comically misusing a gun would be a pretty good item
ngl I'm surprised that nobody has suggested "new item: gun" until this point
they get confused
but when monsters see him fire tears instead of bullets
and he cant shoot it
what if it gives isaac a gun
robobaby is triggered
i said bang
like an occasionally "flashbang"
i dont actually know what itll be though
How about a tear modifier that when it hits the ground confuses all monsters surrounding it
Isaacreed
Im gonna make a mod of that
ok

Biggest limmitation
which is a pretty big limitation
there's a lot of things you can do right now tbh, but, what you can't do is put anything you make into an item pool
or stat changes
we can. Its just harder
or texture mods
except maybe make a few tear modifiers
i feel like that might be the best course of action considering how we can't do much with the current tools
aw
Hes spriting for me
It might be. Next week they are goin gto be sendign out more updates so maybe
fuck me
<@!188945290923868161> you there?
welp the idea is already taken
oh
would it be an okay idea to just wait until later to start programming, when there's much more room to work with
kk
just vid
no sound
cant listen
I am deaf
https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/C1q2To2WgAEP4iQ.mp4
wait for them to update api
I am too dumb for this shit
how am I supposed to make a tear modifier that splits into like 20 smaller tears?\
Also dont piss on the electric fence!
most importantly, never give up!
i need to think of how a sassins reed mod would even work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE
^
break it down to smaller tasks
try doing it
i dont
I have so many creative ideas but I know I cant do it myself and people normally dont feel like helping me
enemies near the door
no one knows what sassins reed is do they
how the fuck does the hiding of isaac mod work. i just walk in a room for half a second and everything sees me
The binding of parkor
the hiding of isaac
so
im gonna make a sassins reed mod
thats irrelevsant!
why not use a random code generator
my largest item is only 25 lines
THERE WE GO
YES
im gonna use a random word genera SASSINS REED
mine has^^
you know what
no, it does a bunch of shit
ha
it has quicktime events ?
mine too
which item
my one item has over 100...
<@150336707609231362> how many items do you have :D?
fml
no fuck this mod idea
!items
haha
only 350 lines?
wot
Neat
You have found **3** item(s).
!items
god damn it robo baby
savage robobaby
haha
fuck
mutation.
ok
many more coming obv
I have 114 lines of code
<:plum:259939492008296448>
yay
yes.. and then you have 350 lines of code in one file
awesome
that's what I am doing
yes
it is possible to make multiple items in one mod correct?
ok
hm
A paper that has what an item does, how it looks, how it synergies, etc
write down the details of your mod
design document?
protip, make a design document
a health down
im thinking
hm
ill make an item that mutates the player
alright I'll be back later
ok
so they at least at some point fit the condition HasMortalDamage() and not IsDead()
fireplace entities spawn coins with the code i used
hopefully there will be a collision callback in the future
np
what 3 symbols?
Thanks for the help though either way, it's much appreciated
I was totally relying on that callback to make this mod, trying to figure out how to work out collision in a non-hackish way hurts my head ?
just add those 3 symbols like the astrology items
radiation*
you could also theme it around alpha beta gamma radiatoin
the player or enemies?
literally radioactive
hm
literal elements
might want to check for collisions flotilla
ye
Like literal elements or the effects they have?
me <@121460786655657985> ?
<@150336707609231362> Fuck, I was worried that'd be the issue
preferably ones that I could just recolor midas touch to use
cause them to mutate
<@70946604139425792> I dont think the fireplace entity takes damage, just updates its sprite
but whatever for now. what other radioactive elements could I use?
well when i get better ill add more unique features
ugh
hey training is always good
im such an idiot
its almost the exact same
fml
....
not exact but close
neat. sigh sigh sigh
Dead Tooth <@237683512944230401>
<@120355885615808512>  which item?
animatino editor works fine for me
https://hastebin.com/otirezarug.lua This mod should spawn a red candle flame any time a tear hits a fireplace, but nothing spawns when I try it out ingame. The debugger doesn't spit out any errors at me, so I'm not sure where I messed up. I'm a novice at lua, so please forgive me if it's an obvious mistake
<@121460786655657985> does StartDebug() not work?
i swear to god did i really just subconsciously copy an item
animation editor not work at all for anyone else? attempt to open files and no interfaces update, nothing shows up?
which one?
the new item?
uranium bar sound like one of the new items
the logic for plutonium bar is cold fusion is cold ?
yeah, I started working on multiplayer, but kinda hard to do without sockets
ok guys. I have Uranium Bar(poisons close enemies), Plutonium Bar(% to slow near enemies, % to freeze close enemies). What other radioactive bars could i make
Alright, one sec
would be nice if require was enabled
<@70946604139425792> I'll have a look
Would anyone mind taking a look at a short bit of script to see the things I've messed up on?
Its a follower <:isaac_tongue:245063314906808320>
is require() still disabled?
<@131576903722074112> aww
anyone have an item idea for me to try out
Man, I've been trying to glean off of workshop mods on how to do something right, but I've really hit a standstill
https://gfycat.com/CreamyPortlyAustraliankestrel I don't even know what I'm doing
only 4 pages away!
Ill PM you ideas of what they should look like
my item is on the 4th page of the steam workshop XD
Thanks bob!
to apper in isaac
Essence of greed? Have a soulish thing, the middle is gold and is sourounded by grey smoke
<@237735158369746945> happy too
Hey, i dont know if its thing of this channel, but someone knows how to do items animations?
Whoa thats a lot of items i could help while <@112975821186031616> gives my idae a shot
<@!188945290923868161>  if i figure out how to add velocity you should sprite a sticky cannon ?
or at least help imo
if you would do that it would be great, I honestly have no idea what to do
<@!188945290923868161> I need to sprite a Slingshot, Essence of Greed. Blood = Power, Insanity, and Puzzle cube
just call me epic
we're gonna make boi great again
i gotta tell ya
What items are you amiking <@267112861921181697> ?
its gonna be fantastic, just big league, super duper
NO IM DIRTY BOB
i'm bob, you're bob, he's bob, are they any other bobs i should know about?
and duke of flies reskins of every boss
every room is gonna have bloat and portals
binding of autism
anyone know how adding velocity works?
Thsi is so confusing so many Bob's
uBet
the binding of enragement child
fnafb isaac mod
ha
I can do some spriting I guess?
its gonna be great, just fantastic I swear it
Wrong Bob, <@150336707609231362>.
does adding velocity make the enemy like shoot forward?
<@150336707609231362> yes
Oh okay, that works. Thanks
my fault :P
but i am gonna make a maplestory/fnaf/isaac LIVES mod
no problem
<@!194259969359478784> it works! thank you
<@242432019395510273> you do sprites?
and try working on a different project
I'm not your guy, pal
i kind of want to ignore the code i was just working on
Im happy to help when I can
I don't have any Sprite, guy.
well
?
i wanna sprite guy
bob
whos the sprite guy
And I've liked your sprites, for what it's worth.
I mean hey, if you just want to be a 'sprite guy' and make sprites for other people's mods, that's totally fine. Hell, I suck at spriting but am capable of some modding here and there.
well thanks but im just trollin
Time to make sprites for the items I made today!
Thats fine its nice enough your even trying
rugrats is perfect for this game
its gonna be great
im makin a rugrats/undertale mashup mod
I'll give it a try. No promises it's within my abilities or I'll be able to have the motivation for it.
I dont want people todo too much for me
`if entity:HasMortalDamage() and not entity:IsDead() then`
But just the mind contrrol would be fine
o yea endershot? thats sexcellent
Heres the full thing
I'll ask Lo-fi about that. I was thinking about expandign it to more then just makign mimic chests do that <@116386733905412105>
Basically it's a one use item and it charms a random enemy in the room permanently and they get an increase on there health and damage and they stay with you between rooms and floors
I was thinking about it just being a steak and making it half as effective but if used in an empty room with fires would upgrade into the grilled steak and different fire could add different effects
Umm ye
What do you want from your steak mod, <@!188945290923868161>? Still that mind control thing?
Hmm, well it seems like HasMortalDamage is closer to what I want at the moment, though it's still spawning in two things each time an enemy dies
change ```Lua

            player:RemoveCollectible(kingdomKeyID.KKCHAIN)```

to ```Lua

            player:AddCollectible(kingdomKeyID.KKCHAIN,0,true)```
<@166249905772429312>
I think its decent
I am making a mod\
any sweet mods comin out der
I think you should make the teeth a little bigger
mimics are my fav
starting
OH
it's not working
<@146345870114160640> Did the sprite work, look good?
someone help pls
everything below the first function is the stuff that leads up to starting with a custom item
https://hastebin.com/zeduketeji.lua
am i the only one that doesnt understand the hiding of isaac at all?
while isdead is occuring after the death animation?
works now
is occuring during the death animation
Whew
it looks like the hasmortaldamage
Wait, so is the "IsDead" functionally similar or is it for something else entirely?
to see if someone can help with the starting with custom item
okay i'm gonna reupload what i have now
glad it works now though :D
Sorry about that
yeah I know
just to show an image on the screen
70% of it
i had to edit like
still doesn't do what its supposed to tho
well uh jacob
how do you give a null entity a custom sprite
the other thing people are trying to figure out right now is sprites or something?
should be the first thing you're doing
<@166249905772429312> You got my code working? Great!
?
"Nil value "Isac""
I checked the log
I want to kill myslef
are you sure your use_item mod callback is firing?
why is my code fucking up tho
why cant i just sprite
why is spriting hard
Well the sprite thing is probably a mismatch of the image names and your items XML or something to that effect?
The sprite thing probably has nothing to do with the lua. Probably.
it does nothing
I can get the item, just the item has no sprite and it doesn't do what its supposed to
but I didn't see any differences
I thought it was a comparison
oh ok
to prove that's what it's used for
it's explained in the post, just making something happen when something HasMortalDamage but hasn't Died yet
ill try coding again latet
im fucking done
Alright.
<@135254843567767552> what am I looking at in this mp4
# means the length of the table
it was is the code I copied
Is that `#` supposed to be there?
if there's an update.it delete it, if it comes back check the logs
```function MyMod:use_slingshot( )
    local     player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local     entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsFlying() == true then
            entities[ i ]:Kill()
        end
    end
end``` this is making my mod old pls help
what do you guys think would be a good way to present some solutions to common problems, just upload some mods to the workshop?
now i just need someone to help me that can code
my brain is so dead
yay
help
Good job, you have some dirty text.
There are cooked versions
NO TEARS
LOOK MOM
Also <#267353315073982465>
oh god dude, x and y was just an example
That does not look cooked at all, Bob.

WOOHOO
works
it
it works now
what
`x` is the X coordinate where you want the text to be rendered on screen. `y` is the Y coordinate.
oh my god i'm retarded
lets see if i can make this work
thank you
x and y have to  be defined
im so sorry eatme i just cant think straight
Yes, that is better.
ALRIGHT DOES IT LOOK FINE NOW
<@237683512944230401> ```local toph_current_stage = nil

Is it dropping two of them at once, because I'm having that problem at the moment?
I can't make it any easier for you than this:

and just have it be "Mommy is proud!"
i think you should replace the "of you"
in your render text function
needs to be inside the left parenthesis
i dont speak english kek
Okay, *now* he has to be fucking with us.
shock, if blah not null
fuck you robobaby
<@166249905772429312> your first quotation mark
thx man
<@132569939969179648> Just saying, change "are" to "is" for grammatically correctness
how can we make a new entity with a custom costume?
if the floor is initlizaedbfsbfbf
did it like this
checked the log, it didn't happen
i need to become a spriter all my sprites ar just recolors of items
what do you mean, shock?///
What do you mean, initialized? Mod loaded? New run?
so proud
is it initlialized
to be like
what do i type

but

```
function VectorToDirection(vek)
    if vek.X == 0 and vek.Y == 0 then
        return 0
    elseif math.abs(vek.X) >  math.abs(vek.Y) then
        if vek.X > 0 then
            return Direction.RIGHT+1
        else
            return Direction.LEFT+1
        end
    elseif math.abs(vek.Y) >  math.abs(vek.X) then
        if vek.Y > 0 then
            return Direction.DOWN+1
        else
            return Direction.UP+1
        end
    end
end
```
<@121460786655657985> that's what you need
<@112975821186031616> I will admit to being one of those people (although I have used Python a bunch. but I've only been using lua about a week now
im going to do if blah blah blah(seeing if its initilized)
same sunx
<@121460786655657985> ye the key input part is hard and shit ?
so
i started lua today
ok
so if what the variable THINKS is the current stage doesn't match the ACTUAL current stage, trigger whatever code you want and set the variable to the actual current stage
Except it's now dropping two coins at once
I wish, hex. But there are way too many people here that are inexperienced with programming that are trying to dive straight into modding.
Okay well it actually does work now for some reason
is that it?
he's definitely fucking with us
alrihgt
lol, sunx
Remove that parenthesis before Isaac.

```         if toph_current_stage ~= level:GetStage() then
            toph_current_stage = level:GetStage()
            level:AddCurse(LevelCurse.CURSE_OF_DARKNESS, false)
        end```
shock, use an if
now, in your update function
<@116386733905412105> , I've got this "function Everything:onUpdate(player)" (in which Everything is the mod name atm) is this the one?
No, keep the one before the string.
current_stage = nil
at the start of your mod, make a local variable
yea?
?

shock
iv been doing this all weekend and my brain is fried
how the heck should i make it so a code triggers if the floor is intilialized
but
im sorry
Still, might've done that wrong since I ain't exactly a Lua veteran
only 100 bucks Kappa
<@120355885615808512> do you mind sharing the key input part of your code? probably gonna need it
<@193389830690963457> the hacked-in tear variant? that's in update
I tried that "HasMortalDamage" thing too but I don't think it did anything in particular
function("text_argument", number, number, etc.)
<@116386733905412105> for that code is that inside a funtion
i'll see if i can trigger stuff when things die now since i just solved my problems
well, he had one at the end as well
inside the function's parentheses
I thought you were joking ?
you need the rest of the arguments to the function
yeah but like, it's too soon
It shouldn't be there.
the parenthesis are there
the one after the MEMES" on the first line
Yes. After the string in RenderText.
I'm currently trying to do something like that for an item just to see what's possible, but I can't figure out how to get enemies to do something like that when they die
<@112975821186031616> I did not notice any parenthesis
uhhh
also alz what
i'll do that once i fix the thing
there's definitely an update or two between death and removal
Also the parenthesis. Did no one else notice the parenthesis? Fix that stuff.
<@166249905772429312> move all your callbacks to the bottom of your document, it's cleaner
theres got to be a high demand for a DK64 mod
ilise, I'm guessing it might be the engine, declare them dead and wait for the engine to clear them up on the next tick
What if you wanted an enemy to drop something when they die, like a coin or whatever?
it's possible those answers are good, i haven't messed with animations at all yet though
my DK64 mod is going to be lit
like turning into a banana that heals you XD
when you want something to happen right before they die?
<@135254843567767552> death animations maybe?
but i can't figure out where that's useful
I think hasmortaldamage is for some weird point in time when they are in a health state where they're about to be declared dead
if your log.txt doesn't have the message then your blindUpdate is never being called
<@166249905772429312> You terminate the parenthesis around your string.
eatme the function didn't work
Thanks though
ignore the comments.
Is HasMortalDamage a Boolean that checks if the enemy has low health?
i have 19, 41,  and 41 unique subs
```        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then

                --if entities[i]:CollidesWithGrid()
                    -- do something
                --[[else]]if entities[i].Variant ~= 33 then
                    entities[i].Variant = 33
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
                    local frame = "RegularTear" .. math.min(math.max(math.floor(entities[i].CollisionDamage), 1), 13)
                    sprite:Play(frame, true)
                end
            end
        end```
how so
kinda CalebG, like any stat change you can to use the MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback and set TearFlags
I had to hack in my own custom tear variant
damn
ah
and from what I can tell they're not accessible right now; I tried
thanks
<@193389830690963457> that's tear variants
:c
message isn't appearing
but yea nice catch I guess EatMe
the function isn't firing
and if your message never appears
so check your log.txt
alright
Combo Breaker is good for messing around ?
is there any way to access tear types, such as giving a trinket wide shot?
the debug thing is printing to log.txt

yea but messing around with them can be fun
nothing prints
nope
so item mods just aren't in demand imho
well they don't appear in item pools
how does the mc_player_init work?
passive
What item should i make?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323&searchtext=op
ah
<@120355885615808512> what is your mod
refresh your file browser
i did
it's really a shame.. I have updated all the sprites of my mod and added 3 new items... and noone subscribed since then.. but it's goood trust me FeelsBadMan
after update.it has been deleted
but there is no update.it this time
if you're trying to use fire delay to stop tears you should be changing `Player.FireDelay` in `MC_EVALUATE_CACHE` after calling `player:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_FIREDELAY)`
restart the game
i've had this issue before
it's not there
in your mod's folder
delete the update.it
<@166249905772429312> delete update.it
um
the max charge code
and if that changes, I trigger my code that I want to trigger and change my stored variable
sorry
the transitor code just doesn't do anything
and just have a stored variable for what it thinks the current stage is
I check in update
ok
uh
im basically trying to see if the level changed
mc_player_init or whatever occurs BEFORE the level is initialized
well
lol
you have to make sure the level has been initialized
<name> is expected near (
<@237683512944230401> what are you trying to do again?
<@166249905772429312> that too,  they were never the same after your birth
hm
it's the other way around, hex
but the function doesn't like those characters in the string apparently
i thought you said i messed up my parents
about memes
he was trying to make a joke
you still messed up your parens lol
eh
because im stupid
it might not play nicely
take out the parentheses
lmao
testing this now
what
<@237735158369746945> <@237683512944230401> why are there two of you
alright
EatMeReturns I used that and that line still errors with the error

[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:33: <name> expected near '('
remove line 7 <@166249905772429312>
ok
oh

so according to the doc, it will but not yet
CollectibleType     GetActiveItem ()
     TODO: Replace those calls with new class/structure that contains all item information.
if you want to render text on screen instead you can just do Isaac.RenderText("Hello world!"), x, y, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)  (guessing the last ones are related to width/height)
that's probably not max charges
mmmm wait
that's easy
neat
oh
player:SetActiveCharge(integer)
otherwise it looks ok
uh, think you lost some () somewhere though
like ``player:GetActiveItem()``
like this?
Limiting to 1 tear on screen using FireDelay <http://i.imgur.com/nc31Yi1.gifv>
is it possible to change max charges of an active item with main.lua?
sorry Game():GetLevel():GetStage()
wait so rendering sprites? anyone figured that out?
so for example, if you put it in your blindUpdate function you can see if the blindupdate function is firing
well im messing around with stuff
wherever you want to print text to the log to see if things are happening
but you got something else before, didn't you?
eat where do i put the function?
current_stage = Game():Level():GetStage()
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:33: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetStage')
it is
shock, the problem isn't there anymore, is it
so i must be using it wrong
I use it to check if a new stage is started
yes, get stage works
but yeah, it's a function
has anyone been able to use the level:getstage?
it's in the Isaac namespace
mom's knife and vampirism for one room
I like the moms cookbook idea
eatme that's a function right
Has anyone successfully transformed world coordinates to screen coordinate in big rooms?
wth
hm
does lua pass by reference? or would Isaac.GetPlayer(0) return a clone
with Isaac.DebugString("your text here")
hm...
you can also print to the log.txt file
like on screen
printing??
sunx, try printing something to see if it fires properly
maybe for someone who really doesn't like failing
can someone see why
<@116386733905412105> honestly, I have no idea
which doesn't work
tear not firing thing
this is all that relates to the

still not working
then why would it show me needing a function argument suddenly?
why is that a video
butt lol
showing the buttons
Shock, my money is that you have some other problem
thx <@109624258317033472> that's what I'll need to render sprites for
<@!194259969359478784> something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9UVErfnR1w
i dont get why all of a sudden i need a function argument
so
nice
bob
a quick time event is when a picture of a button shows on screen
you have to press the button in the picture to do something
oh
Cool idea. Sweet
<@!194259969359478784> got it?
and you have to press them in order to deal damage to all enemies in the room
wasd left right up down
every number stand for one button
tears still fire :<
well, do you know quick-time events?
never played that game
just the numerical representation of the last entered sequence
it random generates 4 numbers from 1 to 8
epicbob, think god of war, except there's no 'X' or 'O' graphics yet
i don't get it :(
no shit people were gonna get misleaded if the sprites won't show up
There's a whole thread with mod requests, <@267112861921181697>. You could look through that.
keys to press? how?
function arguments
I made a passive item that makes it so you can't gain tears up; instead, it gives you more damage
i need to figure this out
so
lmao
oh, now  I get it, not bad ?
but the technical part is working and I'm happy about that ?
I wanna make a passive item but I have no idea what to make
there will be sprites showing the keys to press
whatever
i dont understand the quick time event video
alright
ahh, nice!
are 1-8
"oh boi I'm proud I managed to do it" = some achievment ?
wasd and left right up down
the 4 digits are the keys to enter
<@166249905772429312> change line 5 to Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
the enemy goes where the tear was
he shoots a tear
30 frames is one second
but which achievement
says QTEs, where's the qte? ? 7242 and 0000 appeared when the timer went to 20
wait i think he means literal time events
The comment seems misleading. It's calling the update every *tick*, not *frame*.
oh yea that's a timer
just a timer
oh
Isaac.GetPlayer(0) right?
some timer? what :D?
Sunx, put the callbacks at the end of the file, looks much cleaner ?
er
<@120355885615808512> what's the achievment? some timer
yeah that should prevent him from firing tears
What even was that xbagon
oh I see it now
like this?
https://youtu.be/dtjYUoL4IJw
oh boi I'm proud I managed to do it
nice!
<@!194259969359478784> it's finally done
you never call the blindUpdate function
please pin this^
PSA: make sure to back up your mods, if the game updates it could delete shit
well, now you did
lmao
just did
i
easy to say when you didn't link it at first dude
herhp
sayin things firrst
instead of
MaxFireDelay is your attack speed
can people pls look at the thing
FireDelay is the CURRENT shooting timer
you can prevent tears firing by setting FireDelay to a number above 0 every update
fire delay is probably TearDelay
ay
https://hastebin.com/xapizekozi.lua
ugly workarounds is the norm
but it doesn't work
yes i did
you idiotic coding machine i do have an argument i think
Welcome to the wonderful world of modding games, where nothing works and everything is broken
fire delay*
just change the fire rate to 9999
you could always do the "worst case scenario" and make the script remove any tears
it totally mutes your fire ability
my item doens't have a specific ID
brimstone is tears
makes sense
etc.
brimstone
like spear of destiny
disables things MORE than tears
but canshoot= false
yes i know
both of those things can be done in players.xml
dont use main
ok first
ago
1.) make isaac stop shooting tears
2.) make him start with a custom item
I modded  terraria about a year
What are you trying to do
tbh, this isn't much worse than how dota modding was at first when it was released lol
Well
i just wish i could figure out how the hell to use floors right
neither are working
the main.lua does two things
What do you need help with?
it's not working
can someone help me with my mod?
Trust me, its really rewarding when it works
and then you solve it and it's super satisfying
yeah, that's usually the way it goes
That's AB+ for you
all weekend
iv been changing one thing, loading up a game, changing, another, etc over and over again XD
thanks
Just keep at it, it's a very iterative process ?
not very much though
yes
do you have any experience at all with programming?
UraniumBar:createItem() I'd wager
i am ?
<@!174193097285173250> probably wouldn't taste very good anyways ¯\_(?)_/¯
what jerbear said, don't expect us to write your mod, read the error message and look at the docs
i know it wants arguments
¯\_(?)_/¯
but
then why didn't you say so ?
it wants arguments
well read what it says
thats line 34
function createItem()
its a different error
<@121460786655657985> no. wolfs are extinct in my country. we only have like 3 in the whole county ?
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:34: function arguments expected near 'function'
just my 2 cents
Shock, if it's the same error, your problem isn't GetStage, it's something else
I want to do something differnt
I just didn't understand it yesterday
^
its totally possible
Detecting where atear died?
then again so is the rest of the api
still doesnt work hex6
super hacky
is some ways at least
Yes it is...
good api
because it isn't possible
no
please can someone help me make atear modifier
but all in one character
there is a random option in the play menu you know
hex6 let me try that
yes
so basically start with random items from some character?
etc.
and then 1 hp
but also dead bird
it might have the d6
e e e d d d e e e n n n
like
no but
How do you make a giant book effect appear on a new item?
Does anyone know how to start an animation on an entity?
e d en
hey what if someone made a new character that was actually just all the other ones mashed together
<@131576903722074112> can you help me make a tear modifier? I really don't know where to start...
Shock, what if you do Game():GetLevel() to get the level
ugh
<@!174193097285173250> have you actually tried a wolfmeat sausage at some point?
is GetStage not a workig method?
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:33: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetStage')
still happening
Yoooooour tears don't fall, they crash around me
I don't know anything about tears honeslty
can someone please help me with editing tear size?
also, you have a problem on line 40, "game" isntead of "Game"
let me double check
Is it Level() or Level? haven't really looked at the api yet
soree
stop asking so much
heeeelp

local shockfloor = Level:GetStage()

anyone know why this is happening?
good idea XD
<@!174193097285173250> nope :/. But i'll try the "subscribe to download trick to get one and see where it goes ?
and sunx replace line 8 ModName with KingdomHeartsMod
10/10 api.. player:GetMovementJoystick() returns NIL when you're not moving WTF?
So I did GetIdByName and it works fine, other than Insanity using the gold effect
also sunx replace `local ModName = RegisterMod("KingdomHeartsMod",1)`  with `local KingdomHeartsMod= RegisterMod("KingdomHeartsMod",1)`
alright
any help ?
does anyone know what is a room subtype is?
<@166249905772429312> on line 8 copy ```Lua

[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:33: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetStage')

local shockfloor = Level:GetStage()

whats wrong with it XD
honestly if it's not a weird mistake with GetItemIdByName I have no clue, it looks like it should work
that will do I hope
okay
sorry sunx i'll test it in a sec
```lua
function VectorToDirection(vek)
    if math.abs(vek.X) >  math.abs(vek.Y) then
        if vek.X > 0 then
            return Direction.RIGHT
        else
            return Direction.LEFT
        end
    elseif math.abs(vek.Y) >  math.abs(vek.X) then
        if vek.Y > 0 then
            return Direction.UP
        else
            return Direction.DOWN
        end
    end
end```
do it with greedes as well
only with insanity
I flipped the functions to see if it that had to do anything with it and now it only does the gold thing
<@121460786655657985> oh i didn't know about subscribing to a mod to get it downloaded, that can be very helpful. I'll try that ?
also, did you only change "local insanity" or did you change "local greedes" as well
so what do you want it to be?
<@!194259969359478784> https://hastebin.com/irosunowed.sql here is the minidump
Not anymore
or is it only running the other one
(1,0) (0,1) (1,1) (0,0)
<@267112861921181697> does it even run insanity's function?
<@88713604651552768> whats the content of that "Info.plist" file ?
Bagon what's an example of what the vector would be?
can it atleast be the coolest item ever afterwards? ?
<@88713604651552768> You can either download the mods manually and place them in that folder or subscribe to them on the workshop and then run the game once to get them downloaded
<@131576903722074112> Still giving me gold shit
?
god I hate my life
I'll have to calculate manually
good
yes
can I use math lib?
i just want it to equal false
<@88713604651552768>  the mod foldfer for mac is in ~\Library\Application Support\Bindding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\  or something similar to that ?
thats just a random variable name
im not trying to key it to an actual item
<@237683512944230401> local shockitem = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Name of item in Items.xml")
```
local    insanity = 931
```
rather than
```
local    insanity = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Insanity")
```
it's just an int
just put 511 or whatever
how would I just put just the ID?
<@121460786655657985> i'm trying to install mods (and i'll try to make some mods myself afterwards), but i can't find any help on how to do it on afterbirth + for mac
ender did i not when doing
shockitem = false
wait found the minidump
that's the log
https://hastebin.com/pekabejomi.sql
or true or whatever
if that doesn't work I dunno your issue
<@267112861921181697>, instead of using GetItemIdByName just put their IDs there
shockitem = false
one of those long name ones sunx
i thought i did
er
now I try the joystick input
you never registered shockitem as a variable most likely
<@!194259969359478784> haha that's what I tried, there was the problem with the head
yes
bob you mean this?
<@88713604651552768>  what's your rpoblem with mac?
anyway bagon what about this
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:32: attempt to index a nil value (global 'shockitem')

shockitem = false

what am i doing wrong?
```<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Heroes never die!" gfx="Healthcare.png" id="929" name="Healthcare" />

</items>
``` would this help? the id tags don't do anything
sort by date
ah
in the folder w/ log.txt
<@!174193097285173250> nope i can't find any help anywhere for afterbirth+ on mac. I only get tutorials on afterbirth :/
sorry i'm new to this
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:32: attempt to index a nil value (global 'shockitem')

shockitem = false

what am i doing wrong?
what's my minidump
uh
when I tried GetEntityTypeByName("Totally Black Screen") and GetEntityTypeByName("Link"), they would give the same ID for some reason despite the two entities having different IDs
what's your minidump say
i think there's more to it bob
game still crashes D:
it could possibly be due to GetItemIdByName weirdness
(1,0) is right
vectors are used for both
I need both effects separte
```function MyMod:use_insanity( )
    Game():Darken(1.0, 120);
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
            entities[ i ]:AddPoison( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
            entities[ i ]:AddShrink( EntityRef( player ), 120)
            entities[ i ]:AddFreeze( EntityRef( player ), 120)
            entities[ i ]:AddFear( EntityRef( player ), 240)
            entities[ i ]:AddConfusion( EntityRef( player ), 120, true )
        end
    end
    return(true)
end
function MyMod:use_greedes( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddGoldenBomb()
    player:AddGoldenKey()
    player:RemoveCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Essence of Greed"))
    return(true)
end
``` why does the top item have the function of the bottom item, but not vice versa?
not rotation
wait aren't vectors position
thx
let my look bagon
yes
yes sunx
nearest like North south east west
bob you mean i had to change this?
I dunno
<@!194259969359478784> an idea what's the fastest way to turn a vector into the nearest direction?
https://hastebin.com/dubonimaqe.lua
when I use the Insanity item the insanity item has its own effect AND the effect of the item below it
Why is the floor in the shape of a penis Travoos
yeah
it's pretty weird trying to make a new game out of entities
travois I am having an issue and epicbob cant seem to find it
nice travoos
player= Isaac.GetPlayer(0) <@166249905772429312>
didn't know that existed
https://gfycat.com/WaryFragrantFritillarybutterfly my new masterpiece
i
use hastebin Sunx
probably won't make a difference
bob could you take a look at this to see what i'm doing wrong?
http://pastebin.com/bjcJPi3w
return true = return(true)
I was hoping for fixes
oh
where?
true
anyway you don't need the ()
^^
found that out yesterday
that's why my thing wasn't working
yea
OHH
oh
it shows item animation
return true makes it so Isaac holds the item up
yes
are they needed?
ender
why do you have the `return(true)` statements
let me upload my main.lua
I don't know whats causing it
the player has to press specific buttons
runs still crash the game
https://hastebin.com/dubonimaqe.lua
what do you mean by input
i thought it was a glitch in your game
like I said I want to input smthing
oh
sucks
so what?
yea
ok
yes bagon
looking to the camera
alright
with the game after a short pause not shooting isaac always turns his head down
Yes
like this?
No, the item is still giving me golden keys and bombs...
weird xbagon
is this a problem with your mod or your game?
kingdomKeyID.KKCHAIN
I try to press up right left and it does up down right down left down
wait, because of this, is the item id
"KKCHAIN"
or "Kingdom Key"
why?
because it's screwing up my inputs
damn
<@120355885615808512> probably not
There was an extra end
nice
I found the culprit
your variables for greedes and insanity
what do you mean?
ender are your ids right?
alright
yes sunx
can I disable the automatic head turning to the front?
you mean like this bob?
hmm
```MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate )
MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube)
MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod.use_insanity, insanity)
MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, MyMod.use_greedes, greedes)```
i knew this wtf
oh yeah because * means times
Ender are you good? if not show me your AddCallback functions
<@166249905772429312> replace your update function with this
```Lua
function KingdomHeartsMod:onUpdate(player)
    if player:GetName() == "Sora" then
        if not rem then
            player:RemoveCollectible(id)
            if not player:HasCollectible(id) then
                rem= true
            end
        end
    end
end```
and add rem = false in your init function
or *[number]
* [number]
i think just like
How do i make an item that multiplies your damage

i have no idea how to do anything so i ask a bunch of questions
ok
also do i replace something with the thing you showed me
still crashes
don't use global shock
i changed some things
kingdomKeyID.KKCHAIN
[INFO] - ERR: ...s/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/uranium bar/main.lua:33: syntax error near 'shockfloor'

global shockfloor = Level:GetStage()

whats wrong with it?
only insanity copies EOG
No, it doesnt
just replace id with whatever it is
my item doesn't have a specific id
and can i see your callbacks
<@267112861921181697> does it work the other way around?
yes ender 1 sec
<@166249905772429312> 
```Lua
function mod:init()
    rem= false
end
function mod:update()
    if not rem then
        player:RemoveCollectible(id)
        if not player:HasCollectible(id) then
            rem= true
        end
    end
end```
When i use Insanity, it gives me golden keys and golden bombs like Essence of Greed
```function MyMod:use_insanity( )
    Game():Darken(1.0, 120);
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
            entities[ i ]:AddPoison( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
            entities[ i ]:AddShrink( EntityRef( player ), 120)
            entities[ i ]:AddFreeze( EntityRef( player ), 120)
            entities[ i ]:AddFear( EntityRef( player ), 240)
            entities[ i ]:AddConfusion( EntityRef( player ), 120, true )
        end
    end
    return(true)
end
function MyMod:use_greedes( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddGoldenBomb()
    player:AddGoldenKey()
    player:RemoveCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Essence of Greed"))
    return(true)
end```
<@!194259969359478784> Can you help me real quick? two of my active items' effects are mashed together and I dunno why
define player as get player
player.Damage + math.random
i'll give you my code
the game won't register it
Sunx you can't give an item that early
is there anyway to make an item increase your damage by a random amount upon pick up?
Anyway, I have a bit of an issue
Pastel on dark
Sorry, misread
I use Monokai
Neat
HotFudgeSundae
also
nvm again
It looks nice
Sunx what colour scheme do you use?
why isn't it working?
this is supposed to make Sora(isaac) get an item when the run starts

it didn't really help too much but at least i got a little bit from it
I spent the last few hours researching lua
Anyone know how to get an animation working? I thought it would work on spawn but it dosen't
I am back
hello
Ok thanks
wait nvm i see
Level:GetStage()
no behind it
this crashes my game when i start a run, anyone know why?
do i put that around level:getstage?
ah
that's wrong
()
global shockfloor = Level:GetStage
whats wrong with this code?
<@88713604651552768> sorry i had to do something important... did you found a solution ?
cya
is it just if not?
whats the wording for if not
hm
thanks
c ya
cya
anyways, im of to bed!
ok
you need a global variable
when Level:GetStage changes
im fairly new to semi-complex coding
i am XD
Look at the Level class
how the heck do i trigger something when you go to a different floor?
damn
Has anyone gotten Isaac.WorldToScreenDistance to work correctly in big rooms?
use paint Kappa
Does anybody know how to recolor brimstone or mom's knife?
for mod items
511 is the first id
yes
Is it possible to spawn a mod item with that command?
?
alright thanks 3
oh thanks god
and then theyre in my game?
yes
we just subscribe to them
yes <@185068618776576000> spawn 5.100.itemid
do they work like the dont starve mods?
search megabrim
if that's what you want
you could use megabrim to kill everything
Is there anyway to spawn item pedestals with the console?
now what ;-;
anyone know how to tell if you went to the next floor?
found it
steam library yes
in my library ?
in your steam when you have binding of isaac rebirth selected scroll down and click on workshop
whats the link for that
no need for old mods
just visit steam workshop for afterbirth+ you will find enough op stuff
but it doesnt??
how do i check to see if its a new floor?
it would work yea
its all the same no?
wouldnt it work tho?
that's an afterbirth mod
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1316/extremely-overpowered-start-afterbirth
a rooms folder
what do you have in the zip file
what's your items name?
what do i put in that folder bagon? the binding of isaac afterbirth + mods folder
I try to give myself an item from my mod but it gives me a bad gas pill
the mod file!
huh
help?
i wanted to change the HP of an enemy by adding an edited entities2.xml file to my mod folder but it doesnt work ?
the winrar
do you try to install a mod or what?
zip?`
oh do i put the zip file in there?
are the mods
documents\mygames\afterbirth+ mods
no
and i did
-Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources
-Drop the rooms folder there
-Profit
it said to do this
anti birth, afterbirht afterbith plus rebirth
i have everything
this was what the readme file said
do you have both ab and ab+?
guys why wont my mods work :C
like an item pedestool
how do you delete an item?
so i can emulate getting an item
i want to see the chances of getting one item
why do you need to know the number
so about 318 items
and theres one space in between each one
looks like it takes up about 636 lines
lets see
i really dont want to count how many items are in it
i still have no idea how to tell how many items are in the treasure room pool
lets see
nop. no update
uh
item pools yet?
I'm back
what does any of that mean
woah
look with the item pool editor
how many items are in the item room pool?
that makes sense
yeah
so I guess it doesn't work because I use post update
ok xD
my bad
confused sth xD
nvm
a is 100 then
string,x,y,r,g,b,a
what
RGB ALPHA RGB(offset)
anyone know how many items are in the treasure room pool?
oh thought it's the last
your alpha val is 0
do I have to use render?
yeah
because I cannot see it xD
is this correct? Isaac.RenderText("text",100,100,0,0,0,100)
how many items are in the treasure item pool?
atm I go with RenderText and try to finish the item first
id love to do that for debug reasons, but im too lazy to write all that youst for debug. goddamn
didn't try yet
<@120355885615808512> did you manage to render a sprite on the screen?
god that was annoying
praise the lord~
i figured it out
oh god this item will be hard
?
<@120355885615808512> No. Are you really that lazy? cmon man ?
the name should be in it
you can look into the metadata.xml file in the folders
can someone copy me a RenderText() with nice parameters xD
maybe its their id?
cant help you with that ?
all these god damn numbers
which one is it XD
Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\250900

<@237735158369746945> no, always wondered why there is a damage parameter
<@!174193097285173250>
<@206614636806668292> just use basement renovator, there's a patch on modding of isaac for it
anyone know how to make the burns do damage other than your damage?
The AB+ room editor keeps crashing for me
hey guys
<@88713604651552768> can you make a screenshot of the folder where the "resources" folder is in ? (so i can see what files are in there)
thats the only way im seeing to apply that. not sure how to add the amn2 animation fule
are poops spawned with the command spawn different than poops spawned by the game?
so i need to make the tear effect into a sprite sheet and put it in gfx/effects?
<@!174193097285173250> nope nothing like it
regarding room mods, does anyone know how greed spawning works with large shops? Does it actually work, or does it just crash the game?
lol
ohh i see now
ok so i see the effect variant list, but how do i put in a custom effect
<@88713604651552768> is there a file called "savedatapath.txt" in the folder where the "resources" folder is located ?
I need that collision cos my fire has movement vector
yea
RED_CANDLE_FLAME
Too bad ;< i will use
:/
oh
HI i'm trying to install mods on mac. I found the packed folder in resources, but i don't know if there is a mod folder as on windows. Does anyone know ?
<@120355885615808512> HOT_BOMB_FIRE Wont bounce of a walls, it just slides out of room
wolfsauge god ?

yes
Tutorial on how to enable achievements again for Lua / non Lua mods:
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mtl0b/how_to_enable_achievements_for_resource_lua_mods/
HOT_BOMB_FIRE
effectvariant
as in entity effect
Did you made it or its allready implemented?
HOT_BOMB_FIRE
<@120355885615808512>
you said there was fire that didnt blocked tears
and then I could add a burn
but I had to check all entities when they were damaged.. from what
easy
if there would be something like lastthingitdealtdamageto
ok so if i change ENTITY_EFFECT to ENTITY_TEAR that should change the tear effect?
i kno, i hate fucking with new enteties but atm you have to
and I added a burning effect to the enemies... that was a pain in the ass
it damages yea, for my thing I used HOT_BOMB_FIRE because it doesn't block tears
Like damages enemies?
Its still works tho?
thanks
ooh
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT,EffectVariant.RED_CANDLE_FLAME,0,player.Position,Vector(0,0),player)
<@120355885615808512>  So can you paste the spawn line?
Yeah thats the one
becaus I did this <@220525353830055936> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1slaRTYd464
oh okay  ENTITY_EFFECT ->  RED_CANDLE_FLAME
<@120355885615808512> Just want to remake redcandle for practise
then render()
load an anm
sprite = Sprite()
<@112975821186031616> i'll pm it to you
<@220525353830055936> I'm the right one for this, but first for what do you need it
<@120355885615808512> render()
how do i spawn red candle fire, ENTITY_FIREPLACE  ?
what is the most effective way to render a sprite on the screen?
Isaac.Spawn
the only spawn function i can find in the docs is SpawnEntityDesc
do i need a separate function?
how do i do that?
you need to spawn them
Yikes. What's your players.xml look like?
but how to I code that into the main.lua
INCLUDING characters i don't have
yes i did that
local
and then apply the anm2 to the sprite
all the blank spots are characters as well
<@267469661812031489> i think you could do that with entity:getSprite
the fuck is this
i made the animation and coded the entity in entities.xml

uhhh
yeah i made it
Mate if you want to edit tears you need to learn how to make entities
or is it still bugged
Sorry, I haven't dealt with animations.
Red Flame is the one that will wont hurt player?
oh ok
Ah, didn't see it.
<@112975821186031616> they're trying to change tear projectiles, they posted a bit earlier about it
They need to update or remake the api, or make proper documentation if this one is so great
<@267469661812031489> didnt se you were writing
Don't know about the others, but I certainly can't help you if I don't know what's wrong.
Would definitely be nice if we had access to more, I agree. The only item I've made so far has needed a workaround, even.
so nobody can help me?
but i love it
i hate it
my whole code is a giant fucking workaround atm
He can get the entities in the room. He can find their position. He can compare their position to the position of his familiar. He can deal damage to them.
thats kinda bullshit coz 3/4 of this functionts wont work with some kind of walkaround
tahts true
I'm not saying it's great, but it has plenty of what people need just by looking up function names.
honestly. there is not much to read
You need to learn how to read it.
just fucks me
the doc fucks me
At least try to do it a bit yourself, <@171044322781691904>. This channel shouldn't be about people making your mod for you while you take the credit.
wat
can I do if Vector in Vector then ?
not really
nah theres no collision detection
nn
ty for help
night
good night
is there collition detection
See ya.
g'night
ok now how do I do so he does damage to ennemies
https://redd.it/5mtl6e
doesn't make him invisible
I like how setting punching bag's visible to false
sweet
! he stays close
Oh, right, I guess it makes sense if  you want to change it
it works
<@126590786945941504> its just so he can adjust the speed, Resized works on all levels
I put 10
Do `:Normalized()`
Don't do Resized(1)
```poper.Velocity = (poper.Position - player.Position):Resized(1)```
Or maybe he just doesn't like you.
looks like it
i fucked up the + and - I think
wait
yeah...
wait, he moves AWAY? from you?
looks like tank controls
<@109624258317033472> He starts twicthing in the corners
ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM wont return player when used as Callback?
shhot on all poops and enemies?
cool. but what exactly does that do?
Proof of concept: https://streamable.com/sqvgl
in the ifs
i do
but just makes him twitch
<@171044322781691904> it does not check the distance tho. you might wanna check that the distance is less then 100 before doing that
That works
<@109624258317033472> let me try that
what i've been trying to do is get an item to change the tear entity (like death's touch). I have the item coded, i have the anm2 file for the tear animation. i coded it into entities2.xml. the item is in my main.lua and it has a graphic and i can pick it up. Just can't figure out how to apply the new tear animation
oh and the hud doesn't seem to update luck..
if i wrote that correctly
try it with poper.Velocity = (player.Position - poper.Position):Resized(1)
I jsut want to test I guess
but if it works, it works
You're setting Position instead of adding velocity or something else humane
^
Your code is weird
<@126590786945941504> ?
hey guys, I'm a little new to modding, trying to find resources and stuff is kinda tough
Though the entire thing is weird
oops
yeah
<@171044322781691904> You wanted `- 100` in the second `if`, no?
thx
oh cool
You can do `ply.ControlsEnabled = false` to disable the player movement but still get joystick input
<@109624258317033472> Can you help me? why isnt this working
The shooting joystick is tears
The movement joystick is, well, movement
Each returns a vector
There's two functions
probably
Yes
yea but can I see if it was shooting or walking?
if you know what i mean
oh maybe
kind of
key are emulated joysticks
i think
nah
for real
ONLY?
I thought it was only joystick presses
joystick input
I read about the possibility to see key presses in the api? does anyone knows where to find that?
that its not unique
that would make sense
maybe ENtity.Index is buged
definetly fucking not
<@109624258317033472> You fucked it up, basically. You probably got the wrong Entity in your code.
No, that's not it, not in this case
This API. what the literal fuck. I change animatins of my custom Entity. and suddenly. ISAAC plays his animation with the same name ("Down").  his sprite is nowhere mentioned in that code?! how does that even happen.
if you know what I mean
maybe 1.000000000000000 isn't = 1.0
They don't just skip a beat or something
Floats don't do weird magical operations, especially not on numbers this small
But that's not the problem here
A floating-point number, anyways
double
Or a double, or whatever
Because number is a float
because lua has "number" and not integer AND float
^^
Indeed weird
hmm
but a few days ago
me too Kappa
already uploaded it to steam
don't copy MY MOD TY
Show your goddamn code
Before you blame it on Lua
and it did work the one time and it didn't  the other
Whole mod, we can't know if you change the number somewhere else
I mean I just changed that
what do you want
wat
That's not your whole code
and it didn't work
I just had == instead of >=
here
```lua
local MagicalPlantTearsUp = 0

function Xitems:MagicalPlant_use()
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        MagicalPlantTearsUp = MagicalPlantTearsUp + 0.05
        if MagicalPlantTearsUp >= 1.0 then
            player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay - 1
            MagicalPlantTearsUp = 0
        end
end
```
Next to
need to be inside resources, or next to it
does the contents folder
uh
yes
Also, there's no reason not to use `>=` in this case
Then show the code and prove it
that's the point
I don't
Unless you do that twice in a row before checking
but if I do += 0.5 x times someday it will be 1.0
You always have to do `>` if you can't guarantee the value to be exactly the same
It's like saying `1.95==2`, that's false, then that's weird
oh
never did that
what
And valid in any language
That's completely normal
ty
lol
"If you're ever directly comparing numbers in Lua (i.e. ==) that aren't guaranteed to be integers, you're doing it wrong."
it does I read
Show your full code
>= works
Before you say that
No
lua does number things weird
ok yes
<@126590786945941504> any idea? maybe I'm comparing floats wrong
but okay
they were working earlier though
The `items.xml` and `players.xml`
no put items.xml in content
Those are supposed to go into `content`
my folders
erm


the main.lua
what was hte last thing you changed?
?
seems fine
and this is the main.lua
seems fine
that's the xml file
because it isn't set to 0 either

but it doesn't change
probably mistake in the xml file <@166249905772429312>
i haven't managed to change maxfiredelay on found hud myself
<@126590786945941504> oh sorry, I'm mixing up local with the x = getx and stuff like that. Thanks
now my isaac just crashes
doesn't change the stat
i removed the item id and put the thing in main.lua
no idea
that's my code
```lua
if rand == 1 then
        Isaac.DebugString(MagicalPlantTearsUp)
        MagicalPlantTearsUp = MagicalPlantTearsUp + 0.05
        if MagicalPlantTearsUp == 1.0 then
            player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay - 1
            MagicalPlantTearsUp = 0
        end
```
So if you use the same variable name in another scope, or another mod entirely, it won't overwrite the original
<@120547369761767428> No, `local` declares a variable to be local to the scope
i saw some video which did it
idk
yes
<@166249905772429312> No, why would you think that?
new to coding - all local does is compress stuff right? instead of putting a big command in you could just use 'a' or something
Are you running that function repeatedly?
do i put a ,1 after the item name
Unless, y'know
totally
I think your isaac might be haunted
XBagon
erm
Not using `local` won't break your mod in 90% of the cases, but it's good practice to use it
Isaac.DebugString(MagicalPlantTearsUp) -> Lua Debug: 1.0
if MagicalPlantTearsUp == 1.0 then
MagicalPlantTearsUp = 0
end
Isaac.DebugString(MagicalPlantTearsUp) -> Lua Debug: 1.05

WHAT
Also do `local` before variables, like `local player` in your function
Also `local kingdomKeyId = Isaac.GetItemblahblahblah`
Look at how the hothead item does it, under the nicalis example mods
And you need to wrap the name in `""`
forget to remove that
woops
Why do you have StartDebug()?
like so?
Though not sure if that'd fix anything
You should use `Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Item Name")`
lemme try it now
ah
To ensure no conflicts between mods
The ID gets autogenerated by the game
<@126590786945941504> ?
Overall
<@267635009119191040> What you are actualy working on?
why not
Don't provide an id
woob could you help me with my problem
awesome
despite not losing hp
punching bag still fires dmg events
YES
that's my mods items.xml
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="The Keyblade's true form" gfx="collectibles_kh_kingdomkeychain.png" id="511" name="Kingdom Key" />    
</items>
so
but it's changes work
players.xml is in resources
Ah. Huh. That seems like it could be used toward making a melee weapon, though, couldn't it?
also
no?
w/s drives forwards/backwards
a/d changes direction
What is that even doing, <@126590786945941504>?
not in resources
.xml belong in a "content" folder
and now i made it it's own item
ah found your mistake
earlier i was using another item as a base for it
it's enabled
yes
supra isaaco kart
doubt it. But is the mod listed in the menu?
https://streamable.com/880ja
The damage callback doesn't work at all, <@267635009119191040>?
is that casuing it?
bear in mind my item isn't referenced in main.lua yet
<@267635009119191040> waht do you want? see when it gets damaged?
*It's uploading*
so
but it works
player.xml has the same extension
I did a stupid thing
guys

<@109624258317033472>
it must be hardcoded
punching bag's hp doesn't go down?
oh no
sure
wait does shot speed affect range?
and I increase the range with TearFallingSpeed, it works, but the hud doesn't update
the code above doesn't work
what's the problem then
oh
that it has to be set in evaluate cache
it does
I read in the docs
Oh, does changing `player.Damage` for example not work?
<@267635009119191040> I don't use cache because stats are changed on item use
Sun, might be because your extension is .XML not .xml, im not sure if that matters tho
I don't need a new entity
should update it
:/
hardcoded the IDs
there's my punching bag
```lua
    local tearsup = 0
tearsup = tearsup + 0.05
        if tearsup == 1 then
            player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay - 1
            tearsup = 0
        end```
this doesn't work somehow
theeeeeere we go
<@166249905772429312> go look at logs.txt in your Documents/BiddingOfIsaacAfterbirth
woob was the cache thing directed at me
yes you have to lower maxfiredelay
and a `cache` attribute in the item in items.xml
you have to lower maxfiredelay i think
you have to use the evaluate cache callback
yes
tears up is maxfiredelay right?
uhm how do I update the range stat and the tears up stat on the hud ? ?
can someone help me?
I don't even need to handle much
on the punching bag
I could use the entity dmg callback
go look at logs.txt
So its borkd
yo
it doesn't even show up in the console
but i can't spawn it with the debug console
i made an item
okay um
or guillotine, dont know if those use familiars ^^
the weird thing though is that I got the id from the method to get id by name
that's probably it
Oh yes
`spawn isaac` in the console does that
IsHoldingItem() can be used with GetItemIdByName()?
from the scissors maybe?
wat
spawn isaac?
and shoots along with me
I spawned a head that looks identical to isaac's
ok what the actual fuck
-something that lets you kill off your familiars for heart containers
-something that lets you kill off your heart containers(or 3 soul/black hearts) for a random familiar
which is probably what I'm gonna do when I decide to clean up this mess
yeah, im desperatly waiting for the new update D:
use a preprocessor that will merge everything into one file
oooooor
you'd have to split it into separate mods at most
because no relative require
right now
you kind of can't
scayze
god i really want to split my main.lua into multiple ones. 800 lines are getting too much to look over
i'm gonna list a bunch of item ideas that i don't need
oh nvm
isaac update?
problem is it also can decrease a stat
k I'll try
The uh, red pickaxe does, I think.
is there an active that changes stats permanently?
Seems weird that it'd be different between your item and any other item.
yea
Oh, *your* item.
wat
no that's a modded item
and now void does funky stuff
Also that's a discussion for <#264851654627688450>.
I ate my item that highers one stat
Did you eat an item that does funky stuff?
wtf does void do with stats just randomly wtf? my active highers stats.. I eat it with void and they get lowered. and when I activate void sometime they get higher and afterwards the highered stat will get lowered because????
i tried player:GetActiveItem() == SpellBookId as well
I don't think you would want me to make you sprites.
The collectible effects you can assign seem annoyingly random. brother bobby,  stop watch, transcendence and book of shadows works, but not brimstone, book of revelations, pentagram, or cricket's body
Give me sprites :V
Someone should make a punching bag. With fists. That punches everything.
I'm gonna name it Punching Hack
Ignore first line tho its backup file
http://pastebin.com/xDXeMtQp
does your spellpower start at 0 and only increase when you use the active item?
Still cant get this active item passive bonus to work
I've seen it
Ever consider picking up Pico-8? That thing's practically built around restrictions.
will it crash or will it render invisible? let's see
Any halp mates?
if I don't specify the anm2 path
hmmm
ok time to actually work on this
I like restrictions
Tha API is bad, but indeed. its kinda fun to get hacky
(command blocks)
I was using methods like these when I used to play minecraft
Ah memories
I was using this method when i was moding Little Fighters 2 :V
not just working around crashes, but using things in unintended ways to get a result with less work
The fun kind of hackery
and wanted
This is the kind of hackery I expected
Maybe 20-25%, probably.
That coudl work
I'd constantly set its position
If I made an item that increases damage to champions, how much damage extra should it do? Right now, my item deals double damage to champions, but I think it might be too much
then I'd test for its health
that has a fully transparent sprite
what if I had a punching bag
crazy idea but
yo
the problem is that it still won't be affected by brimstone etc :/
actually
can void activate duplicate actives?
so that I get a vector
I should subtract the projectile position from the bullet position
not distance
If it doesn't work try the other way around, not sure if order of operations matters for multiplying vectors by a scalar
actually
get distance from the center to the entity position
get the center - ^/2
get the collision box - entity.Size * entity.SizeMulti
ok so
Nice
an enemy bullet is a Projectile while a player bullet is a Tear
except its actually an ellipsoid so you'll get a vector
and an enemy bullet
how would I even distinguish between a player bullet
I think the radius is entity.Size * entity.SizeMulti
also
As i said there is something implemented but it wont work
I don't think there is a method to get the collision radius?
ummmmm
Well :V If it works (some times) its not stupid
<@267635009119191040> yes
<@220525353830055936> that's the radius of a tear with isaac's damage and no items
the distance is from the center right?
<@128874748041101312>  why 24 tho?
true
can't I grab the collision radius
well uh
I'm gonna go
nice
but that wouldn't work for bigger bullets
24
I want to change small amounts
<@267635009119191040> you could check if the distance between the position of the bullet and the entity is smaller than 24
they dont work properly atm
why the fuck has MaxFireDelay to be an integer
there are enums for that but i dont think so
or make the bonus being smaller only happen once you pick up the item
picking up the item would only give you an unnoticeable boost
I want to detect bullets hitting my entity
as in
is there any simple way to do collision checking?
the numbers are already calculated by the time you get to the chest
such as the chest
in later stages
besides, you encounter bosses commonly on floors
and it will be good on boss rush just not that op
it will be still wortj
just make every bonus 1/4 smaller than ealier
If you get the item late game it wont benefit oyu at all
But then the item looses its value...
+ damage / encounteredbossnumber
Or once a room
sounds a good idea
from one before
Make just every next bonus smaller <@267112861921181697>
gives you about 100 damage
Boss Rush
Why tho?
Wont work
player:GetActiveItem() == SpellBookId
doesn't multiply upon more bosses being found, now just gies you one attack
has been nerfed
op as fuck
the item works on boss rush
guys
I do get the costume at least
neither the tears up or the spawning
that's odd, I can give myself brother bobby, but I can't replicate the effect of squeezy
I didn't pass anything, since I used a dot. The code was `room:GetDoor(DoorSlot.DOWN0).ExtraSprite.GetFilename ()`
perhaps, I'll check if just regular familiars work
I'm just trying to do something really simple, making the old two-charge item it's own thing :V
The Book of Shadows is an effect that's applied to Isaac. I'm guessing spawning things isn't considered an effect.
ah, right, lilith's thing
then you passed the wrong value
oh, really?
<@267635009119191040> doubles familiars
so i guess that was the problem
I haven't played since a while ago
I guess those aren't considered 'effects'.
what even is box of friends?
I know, but the error message was the weird part. I was telling me that a sprite was expected and the variable was userdata
Seems like it should work, yeah.
<@98714693857722368> `a:b(c)` is in every single way except error messages equivalent to `a.b(a, c)`
if I replace it with book of shadows, it works
<@112975821186031616> player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BOX_OF_FRIENDS, true)
I'll try that
How are you adding it?
Oh, i was probably calling it wit . not :
<@112975821186031616> must just be bugged then
`sprite` is userdata
<@120547369761767428> One of the sample mods use the Book of Shadows as an example using AddCollectibleEffect().
so you just call `sprite:Load(abc)` for example
it'll return a userdata with all the methods, functions and fields of the Sprite class as defined in the docs
that it returns a Sprite
for example, if it says in the docs
you literally just call functions/methods or access fields on it
you don't convert it to anything
and before that is table
the most advanced data type in lua is userdata
I mean, in the docs it says class, but yeah, its a table
lua has no """class"""es either
Well, yeah, a lua """class""""
It has mechanisms that can be used to implement them
Lua has no classes
nor does box of spiders
<@267635009119191040>  Oh, so how do I handle it? Does the API has anything to change it back to a lua class?
is there an equivalent for AddCollectibleEffect() for active items? Book of Revelations doesn't do anything.
yes
GetActiveItem() reffers to spacebar item?
FireTear is a method that fires the player's tear
<@267112861921181697> I'm pretty sure it's just boss rooms
What, is FireTear a float or something?
IMAGINE BOSS RUSH WITH THIS ITEM
any C module object's type is userdata
GUYS
Im pretty sure the code is right
it returns an userdata instead of a sprite
The thing with the ExtraSprite could be one?
Talking about bugs
Yeah, thought you added, not multiplied.
Oh, that strange. Tweet it at Edmund he likes to know about this kind of bugs
Its old now
No, that'd be just as bad.
<@112975821186031616> how much is `0 * 0.5`?
Same arguments (same mod even) run normally on Windows
That would give the player an extra 0.5 on a new run, though, wouldn't it? Shouldn't it be `if bosses_defeated >= enc_bosses`?
<@220525353830055936> EntityPlayer::FireTear crashes on Linux no matter the arguments
k
at least I don't think so?
I kno but what is the problem <@267635009119191040>
no
wait.. If I just change stats on item use.. do I need the cache?
<@220525353830055936> operating system
ah k. weird o.o
```    if player:HasCollectible( bloodpower ) then
        if boss_encounters ~= Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() then 
            boss_encounters = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses()
            local bossdamagemult = boss_encounters * 0.5 + player.Damage
            player.Damage = bossdamagemult
        end
    end```
Wait what?! Platform?
it works on windows
it's a platform specific issue
Yeah it crashes on Linux
oh ok ty
<@267635009119191040> have you gotten FireTear to work? out of curiosity
just adapt that code
<@120355885615808512> https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/group___enumerations.html#ga32a9a3d125cc93d397abbd4f63f07f29
this shuold work without new run resetting code because when you start a new run, GetNumEncounteredBosses will return 0
```lua
mod = RegisterMod("abc", 1)
local bosses_defeated = 0
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, function()
  enc_bosses = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses()
  if bosses_defeated ~= enc_bosses
    bosses_defeated = enc_bosses
    player.Damage = player.Damage + bosses_defeated * 0.5
  end
end
```
really? all?
and range isn't correct I think ?
I think ranged is bugged atm
try "all"
what are all the stat keywords for cache? cache="damage speed range" is what I have
But if you left the run its kinda reset, aka actual bug with reseting Void items consumed
Damage math
boss_encounters = METHODFORBOSS ENOUCNTERS
yup
so inside of the if block
the only thing left after that is the callbacks
when the mod is enabled
the game runs the script once
I find that hard to believe
local bosses = 0
really?
if you declare them with value
if you have it set to boss_encounters not equals num of encountere~
locals reset themself on new run
I think you might not even need the new run checking
actually
and when you detect a new run, you just reset the `boss_encounters` variable to 0
```lua
BossesDefeated = 0
if Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() > BossesDefeated then
  BossesDefeated = BossesDefeated + 1
  player.Damage = player.Damage + 0.5
end```
so you use <@126590786945941504>'s new run detection
That way it only runs when it changes, however, the problem is now that if you start a new run you'll keep the bonus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0lHQ6ML-uY
and do your damage math
inside the if block, you update boss_encounters with the return value of the method
This has (kinda) all of you need https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/index.html
then, in post update check if `boss_encounters ~= THEMETHODTOGETBOSSENCOUNTERS`
<@267112861921181697> have a variable at the top, `local boss_encounters = 0`
<@267635009119191040> could work if you just get the damage save it in a varibale and then set damage to that + bosses*?
Hi guys. I'm trying to dynamically switch door sprites, but `Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoom():GetDoor(DoorSlot.DOWN0).ExtraSprite ` is returning an userdata instead of a sprite. Is this normal?
anyone else had trouble with getting item effects? Stuff like the book of shadows or telepathy works, but box of friends or book of revelations doesn't work.
That would have the same problem, only less often.
to enter new floor you need to defeat boss
I just don't know how to properly impletment them into my mods
Try calling it on entering new floor
I understand basic concepts
it'll just keep increasing the damage
because it's in post update
why's that
<@128874748041101312> won't work
because you lack understanding of basic programming concepts
<@267112861921181697> ...```lua
    if player:HasCollectible( bloodpower ) then
        local bossdamagemult = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() * 1.5 

        player.Damage = player.Damage + Game:GetNumEncounteredBosses() * bossdamagemult
    end```
why is that so difficult to do honestly
I just want to make an item that increases damage based on how many bosses you find
~~I think you should wait for the Antibirth API~~
anyone?
dont work :c
I think you should take more time learning programming than modding BoI.

ah
`SpellBookMod.onCache` is `nil` when you add the callback
I just pasted it here reversed
rip me
How do you keep a tear in the air like anti gravity?
I fucking failed
you're adding the callback before you define the function
Ok my code isn't working
also
how can I change stats on item use?
`HasCollectible`
Idk what is borkd
SpellBookMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, SpellBookMod.onCache)
function SpellBookMod:onCache(player, cacheFlag)
    if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
        if player:HasCollectible(SpellBookId) then

found nothing on GER keybord so far ^^
A little hacky but I found a way to make a cap and add the damage without it being constant
for UK keyboard at least
just use the ' under the @ symbol
nah
to eng(US)
it'll open if you have any mods enabled
you might have to change keyoard layout
no
i have to activate the console?
dont work

there's no way to affect music tempo at the moment, right?
no other way to change the thumbnail afaik

I tried to use this to disable tears, but it didn't work. Any suggestions?
guess ima have to make a new entity
what about making an entity able to be hurt by other enemies/explosions
I don't see a way to change target
good question, probably? you may be able to set their collision damage to 0, but i haven't tried
but I will still take damage from touching them right?
When it's uploaded to the workshop
just set their target to other enemies.*
How do you edit the thumbnail picture for the mod?
yeah
just set their target to other enemies?
cause I want to recreate the dirty mind item
Quick question
Is there a way to make an Enemy AI friendly without charmed?
I couldn't figure out how to keep the two variables seperate
^
You didn't even try the global variable like I suggested, did you <@267112861921181697>?
second loop: damage is 1.5, 1 boss encountered, damage is 2
how would I even do that though?
first loop: damage is 1, 1 boss encountered, damage is 1.5
you don't run it only when you encounter a new boss
and you add damage
that you run it every single frame
your problem is
He moved it to the other variable.
Oh, right.
I want to make it so it doesn't completely nullify the effects of other damage boosting items
no
Yeah, you're gonna have 0 damage at the start of the game.
and you're wondering why it's being added?
I accidently double pasted that sorry
**`+ player.Damage`**
My item does that it will add one soul heart here´s code https://hastebin.com/yololanezu.lua
```lua
local bossdamagemult = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() * 0.5 + player.Damage
player.Damage = bossdamagemult
```
First of all, why do you have 2 `MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate )`?
I just copy pasted the whole thing
https://hastebin.com/ejigajofaj.lua
<@267112861921181697> all the relevant code
I think he meant the whole code.
<@267112861921181697> I think he means all of it
https://hastebin.com/edikitiyuk.lua
<@267112861921181697> can you hastebin the code
how did you make that happen by accident
no I mean
How does that confuse you, <@267635009119191040>?
I know, my item was called like that and it didnt work so I renamed it to Haunted Soul
*how*
```
The issue is that when I enter a boss room it constantly adds damage to itself
```
By the way, these already an item called The Soul
No, it is.
Is it?
The issue is that when I enter a boss room it constantly adds damage to itself
~~Well it's not going to find thesoul.png there.~~
and I have thesoul.png in resources/gfx/items/collectibles

Do you have an `items.xml` that contains your item?
oh I found it thanks!
Right in your first if statement.
where?
wait
oh sorry
He's talking to EnderShot.
What is HasUnseenMod doing, <@267673192372371467>?
where did you find 3 equals?
with that function
I have no idea where you got `===` from
`a = a + 3` sets `a` to `a + 3`, so adds `3` to its current value
<@267112861921181697> `a = 3` sets `a` to `3`
there is my code https://hastebin.com/yololanezu.lua

you have an error
The number shouldn't be relative unless you explicitly make it relative in the first place, <@267112861921181697>.
and ite even didint spawned
but it didnt
And that item should gave me a soul heart
I created an item named Haunted Soul

DISCORD
***DIIIISCOOOOOORD***
oh no discord
I have a problem
I'm so fucking confused
I have a problem
guys
Welcome to the world of EnderShot
no, s**m**h
I mean
guys
smh
I mean
wtf
what do yo umean relative to the number
`varname = value`?
you mean
how do I add something so it isn't relative to the number that already exists, but changes the variable to that
never mind
u wot m8
Are you sure you're not reading JS?
the fuck
C#
***__w  h  a  t__***
Where did you get `===` from?
*what*
So instead of adding 5 to the damage, it makes the damage five
what
how you assign a variable directly, not relatively?
is ===
Wait
Also spawns 4 random items
And you can only have 3 full hearts and heart containers at a time
Hearts gets turned into coins
All stats up, TearDelay and Damage multiplier
https://streamable.com/gm67x
The function might be overcomplicated, it's hard to tell exactly what's necessary and what isn't
Thanks, Kube.
i don't understand a way to keep my BossEncounter separate from the real variable
like ```lua
local first = false

local function onUpdate()
    local ply = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

    if first then
        first = false
        if isNewGame() then
            dat = {}```
You have to use it with a flag in MC_POST_UPDATE
Doesn't work in MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT or whatever was the name
```lua
local function isNewGame()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    return game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1
end```
mentioned because I don't
Have a link for that?
<@126590786945941504> had a complete new run detecting function
That too.
reset the global variable on a new run
also
so
The way I'd do it: Make a global variable that keeps track of how many bosses you defeated. If the number of bosses defeated is more than the amount in that variable, update the player damage and set the bosses defeated to the new value.
because when I enter the boss room, instead of adding 0.5 to my damage once, it adds extreme amounts of damage in seconds
this line of code repeats every tick but I only want it to repeat once time until the number rises ``        local bossdamagemult = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() * 0.5
        player.Damage = player.Damage + bossdamagemult``
sucks
I think i did everything to add a variant i just can't spawn it in game
Can you help me real fast
thank you
i didn't mean you're mean, i meant you're busy
Anyways, I told you everything I knew last night.
o h n o
i knew it all along
Sorry, we're mean and don't like to help you.
plz
can someone here help me with my enemy variant mod?
A passive item that gives you a damage multiplier based on the number of full red hearts you have, as long as all of your red hearts are full.
just a few items
dont have all the pngs
How would you flavor this item?
i know but
they're individual images for every item
items*
Would that work to some extent
```    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible( bloodpower ) then
        local bossdamagemult = Game():GetNumEncounteredBosses() * 0.5
        player.Damage = player.Damage + bossdamagemult
    end```
Hey, the collectibles png dont have all the itens?
TearHeight, TearFallingSpeed and TearFallingAcceleration
I think it's actually 3 stats working together
I think all, but Range is a bit complicated
heared we couldn't change range or smthng
and which stats can we change atm?
? This guy ?
https://github.com/Kapiainen/The-Subliming-Of-Isaac
hm
Thanks robobaby <3
<@120355885615808512> Don't think so, but you can add cache="damage" to a passive item and set a flag internally so that you run code exactly once when it's picked up
who the hell uses vim anyways xD
<@126590786945941504> where did you get the auto fill plugin?
I wonder if there's a vim plugin, though.
is there a callback that is called on itempickup?
<@126590786945941504> thats true. i absoluetly fucking love that feature
should have listened to kube
http://i.imgur.com/afCEwMf.png
But can n++ do the subliming of isaac?
Its really good, I feel bad I didn't do it earlier
yeah, sublime is great too, but n++ will do the job ^^
XML is just text, yeah.
I recommend sublime too :P
Get Sublime text
you have to select XML under langauge
Get
i have notepad ++ here haha
with xml
I recommend vim. To no one. Ever.
or do you need special stuff?
it works?
oh
notepad ++
almost every editor <@132569939969179648>
Of course, forget Lua is like that
player.Damage = player.Damage + 0.5
Someone know a good xml editor?
Would that work?
player.damage + 0.5?
try just `player.Damage`
you want to do it through code right?
actually
cache flag in items.xml, MC_EVALUATE_CACHE
Browse the LuaDocs.
Surprisingly I haven't edited stats yet
but takes away the damage boost the first time you take damage
that fully refills red hearts, gives you double damage
Guys how do I edit Isaacs's damage stat
I was also thinking about a one time use spacebar item
been a while since I played isaac
Currently Money Is Power (or whatever it's called) gives you 0.04 damage per coin, which is capped and can be lost.
what??
30 rooms per floor???
assuming there's like 30 rooms per floor (there's less)
less than that
+0.05 to speed per room
I'd say even a less than 0.05
if it's per room
that'll still be op as hell
depends on the stat
+0.05 to speed?
like
not really, I'm thinking very small amounts
Fuck you robobaby
sjoe that's very op
GetNumEncounteredBosses()
It is gonna be utilizing this
Well
I was thinking about making an item that gives a small random stat up whenever you clear a room
or bosses in general
is it boss *rooms* encountered
1 damage?
actually
sounds a bit too low
that
I'm gonna make a passive item that adds +0.5 damage per boss you encounter
hi
Hello!
idk try it
would that work?
function ModName:blindUpdate()
  player= Isaac.GetPlayer()
  player.FireDelay=1 
ModName:AddModCallback(ModCallback.MC_POST_UPDATE,ModName.blindUpdate
because you're calling it each update
or `2` maybe
you should get away with just setting it to `1`
also

Pfsh.
`600`?
uh
>`10*60`
Not particularly. I was just curious about it.
with this below it
ModName:AddModCallback(ModCallback.MC_POST_UPDATE,ModName.blindUpdate)
Yeah, but... Is it important?
would this stop tears from firing?
...dude
That likely affected my results, though there was still a notice-able difference between Render and Update's rates.
will this ``GetNumEncounteredBosses()`` get the number of bosses encountered? Just checking
So keep that in mind
While update doesn't
Also, render runs when the game is paused
i n t e r p o l a t i o n
That makes sense. It draws more frames than it updates (I assume you have vsync off)
Definitely slower, <@110125570452398080>. Left is Render, right is Update
they should've either made enums for the special return values like `CallbackUseItem::Animate`/`CallbackUseItem::NoAnimate` or just had the user call `TakeDamage`/play the pickup animation/etc
<@267112861921181697> yes return(true) at the end of your useitem fuction
<@267112861921181697> i think he means use_mod(returm true)
I still don't get the EntityID parameter in the addCallback.. can someone help?
<@168775690152443925> ah ok that's good to know
smells like http://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession
tbh they shouldn't have just made it true or false
<@247117031575519232> itempools work if you only have one mod active
lilke return(true)
ok
at the end of the function
return true
fair enough, hopefully that gets fixed soon, would be awesome to find these mod items while doing a complete run without spawning them in ?
<@120355885615808512> how do I make my active item be help up when used
yes
ignored i think
Can i stuck isaac in using item stance just like red candle?
Hello again, so I've heard a lot of people talking about mod items not being allowed into itempools, but several of the mods I've downloaded have got itempools.xml in them... are those just ignored at the moment? Or is it worth adding one to my own mod in the hope that it'll work now/soon?
**advertising** just updated my mod if anyone wants to look at it http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323&searchtext=
It would be kinda weird for it to be otherwise since we don't get a deltatime in the callback
Well, there's an easy way to test it.
Right now my spacebar items are shitty cuz Isaac doesn't hold em up
i was gonna syay everything looked fine
I'm not entirely sure on that actually, but I assume its every game tick
haha
I'm an idiot, it's `content` not `contents`
Oh, I found out
*Is* MC_POST_UPDATE called every frame? I expected it'd be a little slower than MC_POST_RENDER.
How do I make Isaac animate holding up an item?
Yes, it's telling the game to call specific Lua functions when something happens, e.g. MC_POST_UPDATE is called every frame, MC_USE_ITEM is called when an item is used
Why does ```xml

Guys, anybody knows shit about challenges?
that I made on the minetest forums a year ago
I found a post
oh wow
I could make auto potion brewers
my only defining charactistic in factions
the AddCallBack function that is called at the end of every mod, what exactly is it doing? Is it telling the game the timing at which your custom function is called?
that was like
I used to be really good at redstone
I only remember one person's username
Last I checked, Minetest's mobs were absolute garbage. Is what really turned me away from it.
I once searched around and I think I found one of the people on Steam, tried adding to friends and they never accepted FeelsBadMan
i mean i feel like you could look them up by user name
kk
okay, Im about to ask a dumb question, but if someone answers it, it will help my understanding
feelsbadman.jpg
rip
like 3 days after
and the server shut down
rip
then another year or so later I went on again
\
Asked around and they weren't playing anymore I guess
Went on like a year or a few months later
One day I just stopped playing
Had two friends there
Oh man I remember playing on a server
The base game is kinda barebones but with mods it makes a decent enough game. I just like it because its easy to write mods for
it's a complete clone of the minecraft engine written in scratch with lua modding support
no
so8
no its minecraft but modded
force unlock?
might've changed since I last checked it out
called minetest_game or something like that
and it ships with a game based on that engine
oh
basically, Minetest is an engine
fully moddable
Yeah, Minetest 0.15 was released not too long ago
a clone of Minecraft written in C++ with Irrlicht
Whats Minetest?
Wait, is it still alive?
Minetest is great
Minetest has the best modding API. Almost the entire game, except for the engine, is a mod.
i don't remember
or just give
/give item Wooden_Sword for example
and not only items use it
and the whole game uses it
namespaces
except
think the current modded item system
*And you want to* ***RUIN*** *all that because you can't handle a* ***number*** *and a* ***function call?***
dynamically
it just generates them
Minecraft internally uses numeric IDs
also
putting commands in command blocks
<@126590786945941504> is that a copypasta
I remember being a feggit
*Compatible with pointers, if you will*
*The IDs are a simple and efficient system, that work well with arrays and enums*
what
because it defaults to `minecraft:`
You have found **2** item(s).
!items
you can do `give stone` too
all I know is that
note I don't play minecraft anymore so no idea if anything changed
*Directly correlated to and accessed by the C functions*
It took them years to do so, to be fair.
Minecraft switched to name IDs a while ago, now stuff looks like `give minecraft:stone`
*Intricately woven deep into the lowest levels of the engine*
what
like back in afterbirth
The ID changes as the amount of items changes
what
they should've moved to a name ID system
robobabs
tbh
for items
you can't get the ID directly even
kk
That's the right way
I put Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Itemname") instead of the ID directly
which has all the extensions of 5.1
<@110125570452398080> since LuaJIT is 5.1 compatible, you can just read the 5.1 manual and read this http://luajit.org/extensions.html
If I went to a programmer and touted HTML as experience, I'd expect to get laughed at.
btw i got the item to work
Language
Game Maker Studio
What's GMS?
But there isn't an official manual of LuaJIT(That I know of) so I use the Lua 5.1 manual
I feel like I'm close, everything works except the main menu graphics
and HTML
The best part of luajit apart from the speed is ffi
I know a bit of C#, JavaScript, GMS, and obviously learning Lua
Has anyone successfully added a character instead of replacing one?
and some 5.2 backports
Yeah I guess that's true.
LuaJIT is based off of Lua5.1
LuaJIT has complete 5.1 ABI compatibility
I know a bit of that
LuaJIT is 5.1 with a bunch of features backported, no?
Oh yeah
GMS is game maker studio programming language
one of the fastest dynamic language interpreters
It's not a standard melee weapon though, <@82714058339385344>.
love2d uses LuaJIT
<@110125570452398080> Love2d doesn't use lua 5.1
where are the crash logs?
Updated with synergies.
way before afterbirth+ released
Someone made a melee axe. It's on the Reddit
then stopped liking lua
I'm used to Love2d which uses Lua 5.1
I actually learned lua only for afterbirth+
oh woops
I started with this https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/
So the 5.3 manual is relevant here
Jeiionator, this is Lua 5.3
Actually
All you need is the manual http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/index.html#contents and the online book https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
Pfsh.
JSON?
But...
And CSS I'd, uh, understand
I don't know what's GMS
...what
I love this website for a quick overview of the language
the issue is remove collectible
i know a great deal of CSS(if that counts)
I can do some GMS and i know a bit of json
I figured out the problem line
https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
And if you have good experience
what programming experience do you have?
*Lua
Lua is one of the simplest languages to learn
lua is extremely simple
not specifically lua
i have programming experience
Anything that takes lua will be hard for someone that hasn't touched lua and doesn't have programming experience.
how hard would it be for someone who hasn't touched lua
Well, it shouldn't be hard to add that to it, I think.
gives luck up
so it like
to change the spear of destiny
how hard would it be
it has its own effects image
I don't think anyone's successfully made a melee knife-like weapon yet.
if i want to make an item like the spear of destiny, do i have to program it so it appears in the overworld when i have it?
it just said ``[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...``
Commenting out shit until it works
That's where I just checked
log file
You still can debug
theres no error
it crashed
Is that just an empty slot?
I cant debug
What is `COLLECTIBLE_059 = 59,`?
guys
um
Learn2Debug
did I do something wrong or..?
¯\_(?)_/¯
what the fuck
aaaaannnnddd it crashed
I don't understand, could you elaborate?
yeah that's a good point
etc
Hush, chest
well
Why not just make the item a passive and give you the golden items on pickup instead? I can imagine very few scenarios where someone wouldn't want to use it immediately.

Oh come on what the hell discord
member function
Oh come on what the hell discord
I mean, do call them methods for the sake of simplicity, but don't spread misinformation
I mean, do call them methods for the sake of simplicity, but don't spread misinformation
: is just syntactical sugar
Or `a.b(c)` if you wish
I consider any function that is called on its table a method
You can call them like `a.b(a)`
The thing is
They're still methods, even if the the definition is a bit looser in Lua
With that lag
hm for some reason i cannot use th e item
it'll say `attempt to call a nil value (method 'b')
`
Oh ffs discord
and `b` doesn't exist
Those are all functions
and `b` doesn't exist
Those are all functions
when you try to call `a:b()`
Fun fact
Actually
specifically those functions that are called through `:`
it has functions, but it calls some functions methods
Lua doesn't have methods like in other languages
All methods need the colon
Is there a way to know the `PillEffect` of the pill you're holding?
and std::vector is basically an automated array
All methods need the colon
I would assume so
or does that use a .
Does this work then? ``    player:AddGoldenBomb()
``
`a:b(c)` == `a.b(a, c)`
don't forget
Otherwise the first argument is the collectible instead of the player itself
it's a one dimensional array
<@228680372215349249> u wot
thank you
collectIBe
You need a `:` instead of a `.`
but I did
kek
Probably didn't have the collectibe
It didn't do anything tho
from the payer
that will remove the collectibe
<@267635009119191040> looks like an implementation of a vector container to me
definitely
``player.RemoveCollectibe(greedes)``
am I using this right
It could have been binded a little better though, give it a \_\_len and a \_\_index metamethod
to an array/list
it's an ugly interface
it doesn't
not so much the Lua
entitylist probably makes sense on the c++ end of things
I deleted it ;_;
NOOOOO
wait...
Ohh, I have the perfect thing for this occasion
you can always ?<@110125570452398080>
You can always `<@110125570452398080>`
that's great, haha
But hey
typing in `@jell` doesn't
typing in `@jeii` shows you
oh lmao I must have done that a long time ago
yup
...wait really?
hahah
not `ll`
it's `II`
oooh
why can I not mention you normally
also
<@110125570452398080> Get
Yeah `i=0`, I made a typo.
oh
why
EntityList doesn't implement __len
<@!194259969359478784> Won't work
Are you using `[]` or `.Get`?
wouldn't that be `for i=0,(entities.Size-1)`
try `for i=1,#entities do`
Weird, for me it fixed crashes. Oh well.
also
¯\_(?)_/¯
still crashed
Tried 0-indexing
<@267635009119191040> It crashes because it's zero-indexed (I think) so it doesn't work this way: `for i=1,entities.Size`, but works this way: `for i=0,(entities.Size-1)`.
someone wrote an EntityList class
~how could that be a mishap?
Or, as I said, advanced interaction which was undocumented which is a fuckup
Either bad design or mishap :P
when you're writing bindings
EntityList is bad design, still
And the Isaac method might just as well call GetEntities and convert it to a Lua table
The Isaac namespace is for functions that make things less verbose for commonly used functions, I assume.
it's literally an awkward interface to an array
Not sure if that's it, might be undocumented :P
that's it
a public Size member and a public Get method that takes in an id
you know what EntityList has?
with the isaac method too
As it looks like an interface to the actual C object
you can do that
uh
Like editting what entities are in a room, if that's possible
And the Room function is either a fuckup or for more advanced stuff
it isn't permanent iirc
They did say the `require` thing was probably not a permanent thing in their patch notes, didn't they?
Isaac method is for Convenience
and seems to crash anyway
which is akward to use
why does GetEntities returna n EntityList object
why does the Isaac method exist
Still
Yes, I was mistaken
It's a Room function
Game::GetRoom::GetEntities is not a Game function
In order to structure your mod in a way that makes *any sense whatsoever* it requires you to use table hackery
In order to structure your mod in a way that makes *any sense whatsoever* it requires you to use table hackery
*ahem*
fair enough
first one returns a table with entities
What are the exact two functions
<@126590786945941504> `Isaac::GetRoomEntities`, `Game::GetRoom::GetEntities`
I'm just not interested in bothering with installing it in Wine. My loss, I'm sure.
which since it runs at native speeds in wine isn't the highest of priorities
Fair enough.
they'd need to rewrite the injection for mac and linux
<@112975821186031616> Injection method
<@267635009119191040> Examples?
it's a dll injection
like getting entities in a room
What's stopping Antibirth from being native anyways?
why are some methods in `Isaac` and some with nearly identical names but doing something else in `Game`
Game class being a minor nuisance that's probably related to the way the game is structured internally
Game class being the prime example probably
lol
but it's still badly designed
And for development you can pass a flag to the executable
well when antibirth gets ab+ backported there won't be any separation
we'll see
Keyword being **currently**
and yeah that's correct, security issue
The alternative is segregating the modding community.
<@267635009119191040> That's currently missing because of security issues, no?
example mod
honestly i wish they made ab+ in lua
obviously C modules should not be requireable by default
How does one make something like Sharp Straw that charges based on time?
<@228680372215349249> Until you consider having to run every callback separately in a scripting language
they'd need to rewrite the entire lua api, though
no relative lua require from mod dir
Get the Antibirth dev team to work with Nicalis and boom, best expansionj
in main.lua
you have to put all your code
also
which makes no fucking sense from a performance standpoint
Honestly
it will have native performance on wine by definition
rebirth uses opengl dude
there's no individual scripting units for individual entities and items etc
Antibirth working with Edmund would be a perfect way to help shape the future of the modding API for the better.
Or not even an issue
Minor issue, you just save it in a variable
wine doesn't count. I can run damn near anything in wine
that you have to instance?
<@110125570452398080> antibirth runs in wine
why is `Game` a class?
Like there is shit missing, so that is a problem
everything is one blob
It's terribly designed
I find it quite intuitive
good thing though because the api has nothing
How is the API designed wrong?
And I don't mean missing stuff
Okay, all the missing features apart
yeah
What's designed wrong?
Oh, really?
Also the antibirth api does not appeal to me since I don't use windows
kilburn declined the tools
^
it's designed *completely wrong*
Didn't Edmund or whoever say they were going to work with Antibirth to implement it? Is that still a thing?
Why wouldn't there be a way to force unlocking items from Lua?
¯\_(?)_/¯
antibirth api
^
The AB+ modding API can only get better, and I really hope it does. It shows potential
etc etc etc
workarounds that won't work for long
Custom Achievments
wrokarounds
Not necessarily
until you get 100% in ab+
c u s t o m a c h i e v e m e n t s
^
having unlocks disabled makes it impossible to make a Big Mod a la Antibirth
done
I expect them to expand on the API. It's not perfect, but it's usable as it is. I'm not jumping on the AB+ hate bandwagon yet.
if you want achivements, play unmodded
Run one program, rename one folder
Dude
now you have to unpack game files and remove the packed ones
"large"
with a large workaround
<@126590786945941504> they're cracking down on those
rebirth-style mods work, don't they?
it should straight up never disable ingame achievements
^^
I mean
no
But honestly, if you care about achievements, why the hell are you playing modded?
I think it should be togglable by an obscure setting
\o/
it should be there
No shit
when you use a mod you have the "achievements diabled" thing that you have on challenges and seeds
that's retarded
or maybe not
no it's ingame completely
Not aware if there's a difference.
things like custom characters are gameplay affecting but don't activate any ingame unlockables, are those going to be locked too?
or is it just steam?
Pretty sure you can remove the active item
<@112975821186031616> But does that work with actives? actives technically are not collectibles
completely
because they're disabled
you can't even have your own achievements in mods right?
frankly at this point I'm more inclined to make my own roguelite
and ender idk i haven't used the antibirth api and don't plan to
it should at most hide steam achievements
There's a RemoveCollectible function, <@267112861921181697>.
Is that it disables all achievements
<@66197463593136128> they have said that they're going to enable achievements for mods that don't affect gameplay
The dumbest thing
things like new challenges disable unlocks which makes no sense
but ingame unlocks?
butt
non-progression achievements are one thing
HE HAS RETURNED
Can `spawn` in the debug console spawn things at certain coordinates?
ROBOBABY
like Pandoras box
but they're disabling it for everything
How do I make an active item that only works once then it is deleted
well i don't think it's very unreasonable either
it's a pretty common practice to interpolate that actually
I don't think it's unreasonable to want to disable achievements with mods active.
60 is 60
doesn't make a difference in the long run
Minecraft is 20tps
then again
but it's interpolated 60
well the game graphics are at 60
huh, not 60?
of course the docs won't tell you that ?
oke thanks
so update callback runs at 30fps
and yeah game logic runs at 30fps
if people want to cheat who cares
is the update callback called fixed 30 times a second?
it's a singleplayer game
yeah
but my point is it shouldn't be a workaround anyways
without disabling achievements
yeah i'm well aware of both of those
and there's a way to install lua mods
there are still workarounds for asset mods
apparently not
<@66197463593136128> fun fact
Does it matter what ID I set in my item's xml file? Can it just be any arbtitrary high number
<@134478547795443712> the whole thing where if you use any mods achievements are disabled
terrible excuse yeah
but still
achievement thing?
doesn't excuse everything
antibirth was going to have a lua api from the beginning anyways
¯\_(?)_/¯
also tyrone said that the plan was to release the api then update it as people made things
especially with the achievement thing
although you do have to admit this is a step back for modders in general
true
You're exaggerating
Eh
step back for isaac's reputation
step back for nicalis
a step back for modders
this is a step back for everyone
How could it not?
this is the worst of the worst case scenario
how could it have been worse
I'm saying it's not as bad as it could have been all things considered
so you're saying it's excusable because it's indie?
many AAA games have been a lot worse
so that he gets the money for the soundtrack back
how could it've been worse? it's worse than even i thought and i had zero expectations
for 5k or whatever it was
The expansions is not THAT bad
lol yeah
¯\_(?)_/¯
honestly kil should just sell them the api
It all could have been a looot worse
Honestly
they could've gotten him just for api
kil doesn't necessarily want to associate himself with nicalis after the shitty job they've done
well I mean
probably would be for the worst
<@66197463593136128> tbh why is kilburn not a nicalis employee yet
then you're not a true /r/unixporn user yet
because if i3
i3 or i3-gaps?
i'm on i3wm so i don't need .desktop files, i just need to throw it in ~/bin
and some funky icon different from the normal steam
for it
I should add a .desktop
I even have a `winesteam` script
running it through wine isn't even an inconvenience it's just "start up wine steam"
yup
so he knows what we want for the most part
is that Kilburn is a modder himself
<@66197463593136128> The thing that gives me hope
¯\_(?)_/¯
...but it took kilburn two weeks
it's about as good as ab+'s api on launch but with much better docs
but as in the restrictions are not the real restrictions
it's nowhere near complete
i don't know when antibirth api will release
not as in there are no restrictions
it's working with the illusions of restrictions
but this isn't just working with restrictions
I like working with restrictions
Eh, idk guys, I've had a lot of fun so far
haha
the only thing that makes me happy now is watching NL forget to go into the void entrance
the api is devouring my energy
isaac date*
and they test on windows like once a month and once quickly before release
nicalis still doesn't test on anything other than windows
captain's log, day 1938451385
I tried itempools.xml but it doesn't seem to work. There is also a Game:GetItemPool() function which seems to crash the game
captain's log, day 5: still cannot do the most basic thing with the API which everyone has always wanted to do
Anyone figure out how to add custom items to item pools yet?
gib
when will antibirth api go public
jer
¯\_(?)_/¯
antibirth api works in wine, i can say that much
hi
hi
Hi
? ? ?
firetear crashes on linux?
because those emails feed into a fax machine which prints into a shredder
I'll CC literally every single nicalis employee tbh
why dont you write it to their support email
eyy
2. write angry email to tyrone complaining about afterbirth+ and play isaac in wine for now until it's fixed
1. write angry email to tyrone complaining about afterbirth+ and wait until it's fixed
I have two options
wine's meant to get better as it ages
Period
FireTear crashes on Linux
wew lad
That's acutally a nice TIL
That's crazy, in 2018 wine will have existed for a quarter of a century
neat
since it began
~24 years
lol
haha
wine is older than most of the users on this discord
maybe ShowHallucination only works in the Void?
yeah
It runs windows programs
it's a compatibility layer for running windows programs on os x or linux
ok\
So
WINE = Wine Is Not an Emulator
Whats Wine?
I'll just try it in wine
actually, why reboot
they're even breaking things that worked huh
weird
hm
rebootin' time
<@124088844181045249> angel head crashes
just frames
Its the same, there isn't a second perameter now tho
because that's all it did before
did they completely change the function?
all it does is show the static that comes up when you're in the void
Ilse rose they changed the documentation, you don't use a backdrop anymore
Maybe it spreads
maybe this error you found is more pervasive than you thought woob
i actually used ShowHallucination() before but now it crashes me
interesting
Yeah
it's nicalis after all
unlikely to be a platform issue but ¯\_(?)_/¯
kek
and check if it still crashes
I'll boot into windows 8
if it still crashes
<@124088844181045249> I'll definitely try
4 out of the 5 items shoot tears
and still crashes
for the velocity
just tried (100,100)
see if anyone else's mod with firetear crashes isn't a bad idea yeah
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834783578
and checking it out
You can try downloading my mod
tried using higher velocities?
Windows
<@135254843567767552> How? I really wanted to us eit before
<@124088844181045249> unlikely to matter, but are you on windows, linux or mac?
that's not gonna do anything
doesnt really make sense but still
showhallucation also does work, though strangely
reevaalute steam cache, reinstall game. dunno
Idk then
<@267112861921181697> it works for <@124088844181045249>
like showhallucination
and no other mod was loaded
There are a few things that just don't work
```lua
RegisterMod("test", 1):AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, function()
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  player:FireTear(player.Position, Vector(0.1, 0.1), false, false, false)
end)
```
Maybe it just doesn't work?
your code seems absulutely fine
I tried loading a mod that's just this:
Yes
dunno
and it's not anything else, it's that for sure
woob, tried disabeling every other mod?
no matter what
EntityPlayer::FireTear crashes the game for me
Was eating lunch
Whats the issue?
how would I even debug this lol
Sorry haha
anyway back to FireTear
One for Insanity and one for puzzle cube
I did
with two different ids
in fact, you could probably use one function and add it two times
for organization
I am fine using more than one function
just add a new use_item callback with another id and a different function
OR
and then you have to check
which wall cause it to be called for every single active item
you can either not pass the item id
well, if you're using that
ah
just test for the item?
Use_(itemname)
in the same function
what do you mean cant have two actives
So can I just copy the function and it will work?
you can call AddCallback multiple times with the same callback type and a different function
and then add them separately
cant have two actives in the same function
but it'd be better to separate it into two functions
you can have two items in the same postupdate
what
Maybebecause you cant have two actives?
I dunno
why not?
What passive items should be easy to create, for practice? And can two items be in the same PostUpdate function?
yup
I'll DM you what I have already, is that ok?
<@146345870114160640> if you can make the sprites and animation I may be abel to do stuff for ya. Dependign on what it is
that's all the code
if the variable doesn't do anything it creashes
```lua
RegisterMod("test", 1):AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, function()
  player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  player:FireTear(player.Position, Vector(0.1, 0.1), false, false, false)
end)
```
with this mod:
it crashes
uh oh
102 messages in 20 mins
back
and run with only it enabled
that just runs firetear somewhere
I'll make a mod
better idea
well it'll stop crashing when I uncomment firetear
everything but the fire tear
unless the log has some weird buffering
Try commenting out parts of your code until it stops crashing
it'd print finished firing a lot
but no
maybe I'm spawning too many tears?
hmmm
the firetear line is the only relevant code, because that's what crashes and it's not my method/function
wanna show us the code woob?
ugh
no problems with firetear here
hmmm
putting the FireTear in post update crashes too
should I show the animation I did for it?
Would like a way to mod the mimic into the game, if that'd be possible
?
like setsprite(resources/stuff/things.png)
do i jusr rite down the path ?
well, basically I have an animation for when mimics turn INTO mimics when you get close
how do i define a sprite with the setsprite code ?
huh guys
<@146345870114160640> I don't think many people will be willing unless you actually show off what you have done and what you want
I already have the art assets completed, I just need a coder to help
with other parts
maybe the entity interacts somehow
but it prints about to fire
Yeah
it never prints finished firing
But I don't really have any clue
yo any talented coders in here willing to team up for smth
how
If you ask me I would say the error is somewhere else
no error either
and never prints finished firing
crashes
it prints about to fire
as you can guess
Don't see anything wrong there
hm
in lua
```lua
Isaac.DebugString("ABOUT TO FIRE!!!")
    player:FireTear(player.Position, Vector(0.1, 0.1), false, false, false)
    Isaac.DebugString("FINISHED FIRING")
```
```moon
Isaac.DebugString("ABOUT TO FIRE!!!")
player\FireTear player.Position, Vector(0.1, 0.1), false, false, false
Isaac.DebugString("FINISHED FIRING")
```
and you sure that's what is the source of the crash?
mind pasting your code?
right
It crashes
still crashes :/
or maybe the velocity is too high
I'm spawning the player tear at an entity's position, maybe that's the reason...
anyway
yup
Just felt like telling you because it took me a while to realize that
Figured out that pretty early ?
I know
FireDelay is the current fire delay and MaxFireDelay is the actual stat
yeah yeah
not FireDelay
you change MaxFireDelay
oh, right, of course
with `cache="firedelay"`
btw don't get fooled
yeah
into the game's items.xml
just look into other items
no
is it just cache? Not cacheflags?
is an example
`player:FireTear(playerPos, Vector(x*tearVelocity, y*tearVelocity), false, false, false)`
you set cache flags in items.xml by adding a `cache="FLAGS SEPARATED BY SPACES"` attribute
<@124088844181045249> could you paste the relevant lines of code you use to fire a tear?
ty
jkjk ? I'm done now lul
Every channel is my bitching channel
leenucks tho
Can you people get a personal bitching channel?
I, like Jer, am wait for antibirth api
wise man
I don't own ab+
I'm just here for general Lua help
uninstall ab+ and wait for antibirth api
How did you set cache flags for items?
i know a good workaround
Sorry I wouldn't know much about that
Anyway
I use FireTear from the player entity no problem
in yet another workaround
I'm just interested
k Mike Winderps
and not even the good kind like <:KeebFish:260781892880695296> does!
***so much dicksucking***
mike gets it
Cuz the api ***sucks dick***
Ooh ooh I know why!
has anybody managed to get it to work?
why does FireTear crash
ffs
yes
You could add an item room with your item on the pedestal as a fix to the itempool issue, right?
we cannot add any item/room spawn mechanics right?
that means i am progressing towards independence and I will then have no need to bother you!
I found my issue and fixed it!
Woo
Righto then.
yes serrix
Anyone know how to change the fire damage when adding fire to an enemy?
Ugh
I was opening a Boolean like a function
So just to confirm, most new item mods in workshop currently require you to just spawn in the new item yourself?
I found the issue
Line 62, where my error is, is this: ``Game():Darken(1.0, 120)``
yeah okay, sorry.
```
Jacquerel - Today at 12:15 PM
not without editing the base item pools, as far as we know
```
I mean like, is there a simple way to add my new item to the Treasure Room item pool?
not without editing the base item pools, as far as we know
So there's no way to add an item to an itempool right now?
does someone know how to use the animation editor on linux ?
I know the basics of using ends or {}, so why cant I figure this out? Does the callback need to be in a function or something?
probably
I think maybe you should watch a tutorial or two to learn some basic concepts before you start asking for too much help
Have you seen any of the API tutorials?
setting it to a high value every update cylce
i assume i have to paste the firedelay thing somewhere
sorry i know nothing about lula
what do you mean by that
making the player.FireDelay very high should worke
or look for a "blindfold" attribute ?
maybe firedelay = 999999 ?
so how do i make him not fire tears
apparently this makes the player not be able to deal damage at all, even with methods that aren't tears
Yeah, but checking the text edior dhows no ends missing
<@267112861921181697> probably missing a "end" or something like that
funky
disabling isaacs tears is what made the item not work
apparently
okay
because the editor doesn't see any extras
but what normally causes that issue? too many ends or too little ends?
I know what it means, obviously
What does that mean?
its saying <eof> expected near end
hm...
Ok thanks. I got a little worried there.
woag
yeah forever !
So if I just dismiss the message, can I continue using it?
Is it not possible to change fire damage?
and it ded
than i did the item name change
but the sprite change worked
try an editor with syntax highlighting, then its easier to see http://i.imgur.com/CihbNWS.png
so its basically just a reminder
and i changed its sprite
Oh
yes
right arrow, enter
me on the other hand, i can't even get character changes to work. is it players.xml ?
you get used to it
just its name and decs
but i didn't edit the item
it tells you that every 25 saves i believe ?
just got it
ah
Sublime 3
if the item doesn't work when you spawn it in regardless of your xml file then it's the item itself...
I saved and it said "You finished the triail, now buy the full version"
what do you use ?
i'm sorry sir but i'd like to see your notepad.exe license
Lmao
Why do I need a lisence to use a text editor? that's kind of bullshit
i changed its name and decs in items.xml if that helps
it still doesn't work
with commands
i removed isaac from starting with it and gave it to isaac
I think Spear of Destiny is one of those items that's kinda eeh
but it's not working
i start wuith it
the item appears
it works
(That's not a real question, I was asking myself)

it shows the item is there
But where?
figured.
you forgot a closing tag probably
changed charactes.xml
eof is end of file
end of file
What?
ender, that's what i did
What is <eof>? I found it in an error and have no idea wha tit means
is EntityCollisionClass broken? tears damage the same entities no matter what it is set to
Ugh
Oh
you could put 1000 in and it'd still do the characters current damage
your math isn't wrong, the game is just ignoring what you're putting there
Then y = x/4
Well x = damage
So damage = x(that's not the actual code)
I'm dividing the damage and it still just does the regular damage
I mean, what do you need to calculate
Code
In the cide
More specific?
everyone know math
Anyone know how to do math?
Just change characters.xml
Starting Items can easily be modded
i haven't actually messed with starting items so i'm not sure, i can mess around though
Sorry I didn't listen when I was told to get a new text editor, I will try to be a lot more cooperative and try to be kinder.
i also set isaacs tears to off if that helps
but the hud says its here
now the item is invisible and doesn't work
i made isaac start with an item and i changed its name and description
Anyone know how to do math in the code?
well
it depends on what it is sunx
god damn it
but it wont change it
damage works right with judas the damage changes
hm
illie, could you help me with something?
yeah, you can put anything into the damage parameter and it doesn't change, so i think it ignores whatever you're passing in
it just doesnt divide it
it gets the damage right
you may not be able to fix that until they update
it does seem to not care about what you put in for damage
ugh
ugh
no matter what i do it just damages worth your damage
new problem
ok
huh. even with 0 damage the fire still hurts. couldn't tell ya
so 3.5
its isaac base stats
your damage must be higher than or equal to 4
your fire damage is being divided to 0 mines not
thats what im confused about
it was just being divided to 0, it's working fine
i did
local x = player:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0).TearDamage
                    local y = math.floor(x/4)
                    entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, y)
for the fire part and it does damage
<@267635009119191040>
your fire damage is doing no damage? mine seems to do damage still
IT WORKS
hey, I downloaded the subliming of Isaac and put it in the right folder, but for some reason I cannot find "Package Settings" under preferences.
not even invisible, the game says its there but it doesn't work
probably since the default damage is 3.5 and it's being floored to 0 after dividing by 4
now it's disappeared
i changed an items name and description in items.xml
I changed playerNum to 0 and added .TearDamage to the end of local x = player:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0) and it's working fine, albeit the fire is dealing 0 damage
<@166249905772429312> what is it
does it cause burning? and the damage is scaled?
can someone help me with something
wait it works for you?
Shock, I copy pasted your code and it works even with two people, i'm not sure why you're getting that error
I subtracted the wrong vector from the wrong vector
oh god...
anyone know why it wont work?
ok I have no idea what's crashing
ugh
but i stil doesnt know how damagescale and teardisplacement works
should i try getting the weapon type?
are crashing
or maybe the entityflags
thats what the documentation says on it
maybe it's crashing when I try to set the collision class?...
EntityPlayer::GetTearHitParams    (    WeaponType     WeaponType,
float     DamageScale,
integer     TearDisplacement 
)
still shows 
[INFO] - [OrangeCandle] Error in PostUpdate call: .../Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/orangecandle/main.lua:21: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetTearHitParams')
https://github.com/Kapiainen/The-Subliming-Of-Isaac
error 404 obv
When I search for the Subliming of Isaac, the GitHub page is missing
nice
it must be crashing because of something completely different
it doesn't crash because of this at all
ooooooh
Oh, thanks.
Where can I find that?
google the subliming of isaac
ilise rose still doesnt work
which scrapes docs and makes completions
<@267112861921181697> you should get the plugin for ab+
in the Isaac.GetRoomEntities call
do I have to do anything to make it work comepletely with Lua?
it crashes
amazing
still doesnt work
I got sublime
but the internet goes down for half an hour
that feeling when you're about to tweet out your mod release
https://hastebin.com/itoceqesoz.lua
heres the entire code if needed
well if that's the case, maybe it's because you have ```local x = player:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0)
                    local y = math.floor(x/4)```

instead of ```local x = player:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0).TearDamage
                    local y = math.floor(x/4)```?
but when i try making it so instead of doing a set damage it does the players damage/4 it stops working
i can get it to do that fine
then it has a chance to burn enemies each loop
thats the first part of it
function OrangeCandle:onUpdate()
    --Beginnning of run initialization
    if Game():GetFrameCount() == 1 then
        OrangeCandle.HasOrangeCandle = false
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE, OrangeCandle.COLLECTIBLE_ORANGE_CANDLE, Vector(555, 400), Vector(0,0), nil)
    end
    
    --Orange Candle functionality
    for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
it works in singleplayer but i dont know if that affects anything
uh, i believe so?
because if not then you'll always end up with `player` being the co op baby
is inside the loop body?
the rest of the code
ah wait
just do `local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`
it triggers for each player(so co op) but thats only there because my first item was following a video tutorial
Just checking, is this the right page? http://www.sublimetext.com/3
Ok it's not working at all
Also gtg, cya
why would you do that
<@237683512944230401> what
AFAIK there's no difference between those two <@267112861921181697>, but `Isaac` doesn't require you to get a `Game()` object
so I used that for clarity
Good
for playerNum = 1, Game():GetNumPlayers() do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
If you want the player, shouldn't you use Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )? or is there a difference
the docs use that
no that's c++
Don't tell me the moonscript syntax is `::`
Game::GetPlayer returns an EntityPlayer...
hmmm
sorry I just woke up and have no idea what I am doing
With a **normal font** :>
text editor yeah
local player = Game():GetPlayer(playerNum)
this?
If so, Sublime Text
Sublime Text 3
kek
Do you mean text editor?
"program typing thing"
and solves a lot of bad design in lua
What lua program typing thing should I use? I learned that my currently one is terrible.
moonscript compiles to lua
Lua pls
<@237683512944230401> did you cast `player` to an EntityPlayer
^
in moonscript
I think its an "formal" font, so look there first
local x = player:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0)
                    local y = math.floor(x/4)
anyone know if theres anything wrong with this?
func! is the same as func()??
you don't want to know
my code still isnt working
wait wait
didnt work
what font is that?
such difference
http://i.imgur.com/REeFIe2.png
I mean compiled Lua from moonscript
Maybe it does something weird in there
Check the compiled moonscript code? ¯\_(?)_/¯
for no apparent reason
It still crashes
That's beside the point though
But hey, that's just my opinion! ¯\_(?)_/¯
ok
I mean, sure, all I'm going to say to that is `Fuck moonscript`
the error you're getting is saying GetTearHitParams is not a method on the player you're referencing, so you can either check to make sure it exists before calling it or not call it there
<@126590786945941504> `func!` is equal to `func()`
or whatever the term is XD
am i calling the damage correctly?
oh
im pretty sure my problem is calling the damage
Also, do you not need the `()` in there?
moonscript
because before it worked and that code was there
Why the `!`
what
i dont think thats the problem
`Isaac.GetRoomEntities!`
this code does it for isaac and co op babies i believe
<@126590786945941504> thanks, would not have guessed that myself http://i.imgur.com/kUkwoOI.png
kuberoot who are you talking to?
there could be something else wrong, but local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0) is what i've used
Just do `for k, v in pairs(entities) do`
with no erro rmessage
then crashes
it succeeds in getting the entities a bunch of times
if you meant i should change playernum to 0
wtf
that didnt work ilise rose
with no error message
nice crash
"Asnweed"
oh wait already asnweed sorry
it returns a table
that's good
table
oh
ah alright
<@267112861921181697> that tells me nothing about the return value
I probably made a million mistakes here
A table
``local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )``
Am i even close guys ? ```local SI = RegisterMod( "Champions",1);

function Entity.GetColor ( npc )
     
     if ( color(R) ) then
    SetSprite(resources/gfx/monsters/monster_alternatered.png)
     
end```
or an entitylist
is that a table?
You can use local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
Isaac.GetRoomEntities() is what I use
can anyone help me figure out a problem with item stats beingfucking bizzare
Ok I'll check that!
`Game():GetRoom():GetEntities()` in lua
is `Game!\GetRoom!\GetEntities!` the right way to get all entities in the current room?
hmmm
the enums dont seem to be correct
it has to be Size that crashes it because it should never call get
Had anyone else ever problems with GridEntityType?
<@237683512944230401> looks like you're trying to get player 1, not player  0
wait
actually
I like how calling Get on an EntityList freezes the game
Uh
Anyone know why it won't work?
Probably create aliases for your commands, but haven't tried it
what does the macro command do?
lol
lol
[INFO] - [OrangeCandle] Error in PostUpdate call: .../Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/orangecandle/main.lua:21: attempt to call a nil value (method 'GetTearHitParams')
i didnt see the error
i didnt see the error
crap
wait
yes
the item still spawns in the spawn right just fine
Not the console?
You're looking at log.txt, right?
and i know theres no problem with that part
it simply doesnt light enemies on fire
no
in the log
is there any error
what do you mean by not working
https://hastebin.com/itoceqesoz.lua
its still not working
nvm, there's no `math.round`
lol
i did
local y = math.floor(x/4)
I cant see anything so I don't know what he is saying
GMod has an added `round` function
I've lived a lie
Oh god
i think im doing it wrong
hold on
wait what
Or, wait
since when is that a thing?
Oh
`math.round(n)`
or just, y'konw
you can use `math.floor(n+0.5)`
Why are you repeating my messages
oh no discord
for a more common irl rounding method
You could also do `n-n%1` if you really wanted
Just don't give advice if you're not sure of your answer
I don't know why I bothered
do that then^
I cant comphrehend myelf
<@267112861921181697> that's what `math.floor` does lol
`math.floor(n)` rounds `n` to the biggest integer smaller than `n`
what
Do `math.floor(damage/4)`
if less than one, 0 and less than 2, 1, less than three. 2 etc.
?
dude
`math.floor(damage/4)`
nooo
Maybe do great than and less than if statements to convert it to the closest number
and how do i do that? sorry for the inexperience
uh
kae it so it always outputs a full number
how do i fix that?
your outputting floats somethimes if the damage is an odd number
...the hell
can anyone help me?
https://hastebin.com/sukarayasu.lua
its a problem with me dividing the damage by 4
hey, Would anyone bother with items if I made more revival items?
Or do you have to spawn a tear entity?
with FireProjectiles function?
<@132627275307810817> You can.
i dont know if they damage the player tho
<@132627275307810817> you can spawn tears
y = x/4
Now that there are more people, anynone knows if you can make an enemy fire tears? or is that bugged?
https://hastebin.com/sukarayasu.lua
anyone know why this wont work? it works when i dont use the player damage and just say x = 4 and y = 4/4 but when i try using player damage it spawns in but doesnt burn anything
anyone have any idea on my problem?
game sux
lame
There's no `io` or `os` :P
could read the user's options.ini file
https://hastebin.com/sukarayasu.lua
AFAIK no way to detect it
or is that just not implemented yet in ur mod
cant detect what the user's hud offset option is at?
My mod now on reddit https://redd.it/5mrf7v
and it does log the message
has anybody here changed the tear projectile into their own custom anm2? If so, any guide how to?
Ident it just entity:hurt()
it just takes the damage as usual
why doesnt this work?
`function Test:EntityDmg(npc,a,b,c,d)
    if shielding then
        shieldtime = maxtime - 1
        Isaac.DebugString("Damage shielded")
        return false
    end
end`
<@244660325905989632> You have to make a non-local veriable to keep track
if you're not good at coding already, you should honestly consider just waiting until there's documentation, because learning to code and having no docs at all at the same time is a huge obstacle
but it DID turn off tears
Thanks
Oh, ok !
it didn't change the starting item
the ID is filled in when you submit
it'll be autogenerated
okay the thign didn't work
start the game
<@81035468866584576> remove `metadata.xml`
so most likely no
Looks like it's calmed down a bit. So, just need a bit of a fix, and <@150336707609231362> knows the context too here. I still don't really know the syntax for cutting off the loop, since it endlessly spawns flies when I enter a new room.
Hey, how can i get an ID for my mod (to put in metadata ?)
i only know how to do like half the code.
or flock
but landwhales don't browse tumblr
before using it
do you even assign player
damn, im gone for 10 minutes and you guys are more triggered than a flock of landwhales on tumblr
it still didnt work portal-chan

lmao thats fine jean XD
<@267635009119191040> sent you a private message to explain
There are big arguments in here every day lol
portal-chan so how would I fix it?

**PEOPLE IN A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE, PM THEM AND START A GROUP CHAT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PING PEOPLE**
im still pretty new to modding XD
<@&206618799640674306> ***HELP***
im an egdelord because you get overly upset over being pinged? <@166249905772429312>
you will get notified
this is supposed to be a support channel
pinging is when you write someone's name with the @
if you're not in this channel
honestly i got the code from someone else(the part to get the damage stat) because i had no idea how to get stats. so how would I fix it?
I say
erm
<@166249905772429312>
that's all
the message will just highlight
wait a sec woob i'll pm you
you won't get notified
if you're looking at the channel
portal stop being a huge edgelord
<@166249905772429312> dude
if people stop throwing tantrums about being pinged of all things sure
So temporarily disable them, it's not hard
i don't want to disable notifications as a whole for this server because i don't want to miss when people ping me when i'm NOT in a conversation
what
Yo can we like, you know, not be dicks to everyone in here? Fucking hell this is like the only channel where some people seem to be complete aholes
<@!142309138645516288> Try recoloring the entity and replacing the spritesheet of the Sprite from `GetSprite()`
<@237683512944230401> EntityPlayer is class so use . not : ?
<@!142309138645516288> yes, and that's literally what doing what I said would achieve
it should be an instance of player
disable notifications on mentions
go to settings
no i am not sure about that portal-chan
<@267635009119191040> you don't understand... What i'm looking for is NOT to have the champions color. Instead of a red champion, i would like to make it appear not red, but with a special sprite
mate
"you dont get to dictate what other people do" other people should respect what other people want
SO this chat wont be able to help peopel for a while will it?
anyone know why that wont work?
<@237683512944230401> `EntityPlayer:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0)` you sure about this
<@128545421579517952> Return `false`
local x = EntityPlayer:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0)
                    local y = (x / 4)
                    entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, y)
thanks
you dont get to dictate what other people do
no thats a sensible response
<@128545421579517952> Return `false` in the callback.
>immature, boo fucking hoo you're literally crying about people pinging you what the fuck lmao
iv tried figuring out for myself but i still havent made it work >_<
<@166249905772429312> if you're looking at this conversation you don't get pinged
that's an immature response but okay
anyone knows how to cancel the damage on MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG?
lmao
You can disable pings for yourself. I will keep using them regardless
<@!142309138645516288> if SetColor isn't the modulate like I think it is, *and* loading a different animation doesn't reset the modulate, you could try using `EntityNPC::Morph(EntityType type, integer Variant, integer SubType, integer ChampionColorIdx)` and replicating the effect of that particular champion
yes, but pipe, it's someones own fault if they don't look at a conversation while in it
exactly
<@166249905772429312> Why are you getting pedantic about it, if I want someone to know I'm addressing them I'll ping them
and not notice
when you ping them, they get to see the little orange color
because they might not have the chat open
anyone have any idea why my code wont work?
why do you need to put the @
i mean it a big flux, might not read everything you know
yes 
but why not just write their name
just wanted to make sure the right person sees it
jesus fucking christ fine
SunX it's more clear to people that we are talking to them
but don't put the goddamn <@166249905772429312>
if you want people to know you're talking to them say their name
im doing this but it just stops working(still spawns the item)
can we NOT repeatedly ping people who are already in the conversation
get its colour
say something
so i can
local x = EntityPlayer:GetTearHitParams(0, 0, 0)
                    local y = (x / 4)
                    entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, y)
okay can we stop for a second
but how would i get different champions, that's anotjer story
it does
oh hey!
i just tried it
im hvaing a problem getting the damage stat and diviging it
oh hi <@237683512944230401> !
<@166249905772429312> umm that should work
ok so something like if EntityNPC:IsChampion then
what do you need
so i did it to isaac
can anyone help me?
Oh nice
i was changing his starting item and noticed that with lilith
^
morning
<@!142309138645516288> It should be EntityNPC:IsChampion?

'morning everyone
some clyde bot said something
wait can people say what i said
how did you do it?
<@70946604139425792> hum... What's the function ? do you know it ?
<@150336707609231362> i figured out how to make isaac not fire tears
What do you need
can i have some help
^
he's not worth it
nah
we need a #drama channel i guess
<@162156525337575425> Kind of proves my point lol
right you two are making this place incredibly tedious to be communicating in. I'll be back later.
then set the color which I assume is modulate
why
>pinging people already in the conversation
There's a function which tracks if an NPC is a champion or not, so *technically* it's possible, but I can't think of any way to do it that wouldn't be hackish since I can't find anything related to editing preexisting champions
older than someone insecure about their age like you
portal how old are you x2
lol
>woob >read
no <@267635009119191040> it's not what i'm looking for
woob actually read what he's saying
if just changing the sprite doesn't work
entity:GetSprite():Load(new_anm2_file, true)
***__`SetColor`__***
what i was wondering is that: wouuld it be possible not to make them colored in the game
yeah. you'd have to detect that the entity is a champion, detect the entity to  see what enemy, then assine it a new sprite
But you can change sprites from Lua AFAIK
yes they are colored in the game
that would make him start with items with ids 105 and 400
`SetColor`
seems right to me <@166249905772429312>
im fairly certain the champions are colored in game and there are no different sprites for them?
it's just aplying the color over the existstent sprite
did i do it right
yeah but the recolor is not a sprite
Like if i wan't the red champion spider not to be red but to have a different png
Most likely, I think we have the ability to change sprites
do you think it would be possible to make different skins for champions ?
whats your mod
before i actually make it
that it's possible
but i better be sure
portal how old are you
sup
i wanna make a mod
hey guys
i singlehandedly ruined this api
idk how ill live this down
i deeply apologize
its my fault
im a fuckwad for not personally emailing tyrone himself flot
"Nicalis did X awful thing, Y awful thing, and Z awful thing BUT"
It sounds like you're trying to defend them
Fucking hell dude, I'm talking shit on Nicalis right now
And people still aren't sure how shit works in its entirety
they probably asked and everyone gave up after seeing the documentation
like way before
The first 2-3 days of AB+'s release were almost entirely spent figuring out how shit works because Nicalis wrote virtually nothing on the subject
before release
<@166249905772429312> you would need to take a look at players.xml
Tyrone was asking modders to contact him
I mean
I don't mean that
what
"Test the API" =/= "write our documentation for us lol"
actually the initial discount price doesnt count because the full price is still 9.99
to test the api?
didn't they ask modders with lua experience
actually 7.12 with tax?
one thing I was wondering though
can someone tell me how to change isaacs starting item
That is all on Nicalis
6.69
in the current state
argument ended
Near unusable
And what matters is that it should never have been broken in the first place
tl;dr: nine ninety nine us dollars
It's unfinished
Yes it's broken
What matters is that it's broken now
<@267635009119191040> What kind of stupid argument is that, I can't go into next week to enjoy a maybe-fixed API
sorry its up to me to email tyrone himself, thats the only way this is getting fixed
is this a stealth bot
Maybe just wait ? They surely have a ton of shit to work on actually
!modcall
I look forward to Ed confidently saying that everything will be fixed, when it reality they're putting old bandaids over gaping festering wounds
for the next update
that they haven't already fixed it
how do you know
portal calm down the edge
Edmund said that a new update will come next week
it keeps popping up
now shut the fuck up
can we get another channel for this debate
even though i shouldnt in the first fucking place, but i did just because im that nice
lol
i did precisely that
this is what they tell to people
http://i.imgur.com/c4dNTRk.png
"It's not THEIR fault they're not responding to major issues being reported to the support email they told everyone to report to!!!!"
you could also tweet at him
you idiot, mere minutes ago I told you that I can tell you the address to Tyrone
isaac@nicalis.com is a support email fuckface, are you going to defend them not reading support emails now
lol fuck off
Nicalis released an unfinished API
oh so i need to personally hunt down tyrones email to report something?
Flotlilla I'm not pushing the blame on anyone
email tyrone
do you honestly think they are gonna read every single email on the dumpster address for all things isaac?
Stop pushing the blame on the modders lol
The issue's already been reported for fucking days, and more importantly nicalis should have noticed it for the whole year they had in advance to fix it
and i already did, what the fuck is your problem
inb4 i did
and you should report the issue if you want to see it fixed
<@162156525337575425> yes they should've
they should've tried making "a whole new game" with the api
You have to download it from antibirth.com
or can I just steam workshop it
do I have to do third party things to get it to work
like they claimed they did
maybe they shouldve idk actually make something with the api before releasing it
You should, it's a nice mod
ew the name!!
I haven't played the mod
I'm fairly sure
I mean they didn't realize the player stat issue until Zamiell made the video lol
the name
oh
not the mod
lol
I'm just saying, if you want to have something fixed, then bother trying to make sure they even realize the issue
Uh
also, ew. antibirth.
antibirth is ?
afterbirth
does ab stand for afterbirth or antibirth
at the curret state it's near unusable
the API is unfinished
I'm not
What is it with AB+ apologists and getting personally insulted when someone insults the API for being unfinished lmao
im sorry ?
I don't care about your senses
its my fault the api is missing basic features
no guys dw
I'm sensing some hostilities
Wow Woob calm down
to their email for bug reports
i already did
report the issue
Then stop critiquing it fuckwad
well, havent seen your option work yet
emailed nicalis in general
gotcha
You already did!
im not emailing tyrone "antibirth can be ported to ab+" rodriguez
<@128545421579517952> That really should not be encouraged at all, people should be yelling at nicalis (at isaac@nicalis.com and their twitters) to fix the fucking item pools
but it's really easy to guess
The Nicalis one, not a private one
If you want I can message you Tyrone's email
lol
like the guillotine
you should lose half a heart and become headless for the room
if it hits you on the way back

Who said My Reflection was bad? ?
trudat
Well, if not it just means more time for me to learn Lua and to polish my sprite, that's no problem ?
randomly put your item in there
yeah, whenever a pedestal is spawned
and then hack an item replace
can't wait for someone to ask tyrone on twitter about it and his response is "just spawn the item through console on Basement 1, here's a tutorial for doing that"
mmm you could probably hook in to when a treasure room is entered
hacky ass ways of replacing an item maybe?
without using item pools
im pretty sure there are still ways of implementing your item on the game
after fixing their code ofc
Like any other item
You can only spawn in their example items with console
didnt even work without being modified
They still ARE
lol their example mods were broken
I saw that on twitter some days ago
Try emailing tyrone directly?
pretty sure they'd be obligated to follow any instructions received by carrier pigeon
Did they not made a bunch of mods already to show some example ?
isaac@nicalis.com
^
send them a carrier pigeon
what email address
about item pools being missing
what email
they ignored it
i already emailed nicalis
whatever you think is missing
i mean if they made even a single mod in it they would've been able to tell that its missing
alternatively email Tyrone
Tweet to tyrone and edmund
Also
Which is why you don't understand how easy it is to miss "basic things" like that
with inserting an API in a game that doesn't have one
It is, and you still have no idea/experience
a while ago
pretty sure they explicitly stated they weren't even shipping modding tools with initial release
its ridiculously basic
that already exists
Yep, but is that not a "basic function" ?
in a game
How hard it is to make a fucntioning API
this is such a basic feature dont even try defending this lmao
You people have no idea
^
give it time
i mean, its barely been out for a week
bugfix inc
Shit.
currently.
you cant add custom items to item pools
and yes you got that right
you need this in the xml tho
Wait, so, if you create a custom item, you can't add it to any pool ?
Isaac.GetItemIdByName?
i mean even if there is, nicalis hasnt told us about it
Is there a way to add an item to the itempool based on item name?
theres no way to get ids of your custom items for the itempools thing anyways
Even if it is
The thing is
That sucks
Damn
itempools.xml just isn't being read properly right?
the item pools editor is literally worthless
At least not AFAIK
An AB+ mod
It doesn't generate files you can put into a mod
The tool to modify itempools is not working ?
without that whats the point
tbh i wouldve made something like this if not for the fact that you cant even add items to itempools
I think you've fully automated shitposting
producing ideas
i mean, i could hook up a few monkeys to a server
You mean neural network **network**, amirite?
Just asking, i have nothing against learning Lua (wich i'm doing right now) be it could be very useful as i just want to create a bunch of item with "basic" functions. I already have all the sprite, stats, etc ^^
Neural network?
make it automatically recolor items and you've pretty much got yourself a nicalis-grade item maker
still accepted
oh, and the gui also has to come up with the ideas itself with a neural network
challenge accepted
lol
Is there a tool out there to generate items with some gui ?
when mono is cross platform
not much point of running a c# program with windows version of mono
not really file system, but file structure
i don't have much experience with wine/mono, but would the Animation editor work ?
because wine uses its own file system and such
i would still prefer mono
Yeah, mono
almost anything winforms will run with mono
Almost anything winforms will run with wine
just watch nicalis spending more time trying to disable achievements rather than improving this lackluster api lmao
Unless the game doesn't run callbacks anyways
havent tried tho
<@229593818691928067> probably, with mono
<@162156525337575425> ?
¯\_(?)_/¯
And have achieves with mods
If it does, you could edit that
<@128545421579517952> does it work on linux ?
Does `main.lua` run when mods are disabled?
everyone likes colrs
I mean
and colors
what, did someone find a way to make it work with lua mods too?
Filter between info, error and debugging messages
Add custom filters
No problem with multiple items in one mod, just make sure you don't overwrite your own functions
And yet another time I'll repeat, just load the file in your favorite **proper** text editor and it should update in realtime
You can do multiple in one mod.
heh
If i want to add multiple items in one mod, is that possible or i need to create a mod for each items ?
<@162156525337575425> >doesnt work with lua mods
but this one is k00l
Yet another realtime log viewer?
Hey !
just leaving this here https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mmr30/
Sprite has a Reload()
all of them?
Is there a way to reload the animations/sprites while the game is running ?
sounds cool
<@134478547795443712> i would actually download that
To put it on steam
I'm making a youtube vid this time
I'm gonna release my new mod after I prepare all the things
Just released my new mod
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mr89z/new_mod_cursed_heart/
oh man this plugin is real neat
ok
doesnt work with lua mods
check pinned messages in <#264851654627688450>
is there anyway to mod after+ but still have achievements? <:salt:259939505778327552>
But it works and spares me going through enums.lua for the simple stuff
Could be better, it puts weird stuff on autocomplete
Yeah, that plugin's good
<@128874748041101312> thanks ?
thanks
found
https://github.com/Kapiainen/The-Subliming-Of-Isaac
i want that plugin :3
hi <@267635009119191040>
<@267635009119191040> send link
anyone know how i can tell if the brimstone that is passed as the source in an entity damage callback is the players / friendly? source.IsFriendly is false, source.Entity.Parent and .Child are nil
if i were to add a enemy varaint i'd just give it an unused variant number in the entities.xml file, right?
i use sublimetext already for html/css/php
thanks <@267635009119191040>
yes you've said that already
eh don't really like notepad ++
like `mc_post_update<ENTER>` and you get`ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE`
and gives you completions
that scrapes the afterbirth+ docs
eh don't really like notepad ++
there's a plugin
<@149571507851362304> Sublime Text 3
does anyone know if it's possible to make an entity get hurt by other entities' projectiles, explosions etc?
notepad++
which program do you use to write the code?
for tears
not sure if entity.TargetPosition has any other effect
yes
entity.Velocity probably
Does anybody know how to manipulate the direction of a tear?
oh ok
<@174505132292046849> that's how it is in the files
just use `tail -f log.txt` tbh
why is version = 5?
thanks, I'll compare. I've probably just missed something ?
the above loads fine for me as a second entities2
```<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
    <entity anm2path="002.033_Rock Tear.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="8" collisionRadius="8" friction="1" id="2" name="Rock Tear" numGridCollisionPoints="8" shadowSize="8" stageHP="0" variant="33">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />
    </entity>
</entities>```
but this one has some more features
pinned messages
Dunno if this could be of  help to anybody, but here it is https://github.com/espilioto/Isaac-Afterbirth-log-viewer
I'm having a go at making a variant entity. Tried putting it in a new entities2.xml the same way I did with items.xml and put it in a content folder, but the game now crashes on startup. Am I supposed to put it in a different place? Or does anyone know if the game doesn't like a 2nd entities2 file, it seems to accept the 2nd items.xml fine.
Because we cant do some things that i would like to do
s
I hope they add some thing
I dont know if FIreProjectiles is bugged aswell
Edmund say a fix for FireBossProjectiles is coming tomorrow
I haven't tried much, all I know is that it either errors or crashes every time ¯\_(?)_/¯
<@126590786945941504> were you finally able to make :FireProjectile thing work?
¯\_(?)_/¯
I don't have twitter
`json` is nil
if not then tweet to tyrone I guess
is json not already loaded?
Time for homebrew serialization
Oh well
without luadebug; I think so
No more json?
sooo
since last update
yes
`require` is disabled now?
wait
Toph Beifong
Perhaps
<@126590786945941504> modification time maybe?
I kinda half-assedly tried to create a "sound ghost" NPC to play sounds but couldn't get it to work
But `stonebomb` loads after `kubetest`
so maybe it's the other way around
`kubetest` loads before `extraconsumables`
Ah
The other way around
I mean
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
yeah?
<@126590786945941504> um
but the only one I could find is in EntityNPC...
I'd expect a function like that in Game or Isaac
¯\_(?)_/¯
Is spawning an EntityNPC really the only way to play sounds?
Another question
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/818097007457771520
`extraconsumables` appears to load before `kubetest` for me ¯\_(?)_/¯
Except
`0_stuff`
so you could name it like
http://i.imgur.com/GtZkrnN.png
I've been wondering about that, good to know
it's probably alphabetical
That adds a function that can log stuff to the screen
after all mods are loaded
MC_MODS_READY
I do have one utility mod
something like
and have a callback
<@!120669965236830208> Yes, but you can't set load order AFAIK
<@126590786945941504> yup
Which is the same
That is, something like _G.shared
So we could make a "library" mod of common useful functions?
A good option would be having a single table shared between all envs
Well, just having the env shared with no protection is terrible
which is terrible
The global env is shared
yes
Is cross mod function calling a thing?
Because that triggers on continue
use post player init
why not
<@126590786945941504> uh
*if
and i i wanted to add a new enemy variant but with a different AI?
Should work when called in POST_UPDATE
```lua
local function isNewGame()
    local level = game:GetLevel()
    return game:GetVictoryLap() == 0 and level:GetCurrentRoomIndex() == level:GetStartingRoomIndex() and level:GetCurrentRoom():IsFirstVisit() and level.EnterDoor == -1
end```
I think I found the mix
ah ok thanks, I'll give that a try later ?
Just make sure to give it a different variant
<@247117031575519232> Dont quote me on this, but I think that if you give a new entity the same id as an existing one, they use the same AI
including collision checking
every single source of damage
For future reference, if I were to create a new entity, is there an easy way to ensure it has the same behaviour as an exisitng enemy, without writing it all from scratch. I'm not sure where in the entities list it specifies which entities have what enemy behaviours etc
I think I'll have to reimplement
ugh
thanks, I'll try that first then. Rookie mistake, but I might have found that earlier if I'd remembered to not put a u in colour when I was searching the documentation. woops ?
right, Entity::SetColor (Color Color, integer Duration, integer Priority, boolean Fadeout, boolean Share)
SetColor
also it might be possible to progamatically change the tint on the class Entity
otherwise you could create a new entity for the Pooter and you'd change the tint in the .anm2
the easiest might be to spawn them as a champion (you can choose which)
Hi nick ! there's several ways you could do this
Hello ? I only started modding yesterday, so I am pretty new but I was wondering if anyone could help me with a problem I am having. I've made an item that spawns pooters, but I want them to be a different colour to regular pooters. Originally I just copied the sprite sheet over and changed that, but soon realised that changed the colour of "wild" pooters as well. I also tried looking at the anm2 editor, changing the tint/offset values seems to work but again, changes it for every pooter. Is there a way I can tint them as I spawn them? I saw SpriteOffset was mentioned in the documentation but I am not sure how to use it/if it's what I need. ?
do I really have to reimplement all that myself
how would I make it so that my entity gets hurt by explosions/other enemies' bullets/contact damage
anyway back to my question
hopefully
Thats assuming that their sandboxing extends to files loaded using `dofile`, of course
<@267156751936126977> actually, I think you're right
isnt "require" still available somewhere in DebugMode ?
Theres nothing you can do with `dofile` that you cant just do by writing it in the same file, right?
To be fair, `dofile` isnt really a security vulnerability
It might not actually work
<@126590786945941504> yes
holy shit
which
but didn't remove dofile
Is this just a recursive _G scan?
they removed `require` and `package`
Whats `dofile` doing there
I thought they fixed the sandboxing issues
idk
this might be a little out of date
uh
indented
https://hastebin.com/enacivobil.txt

https://hastebin.com/lazivehadi.txt
in other news
is it possible to make an entity able to be hurt by other entities' bullets, contact damage or explosions?
just joking
break api?
I'm taking a beak if you will find a way to break api pin it, see ya leater
it's in CppContainer
ooooh
it's userdata
ok it's neither
or is it userdata with a pairs metamethod?
Is EntityList just a table of entities?
oh
what
where is that
~ <@135254843567767552>
```
as for the Config itemspace, it's not properly implemented based on teh documentation,there's a global called ItemConfig that has a Config on it
the metatable has all those Config things we want to access but they don't work or at least i haven't figured out how to make them work
so ItemConfig.Config.__class is where all those GetCollectible, GetCollectibles, etc things are
```
<@267635009119191040> Doesn't it reload assets when you disable and enable back any mod?
anyone complained about that to edmund / tyrone  already ?
fuck man ?
Config doesn't even exist
by assets I mean files in `content` and `resources`
without restarting
is there a way to reload assets?
<@!95444500364660736>  thank you! It works now!
so the whole class is not useable ??
Config isn't valid
<@128874748041101312> how did you accessed itemConfig ? i cant even get Config().GetCollectible() to run :/
previously you had to use a module such as bitop made by the author of LuaJIT
bitwise operators have been added in Lua 5.3
uhhh, there is bitwise or  in lua? didnt know that! cool
I'll try that right now
thank you
oh
<@126369664170328064> Example: `DamageFlag.DAMAGE_EXPLOSION|DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS`.
doesn't work
indeed
ok so everything in ItemConfig is just empty
i'll try  again, but I think it didn't
that didnt work? weird
as in  
`DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS+DAMAGE_POOP`
I treid adding before
sadly i dont have an example
Finnally
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837838037
try just adding them
can you show an example?
how?
I think
oh
<@126369664170328064> DamageFlags are bit flags, you can "combine" them
```lua
[INFO] - Lua Debug: __index
[INFO] - Lua Debug: PillEffect
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Costume
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Item
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Card
[INFO] - Lua Debug: __newindex
[INFO] - Lua Debug: Config
[INFO] - Lua Debug: __propset
[INFO] - Lua Debug: __propget```
huh
so ItemConfig.Config.__class is where all those GetCollectible, GetCollectibles, etc things are
the metatable has all those Config things we want to access but they don't work or at least i haven't figured out how to make them work
yes
on room
<@109624258317033472> do you mean getspawnseed?
as for the Config itemspace, it's not properly implemented based on teh documentation,there's a global called ItemConfig that has a Config on it
huh
at least when comparing player and enemies, i was index 0 at the same time a spider sac was and it was causing issues in my code
I want to deal the damage just like IV bag: even when invincible, and prioritizing red hearts
doesn't look like you can
comparing index has issues
<@128874748041101312> i know sth. never tried it tho. You can get an config item from an temporary effect which you get over player:getEffects()
`local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:TakeDamage(2, 1<<5, EntityRef(player), 0)`
Yep
ok so the Config namespace is nil apparently
<@126369664170328064> yeah, would be easier
ok thank you ill try
compare their entityindex
<@128874748041101312> really? thats bad, any workaround for that? o.o
you have to compare their index i believe
In lua I dont think == works for any type of table
<@109624258317033472> for some odd reason, you can't compare entityrefs or entities
do you want an example, to save time?
lemme look
how do I do it?
it works fine, but I need to add more than one damage flag
I want to use the function  player:TakeDamage
can someone help me with a thing?
^^
thanks
Oh I was actually going to ask that soon
ok ty
and if that changes, he entered a new room
Welp if i dont spawn my item i cant spawn it using console
<@258285593224544256> there is non. You can check for room:GetSeed
like what is the callback for that
how can you detect if isaac enters another room
npc comes from NPC_UPDATE callback
does anyone know why this doesnt work?: ?            
```entityRed =     Isaac.Spawn(ghostEntity,0,0,room:GetGridPosition(208),Vector(0,0),player)    
.
.
.
--Always returns false
if npc.EntityRef == entityRed then```
I found a method called GetItemPool
oh shit
I'll test
<@128874748041101312> tell me more about that config class. i want  to play with it but i cant get it to be recognised ?
as a final api this would be unacceptable
as people made stuff
it's good that they said the plan was to update the api
:c
Why not item maker
Good morning everyone
Man, there is a room maker
oh lol AddNullCostume is the `for Lua` one
there's a class called Config inside the Config namespace
but he's saying that it's not even recognized as a global
or `Config::NullItemID`
Config is a namespace
EntityPlayer has methods that take a `Config::Item`
Someone know how to create itens?
hmmm
weird
Config is unrecognized as a global and I can't find anywhere where it's already instantiated
except there's no way of getting to it that I could find
There's a Config class that has a GetCollectible method, takes the item ID and returns an Item instance
You can only get the item IDs
<@!120669965236830208> really? I vaguely remember a method to get all collectibles
please don't tell me they missed that too
argh, can't figure out how to fire tears that can hurt the player
The fact that you can't access that information through the API is ridiculous...
Brutal
i wrote them by hand
Did you do it by hand or write a script to scrape the information from the XML?
Yeah I bet
thank you ? was a lot of work
<@!174193097285173250> Good job tho, that's awesome and really useful
That's actually the first mod I wanted to make but couldn't figure out how to access item metadata through the API
but you actually rewrote all the item info in the lua file lol
I was gonna ask how you got access to the Config class to do that
Wow
Sad that mom's knife run are with no achievements
Works perfectly fine for me
I dont know man haha
<@132569939969179648> thank you for testing ? ... im happy that it works like intended. but why the fuck do people complain that its not working :/
Its working

Anyone know how to make a laser persist between rooms like Mega Blast?
I'm launching the game
Ok!
Classic "Its working for me" :V
just subscribe to "external item descriptions" and see if its installed for you and works for a test item
Test in game?
anyone here that can test out my mod ? some people complain in the comment section that its not working :/
lmao
one of the comments in the ab+ doc literally says "for Lua" and nothing else
Then set thumbnail and reupload
I allready uploaded it tho
No idea how to do it in steam
<@220525353830055936> I know you can set it with that button in the mod uploader
BTW, has anybody figured out how to detect when a new run starts?
How to set thumbnail in workshop?

woah guys any news on the ab api?
only beta testers have access
no
kilburn made the api public?
its made in the antibirth api
no
that's just asking for trouble
<@128874748041101312> is that made in afterbirth+?
I feel like it's just a minor annoyance
I think the fault is on the user: shouldn't have opened a modding tool
Sure, but is that enough to call it broken?
^
to make it spam
it's definitely poor error handling
and fixing the error will make it *not* pop up once every second because there's no error?
that that could be the nature of that particular error
you realize
yeah but
spawn 5.100.ITEMID
? winter-chan ? - Today at 12:31 PM
the problem is that the error popped up once every second
How do i spawn item pedestal via console?
didn't look up the error?
if you
how do you know it's not the problem
the problem is that the error popped up once every second
it could be a solution though

has there been news on the antibirth api
tbh https://youtu.be/pG_CMbw8_Nc
then it'll be a better modding API
and it's better
if antibirth gets a modding API
I think you're kind of missing the point that afterbirth+ has a modding API while antibirth doesn't
when did shilling become such a popular word
hmm
Thought it was fairly obvious
*i* dont have cool mods?
Shitting on you as a joke :P
is this antibirth shilling that I see?
also what does `I see somebody's salty they don't have cool mods :>` mean
Sorry
Oh, wait, not that kind of effects
You need help with effects?
That's okay ^^
sorry mate
not talk about if it's better or not
mmm I haven't worked with effects yet <@255386131955187714>
You could instead practice Lua, figure out how the game works, etc
And mod the game
We are here to help eachother
This is the modding channel
what does not bitching about it help
What does bitching about it help?
instead of them spending a year on it
because it took 2 weeks and is better documented than ab+?
You can say it's better when the API is actually released and documented
Yet you come here over and over and complain about how AntiBirth is better
The API is WIP and people are making stuff
"But-but... The game you're making it in is totally shit!"
You're acting like a 13yo who saw somebody make something cool
<@126590786945941504> what
Can someone help me with my code, ```playerEffects:AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_IPECAC, true)``` This should add ipecac effect to tears right? It's just adding the costume for me ?

dang.
<@116386733905412105> No it's a custom entity with a custom sprite
I was thinking you are making over 100 kinds of consumables

How do i ship my mod to workshop?
angra is it a tear variant?
Yeah API is terrible
I rewrote most of it today
has anyone managed to make a new character yet?
Most of the work has been figuring out the API
AB+
Since day 2 of Isaac I think
Yeah
For how long it is in development
good luck!
Okay, thank you <@116386733905412105>  I shall try it out.
You mean how long it took to code?
<@220525353830055936> Yeah, although the sprites were made by <@!188945290923868161> and <@164178433453064192>
which will require use of the anm2 animation editor in the modding tools folder of your steam installation
<costumes anm2root="gfx/characters/">
    <costume anm2path="Character_016_TophHead.anm2" id="41" priority="99" type="none" />
</costumes>
you'll need to give it the right costume too
<@!120669965236830208> You solo code that mod? How long in dev?
Then just replace the art directory to be my own made pngs?
Other than that amazing piece of work
also how do I do code tags
add something like this to players.xml:
<players bigportraitroot="gfx/ui/stage/" nameimageroot="gfx/ui/boss/" portraitroot="gfx/ui/boss/" root="gfx/characters/costumes/">
    <player bigportrait="PlayerPortraitBig_16_Toph.png" costume="41" hp="6" items="511" name="Toph" id="16" nameimage="PlayerName_16_Toph.png" portrait="PlayerPortrait_16_Toph.png" skin="Character_016_Toph.png" skinColor="-1" />
</players>
Like end of it is burried in ground/wall
Make costume sprite for when it lands afret throw
hi droid
For testing purposes right now. Probably an acidic tear synergy in the future
Hey I am new and I am sure this has been asked a million times but I have been searching and have found nothing. How do you create a new character, I heard people have got close to doing it. I haev all the art done for it.
Why its breaking stones tho?
https://streamable.com/q37hm
If anyone's curious about progress on the axe
Lost Contact Tear = shielded tears?
yeah thats why im asking if anyones figured out how to add them
but that was a day or two ago
and everybody just had it invisible
I saw a reddit thread about it
it would be weird to have custom char support without menu icons
in one of the gifs tyrone showed us it had menu icons
but you can stil lselect them as normal
their slot is just empty in the character select
but I have a custom character working
I don't think you can add menu icons
has anyone figured out how to make custom characters and add menu icons to them
its still there
yup
i will check give me a sec
if you resize your game window
does it still occur
then tail woudl be borkd
¯\_(?)_/¯
And the bobbing is from the animated one behind the non-animated one?
Looks like there's two sprites, one animated and one not animated...?
Idk wtf in animation editor its cool and dandy
I do see that
top of the head of lost is kinda strange do you see that?
thanks that the one
Is this what you want?
yeah last one

My link form streamable that i uploaded yesterday, newes one
I can search for stuff, but tell me what to search for
If you're on discord canary you can search
or something like that?
Cant i show only my messages posted in this channel?
and i will show you what i mean
i need to find my upload of anim
Yup
32-bit?
is your png file
In anim editor it looks fine but in game
I have some problem with rendering animation, its kinda strange looking
isn't it drawing twice?
as well as rendering the layers
so if it's playing the idle animation
¯\_(?)_/¯
Because the Idle animation has the sprite
so then why play the idle animation at all
Wtf, discord is so laggy for me today
Yes, it's a POST_RENDER callback
Isnt it kinda callback?
Isnt is kinda callback?
what's the point of onRender()
so then what was the error
Yeah i had ":"
StandSprite:Play("animname")
```lua
local sprite = Sprite()
sprite:Load("gfx/tick.anm2", true)
sprite:Play("Idle")

local function onRender()
    sprite:RenderLayer(0, Vector(29, 37))
    sprite:RenderLayer(0, Vector(29, 49))
end```
¯\_(?)_/¯
My Sprite works fine now
Stand:GetSprite()
I mean
StandSprite.Play("animname")
and then i went
local StandSprite = Stand.GetSprite()
So i made
So yeah i have here entity Stand
I kinda killed that code off, but i will pastebin my actual code and will show what i was trying to do, give me a sec and i will rewrite it
pastebin that slut
if you want
we can probably get it working
I fucking hate Sprite() i tried to make it work on my entity and it just refused to work
basically, just gotta wait until they add more documentation about TearParams or whatever it is
but yeah, I'm sure it would overwite something like the razorblade from the Apple item
or change the color of the tear
most other tear effects are just stacked on top
Yeah i debuged for 20 mins and Y insead of y was my problem
TFW `"Idle"` not `"idle"`
coz you overwriting basic tear
eh
Dosent it kinda ruins all other tear effects?
which isn't even correct in all cases
the problem with my method is I also have to programmatically make it pick the right size of the tear based on the damage stat
<@116386733905412105> Thanks, that worked!
I mean I have the variant defined properly et al
you kinda cant coz its enum
so instead I replace the tears' sprite on update
I couldn't figure out how to just set the player's tear variant though
I have a custom tear variant, yes
you can also Sprite:SetFrame("animation_name", frame#)
<@116386733905412105> Oh dude, you did costume tear entity?
is how I got mine to work
local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
sprite:Play("animation_name", true)
oh i was thinking you want to do some kind of spritesheet
<@267156751936126977>
alright
My sprite is just one file
What do you mean by that?
Yeah but uts not like its single prite file
`sprite:Load("filename", true)`
`local sprite = Sprite()`
Then how you reference it tho
It has a `Render` method
I dont think you can just draw a sprite
You need to make entity using that sprite
¯\_(?)_/¯
Now I don't know how to get the sprite to draw
I was thinking about armor hearths that go over normal hearth and can take 3 hits before breaking
Nope
Oh wow, is this some kinda random generation thing?
198 consumables
What you doing atm?
You just add the sprite as spritesheet, add an animation, add a layer to the animation, select the sprite on the spritesheet and press Insert Frame
I got it
ahhahaha
animation editor is really wonky
oh wait
I've got it loaded as a spritesheet and I can add an empty animation
How the hell do I put the sprite into the animation editor?
Okay, I've been trying and came to nothing
so give me a sec
yeah I'm actually working on a similar issue right now too
Its a custom animation path Im trying to load btw
Im guessing the path is wrong
OK now its invisible but for a few particles
call sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true) except replace the file with the file you're looking for
seraphim
Anything that just acts on the sprite isnt going to workIll need to reset the entitys sprite to a new one
033.003_purple fireplace.anm2
033.002_blue fireplace.anm2
033.001_red fireplace.anm2
Im pretty sure the problem is that the Sprite is the wrong sprite for the variant
to see what informational messages there are when the entity loads/reloads/etc.
you can try digging through the log.txt
<@267156751936126977> is that just freezing it on a single frame?
Yeah I take that back, its still not working ?
even if it's just a static image?
I Think it's gotta be wrapped in an anm2 file
sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
Er, actually maybe its not working
After moving the png to `resources` folder it stopped erroring and started crashing ;D
also the difference between idle, idle2, and idle3 are just sprite variants for the same color fire
`sprite:Load("tick.png", true)`
Just restarting the animation using SetSpriteFrame("Flickering", 0) worked
what did you call on the sprite?
<@116386733905412105> thanks, I got my variant-switching thing to work
Ohh, let's see
kuberoot: the png's need to be 32-bit
Currently the game crashes ._.
Whats flickering2
Anybody worked with custom sprites knows if/how can I use png files as sprites?
and nofire is the logs with no orange on them
flickering is the flame as well as the logs
so idle is just the logs with some orange on them
Wow thats some tremendously bad spelling
[sic]
"Flickering" "NoFire" "Idle2" "Flickering2" "NoFire2" etc. for 3 and then Dissapear, Dissapear2, and Dissapear3
"Idle"
I guess theyre per-entity though
I just thought that the animation names would be more specific
Im not, I havent tried that
let me look though
I would assume so if you're getting an error that says no idle animation found
Thats it?
or "Idle"
"idle"
Whats the name of the Idle animation in 033.000_Fireplace.anm2
or you can try wine-ing it
I can tell you the names of the animations if you tell me what file you're looking for
yeah it's an .exe
Probably because Im using Linux?
My mod tools dont have an animation editor included
you'll have to look at the .anm2 file
it's just whatever the name of the animation is as shown in the animation editor
Also, how do animation names work
if sprite:Reset() or sprite:Reload() doesn't do it
yeah just guesswork here
that's literally making the entity tick
I think I tried sprite:Update() earlier
OK, ent:Update() doesnt seem to work
and sprite:Reload()
and sprite:Reset()
there's also a sprite:Update()
There is an ent:Update(), I'll try that
yeah there's an ent:Update()
So if I e.g. change a red fireplace into a blue fireplace it will functionally change but still look like a red fireplace until I re-enter the room
ent.Variant = NewVariant and then is there an ent:Update or ent:Init or something like that?
`entity.parent = entity`
ent.Variant = NewVariant doesnt reload the animation until I leave & re-enter the room
How do I change an entitys Variant?
<@116386733905412105> ill try that
And tell you how to do it in enums.lua
They give you exactly what they give the items
It's not hard at all
It follows Isaac
I mean
Yeah
and then there's a FollowParent() function on EntityFamiliar
and then you can just set the value of Entity.Parent to a target
dunno but there's a HasCommonParentWithEntity(Entity other)
Or how do i change the parent of a npc xd
?
what does GetLastParent_
They keep stacking on each other
Hmm i dont know how to do this shit
why do they make it so hard!
ill just make a copy of moms knife
grr
then it won't stick
so if your code doesn't re-adjust the value every time teh cache is updated
but if I keep spamming the change it will stick after a while
it will take the stat of the item
every time the cache is re-updated
seems the game reverts it back
but it doesnt stick
And modify stats if it does in the cache update
no I can change it
but what you can do is just add additional values
Check if the player has that item
that would be hardcoded and inaccessible probably
Basically
ty
ill mess with it
ok, I'm not sure
moms knife
right but I mean
i say existing item in the line above
or is it a pre-existing item
is it a custom item
so when he is given the item or its picked up it has a different damage value
I want to change the damage stat of an existing item through code
basically, it will skip any stat that doesn't have the flag added
right before you call EvaluateItems you gotta add the flags
but if you're manually trying to trigger a cache update
then it will occur when the item is acquired
so if your item's xml lists "damage" in its cache flags
ok
whenever you want it to update
uh
set that in init function or?
ok ill check
hmm
but if I keep spamming the value every frame it sets
for each stat you want to update
you gotta add cache flag
entityPlayer:AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE)
                entityPlayer:EvaluateItems()
it's not set
I give isaac an item, I say EvaluateCache, I get a callback in the cache function, I set a damage value on isaac
this cache thing is odd
true
oh yeah
EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR
so you should be able to search through the entities and just pick the ones that are familiars
there's an EntityFamiliar class
aren't they npcs
So that shouldnt work
tears are entities
BUt
that arent enemies?
Maybe look for entities
ty
Ill try to look for something like that
But
Theres no much info about familiars
Hmm
either that or make his parent your last familiar or something along those lines?
and then set his slot or something?
can you get a count of current familiar followers
um
How can I fix this :S?
Instead of spawning at the end of the row
On top of another familiar
He just spawns on the first slot
But if i have more familiars
He follows me
I have a problem with my custom familiar
Guys
Good idea
Add a MC_NPC_UPDATE callback
How do you get yourself an EntityNPC?
ProjectileParams() creates a new, empty set of parameters, so theyre probably all 0 by default
<@267156751936126977> y4eah UI tried to use FireProjectiles and FireBossProjectiles but neitgher work
I'll go test out random stuff
Nah, I dont think any of those fields will work
¯\_(?)_/¯
Maybe ProjectileParams().Variant
huh
And the game crashed again
Somebody tweet tyrone or whatever
Also the docs misspelled ProjectileParams as ProjectilParams
ProjectileParams().BulletFlags
Maybe try, idk
But that's just weird
Argument #1 is actually `ent`, so 4 should be WeaponType.WEAPON_TEARS, and I'm pretty sure other functions followed that pattern
If I pass 0 as the fourth parameter it just crashes
Y'know what's weird
log.txt says main.lua:36: bad argument #4 to 'FireProjectiles' (number expected, got userdata)
anybody know how to run code at the start of each floor?//////
dir is the direction I want to fire in (normalized), ent is the entity that is shooting
do any of you know how to know if the player is shooting and in what direction?
ent:FireProjectiles(ent.Position, dir*3, WeaponType.WEAPON_TEARS, ProjectileParams())
Hmm this might be harder than I thought
1 sec
I have suspicions but it's hard to be sure without seeing the code
<@267156751936126977> Show your exact code
can you get the direction the player is shooting?
Also when I try passing a ProjectileMode as the fourth parameter it says it wants a number
But the idea fits ¯\_(?)_/¯
Not sure if that's what you need
WeaponType.WEAPON_TEARS
I'd try the uh
Whats a ProjectilesMode
I cant figure out the third parameter
Check that in the docs to customize your projectiles
LuaDocs/class_projectile_params.html
Right now so it shoots
Cause i have to program my familiar
I hope it works
xD
Seraphim's
ask <@267156751936126977>
Not my problem xD
And what's your problem with `FireProjectile`?
Maybe that works?
Theres FireProjectile
There's no `FireTear` method
But I'm using the local files
I had to wait like 20 seconds for it to load
My documentation was loading slow
...the hell
Yep
Pretty sure you need `:` in that case
Try YourEnemy.FireTear(Position,Velocity, 0, 0, 0)
:S
cant you just modify those tears?
doesnt FireProjectiles() work?
Spawning a tear doesnt really work because I cant customise its speed, range, etc.
OK, I hate to repeat myself, but does anybody know how to get  custom enemy to shoot a projectile?
Get off the internet dad!
Hi Tired im Bob
its late im tired
oh no
I killed the chat

I think it would be too op if it persisted between rooms
Some parts may be possible others may not
Hurricane Isaac- 12 Room Recharge and when used makes a giant storm of tears flood the room for 30 seconds and persists between rooms and beams of light will also come down.
whats it do?
I also have this 12 room charge item
I would if i didnt have a mod i really want to see come to fruition
<:plum:259939492008296448> <:isaac_shocked:245063314692898817> <:2spooky:259939457703084032>
Oh thank god. I felt so pressured.
Eh thats upto you I dont want to force you into anything
I'm almost tempted to give it a try, though.
yeah I thought so
yeah thats the part that gets me i think the best way to do it would be to somehow turn the entity into a familiar
yea, one of the 100 things I wanna change
Doesn't sound impossible. But keeping it between rooms and floors sounds really tough.
Eh but a man can dream
Yeah, by the video it doesn't seem very apparent how the stealth mechanics work, <@122924009527574530>.
He was not sure about them staying charmed between rooms tho
its possible but widly beyond my scope
Well <@126590786945941504> said it was possible
you found yourself? how? what?
a temperary charm i could do pretty easy though
yeah that would ne hard you would ultimately have to turn the enemy into a familiar
sorry to lazy to rerite
just copy and pasted it
Well is it possible to make this steak useable to randomly charm a enemy in the room and make the stronger hp and damage wise? And make the charmed enemy go between floors and rooms? I might be asking for too much so sorry if you cant do this thats ok
whats it supposed to do?

im doin good hoping to find someone to code my grilled steak suggestion
<@122924009527574530> Ive found myself! <:angel_baby:230360200199012352>
oh the biggest issue with adding characters is assigning it custom items because IDs are borked to hell
how's everyone else doing
kk
So I'm gonna do an update today
ooooh that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yttGSiCW3Q8
1 sec
looking at it like that made me want to change like 100 things
Link, <@122924009527574530>?
whats your mod?
Cool
its 9 pm over here
someone just played my mod on youtube, really interesting to watch
gooood morning
haha i was there for that
You might be surprised at how demotivating it can be to spend about 2 days finding a solution to a problem that was literally just adding `return false`, though.
Sounds like a good idea good luck
Its petty bad but Its my first one
I was thinking of making a mod for BoI that included a bunch of StarCraft-related things. I was making a StarCraft 2 map that would effectively be a full implementation of BoI anyways, so an equivelant companion mod by the same name for the actual game sounds like a good idea.

here is one i have
Yeah I want unlocks too
but I dont even know if we can even lock them
the book being the only thing i have do is there to be what unlocks the characters
really?
I think ive been going at alot of my mod the wrong way.
Sounds cool and complex
Basically the character is the  platinum god character and is the embodiment of all isaacs happiness and achievements I have quite a few ideas for him.
what do you mean?
If I go through with a big mod I'm considering I might have to learn it anyways.
Hm. I'll have to look into that.
xml doesnt hold the meat of stats only health items costumes stuff like that
What's the idea, <@!188945290923868161>?
Really? That seems like it'd just be simple changes to some xml files.
I have an idea for a character but it may not be the best one...
i cant really change there stats or special things like unique atributes
anything i can do to a modified character i can do to what you could call a new one.
Probably wouldn't be a huge leap to go from there to making new ones when it's more accessible to you, and would allow you to get more work on the mod in while you wait.
You could always modify existing characters in the meantime.
they are but from what i can tell they are really compicated to do to much with
New characters aren't currently possible?
until we can do more with new characters there isnt much i can do for them
partial script Im set on spriting ive been doing that stuff since fakemons prime
Done as in sprited or scripted or both?
coolio
the item that will mimic the sins abilities
There's an AddCurse function.
I'll figure it out
riparoni
nobody knows how to apply a curse?
What do you currently have done, <@168775690152443925>?
Well mine isnt nessercarily a mod just a idea the grilled steak idea but if it was made it would prob go with the axe mod im working on with some people
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834707633&searchtext=seven
What mods are *you* two working on?
or mine haha..... ha..... <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121> <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121> <:troll_bomb:230143860813201408> <:troll_bomb:230143860813201408>
what about my mod haha.. ha.. <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121>
I might have to go relatively soon so I'm just chilling in the discord
Ah cool still love the brimstone bombs
Nothing ATM
Wait <@126590786945941504> what are you working on now?
In general I'd recommend learning the basics then trying to code a project you'd like while checking the book and the official documentation when you don't know how to do something
So, well, if you want the free online version, https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
I have been dipping my toes into coding since highschool but never much further then a basic understanding. stuff like loops if ands else elseifs that such
The first edition for 5.0 is free on the official Lua website
but re-reading your question i realize you're probably talking about a way of obtaining the book, which i don't know
but i found it useful, just sharing
Though I wouldn't recommend this if you don't have much experience with coding in general
if those things mean that much to an absolute beginner then yes, it has those limitations
There's also https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/ if you want a quick overview of Lua
anybody know how to apply a curse
Because having Lua locally means no delay, being sure about the specs and being able to use whatever libraries you want
yes
I have to assume they're talking about *learning* Lua.
why not just open that webpage too?
<@135254843567767552> Why not just install Lua and run `cmd.exe`?
but
And the differences aren't huge
5.0 is free
Well
this is pretty useful <https://repl.it/languages/lua>
Whats the best cheaps and legal option for Programming in Lua? how different is Lua 5.0 from 5.3 and so on?
https://streamable.com/uj66e Something im work on with <@!120669965236830208>  and <@164178433453064192> and <@113732793787351044> props to for the coding and Iguest for animation help and Esse with helping testing and a couple synergie sprites idea done by me and the main axe sprite
Oh, nevermind.

Does anyone know how to make a custom enemy
Yep !
With `</players>`, right?
Probably ridiculous against bosses if you get that early on.
And at the end of the file you close it?
And the rest of the file, obviously
<@126590786945941504> at the start of the file there is : ```<players bigportraitroot="gfx/ui/stage/" nameimageroot="gfx/ui/boss/" portraitroot="gfx/ui/boss/" root="gfx/characters/costumes/">```
Seems useful.
Not what I was expecting at all.

Got a gif of the brimstone bombs? Kinda wanna see.
Whoa da lag
discord at it again
Whoa those brimstone bombs are cool
<@126590786945941504> Good job
Like for example in items you have to wrap it in an items tag `<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">`
<@126590786945941504> Good job
Don't you need to do, like
And the costume 41 is referenced on costume2.xml :

```<costume anm2path="Character_016_mv.anm2" id="41" priority="1" type="none" />```
<@126590786945941504> Good job

Sounds work-aroundy. I think I'd rather complain to random people on the internet.
I cant figure out how to use the last two parameters
ooh, z offset
Has anyone managed to get EntityNPC::FireProjectiles() to work?
There's just a whole lot of stuff that might be usable in some way
¯\_(?)_/¯
There's `RenderLayer`, for one
If you mess around with Z offset and overlays and other properties of Sprites
What's your idea?
I'm thinking you might be able to draw on the UI, thought I haven't experimented with it
Bah, I want to add a new heart type. Hurry up and let us draw on the UI, Nicalis.
That's the point ¯\_(?)_/¯
Will re-try one by one
Well if i remove all .xml files it should work as there should be no more mod to load
And even if you remove all xml files it still crashes?
Done that few times already.
Try removing individual stuff from them until it works
Im giving brimbombs a shot
Check if your xmls are valid
And i don't know where the error could be -_-
Trying to add a new character.

So far, i have : 
- A modified costumes2.xml in wich i have added a line who call the modified anm2 file
- A modified players.xml who calls the correct costume ID & name & skin file (sprite)
- A modified charactermenu.anm2 & charactermenu.png & characterportraits.anm2 to add animation & sprite for the new character selection
yeah
No, I mean seriously, props to you, though mind you, I'm just a random internet stranger, my advice isn't always going to be good
<@168775690152443925> if you need help with a couple sprites message me im sure I could help.
<@168775690152443925> What can I say, you're a good person, hope you learn and get to finish your mod!
yes I've been working on it no stop when im not playing rock band or working
<@168775690152443925> and your the one with that sin mod inmind that sounds like an awesome idea!
Well
THats fine but if you are able todo it I very much appreciate it
<@!188945290923868161> That seems very much doable, though not sure about persisting between continues
and to anyone who would be interested please read my description on my mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834707633&searchtext=seven
Otherwise use cmd to run stuff
Well is it possible to make this steak useable to randomly charm a enemy in the room and make the stronger hp and damage wise? And make the charmed enemy go between floors and rooms? I might be asking for too much so sorry if you cant do this thats ok
Thanks for your input <@126590786945941504>.
And I just use Sublime Text with Lua build system
Lua, for sure
Well
<@126590786945941504> I've decided to take a break from making a mod until I better understand Lua so for testing what I learn what would be then best program?
Check your files ¯\_(?)_/¯
hah
```[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...```
The console do not give a lot of informations...
Is your error not in log.txt?
Is there a way to read the minidump generated while crashing ?
And I have a few ideas
Well, I'm willing to code something o/
But im not half bad at sprites
Well if im ever gonna mod anything im going to NEED somebody to code cause I have tried and tried again I just dont get it
So decide for yourself
Especially for coding, to me it's just absurd
But I personally hate youtube tutorials and dislike video tutorials in general
Nope im just about to try the snappy one I wonder if the person who made it is on this discord
I'd personally advise you to watch no videos and read PiL along with using documentation while coding
<@126590786945941504> would you advise that I used the book or watched videos to learn Lua better?
Have you tried Brimstone Bombs yet? ;D
Some nice mods are starting to come out
Damn it works. That's awesome that you can access data like that, same it isn't as simple as 'IsDead()"
The way to use it I mean
Oh thats pretty simple
If you'd like
https://hastebin.com/eruwobejeb.lua
I can give you my adversarystonebombs source if you want to see how I've done it
Sweet, I'll see how it goes
Yep, you want `GetSprite`
Yeah, "IsEventTriggered (string EventName)"
Wait, I think 'sprite' can deal with this.
I am not sure if you can even check for events, I can't seem to find it in the docs.
The person who was working on changing bomb sprites
it seems a really round about way, but it's the only way I can think of
Forgot their nick
Yeah, I do that in stone bombs, idea based on uh
thats brilliant lol
oh shit, i could check for their animation
There's two events http://i.imgur.com/IPPubwR.png
You either want to check if the animation is of the broken one or maybe if the event was triggered
http://i.imgur.com/Jg0zgZm.png
No, that's not what you want
erm
"levelitem_001_itemaltar" I assume this is used when they blow up and give an item
hm, I did find a sprite of broken slots
You could check the sprite
perhaps
You'll have to check other properties
my active item is basically finding dead slot machines and respawning them
but when it blows up, it's not classes as dead
1 is the variant
6 is the type
http://i.imgur.com/BFc8Zay.png
I am trying to render text what the sub type is, but i'm not getting anything.
hm
Lemme check
yeah
If so, that'd be a subtype
i don't see any slot sub or variants on the docs
Aren't all the machines variations?
erm
but its a variation
it still is the entity
what even is it's sub type
That'd be logical
I have no idea what happens to it
It changes subtype, doesn't it?
I found something interesting. When you blow up a slot machine it doesn't actually die...
its easier when a human can explain it in a more natural way
It's for old versions of Lua and very friendly I'd say
i have been but i have a hard time understand the technical aspects
https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
I'd recommend reading Programming in Lua for more info on the basics
`{}` is a table literal
Though `pairs` doesn't guarantee any order when iterating
so what did it mean when you put {} instead of ()?
Here's example output from `pairs`
$$eval local t = {3,4,2,6}
t.asdf = 5
t[20] = 7

for k, v in pairs(t) do
    print(tostring(k)..": "..tostring(v))
end
```
Output:
1: 3
2: 4
3: 2
4: 6
20: 7
asdf: 5

```
The more useful function is `pairs`, which goes through **all** keys of a table
It's mostly for convenience
And `for k, v in ipairs(t) do` is equivalent to ```lua
for k = 1, #t do
    local v = t[k]```
So, basically, `ipairs` goes through the supplied table from 1 to `#table`
Yep, exactly that
It'd print ```
1: 3
2: 4
3: 2
4: 6```
```lua
local t = {3,4,2,6}
t.asdf = 5
t[20] = 7

for k, v in ipairs(t) do
    print(tostring(k)..": "..tostring(v))
end
```
So if you had something like
Returning the key and the value
so this is my understanding of the code and frome what i can tell i need toe value of v i dont know what he assigned it too
That goes through values of an array part of the table in ascending order
ipairs returns an iterator
Basically
```
for i,v in ipairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do --i think this means its searching or i and v in RoomEntities
        if (v.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and v:IsDead() and v.Parent ~= nil and v.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER) then --from what i can tell this is checking if v matches the tear type, if its dead, and if the parent is the player
            vec = Vector(0, -40) --assigning vector to a variable, not sure why this is global
            room = game:GetRoom() --getting room
            for i=1,4 do --cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4
                for j=1,30 do --same as last
                    if (room:IsPositionInRoom(v.Position + vec * j, 40)) then --not quite sure how to interpret this
                        Isaac.Spawn(1000, EffectVariant.ROCK_EXPLOSION, 0, v.Position + vec * j, Vector(0, 0), v) --this spawns the effect where v died and sets v as the effects parent
                    end
                end
                vec = vec:Rotated(90) --also not sure why this is global
            end
        end
    end
```
When inside a \`\`\` block, enter goes down a line instead of sending

    here
\`\`\`
how do i post code?
Wasteland, do you still need help with ipairs?
I think i just figured it out
I sucessfully loaded the modified sprite, can't figure how to rightly load a new character on the select screen
Hey, do someone have an idea of how to load an amn2 file along side a sprite for a new character ?
Seems like you need to be a little hacky to get the most out of the API, though.
B a d p r a c t i c e
That's hacky asf
when I get home I'll have to futz with it some
who knows what you can do with it
well if it returns a table by reference...
it returns a table
storing arbitrary data within the entity itself
It has a getter, but no setter, so it can't really be used, right?
anyway gonna leave now, thanks for the help, etc etc etc. Gn
since the entities are userdata and you can't throw new data on them i suppose
<@267112861921181697> I suggest watching a series of lua tutorials, it teaches you a lot about syntax and the basics of coding. A lot of questions you're having, such as variable types and such, will be answered.
from what i've seen <@228680372215349249> getdata never has anything, but it could be a table you could put data in?
That is probably important to me, but I have no idea what you just said, zeta.
gotcha
Yeah
so that way it wont affect enemy tears?
Ender that will return true for any entity spawned by the player, I believe
wait, GetData returns a mutable serialized table for the given entity?
Oh, ok
that basically says (as far as I can tell) <@267112861921181697> , if the tear's (assuming tear) "parent" entity (edit:) exists and IS the player, then do: etc
I imagine it's check if v.Parent exists, and if it does, checking if it's the player.
for k,v in pairs(table) do will go from key to key and repeat the code within
for i,j in ipairs(table) do will go from index 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 etc and repeat the code within
I was looking at the code Swift gave me and i was wondering what this line does? If anyone would be willing to explain. ``v.Parent ~= nil and v.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)``
tables tables and tables in lua, it's all tables through and through
so when you put for v, i on ipairs() do it loops looking for those values in the ipairs?
I hate how everything seems to have a different word for what effectively amounts to nameable arrays.
ipairs iterates a table that uses indices, pairs iterates a table that uses keys
You can look up a key and get the value for it
it's like a dictionary
anyway would someone mind explaining how ipairs works
not for you to tell us who you did and didn't block
So how 'bout that data continuity.
is for modding
<#205854782542315520>

Drama's fun, though.
At least some of the people here are just saying its programmer's rage or that at some point we are all gonna find some stupid syntax errors we wont forgive ourselves for
Drama...
You don't really have much room to speak. You've been a bit of an asshole since the moment I've seen you. The very first impression you gave me was attacking and belittling a guy that was trying to make a PSA about workshop security.
(well, not whole point, but some of it.)
Which is, I dunno, the whole point?
You were a complete asshole from the moment I joined and asked one question
First off fuck off
Not necessarily
obvious missing ends
Afterwards you'll clearly say what's the problem with unclosed functions
Close the function\
First step: Indent your code
You see an error, you just count the ends
oh, really
Or 3x Puberty
It says something about closing a function (which I counted the "ends; there are enough) near <eof> I don't really know what that means but I didn't want to give this cunt his pay
Why "I found pills"?
pray for an i found pills or a balls of steal
What does it say?
Yes I have
hey you both need to take a ??? pill
Have you checked your log.txt?
I guess I'll just do the init thing as well, then. Until someone finds a better way, at least.
If they say its just a syntax error, GREAT! now I know what to fucking look for.,
I never said fix my code for me, i said if there is a reason WHY.
Tell Kube to clam the fuck down I am just trying to learn
Except you're not trying to learn, you're just going in "Hey guys PM me when you fix my code thanks"
Wow calm down guys
I never took any classes, I haven't coding an a few years, so stop being a crying bitch and let me ease back into this, mkay? It is kind of hard to learn when dicks like you are constantly biting my ass.
If you had a clue about programming you'd read your code, swift's code and notice what swift's code uses that your code doesn't have
of course I do you cunt
But you have no idea how the rest of your code works either, apparently
I didn't create the rock explosion code, mate. I have no idea how it works.
*dabs at ludicrous speeds

So it's either "I have data for the run" or "It's a new run"
You can only have one run going at once
what
well yeah, but I still need at least a unique identifier for the run
There is a way to store mod data
<@128874748041101312> the tear code does not work, are there any variables I need that I do not have?
y'know
if I'm going to do serious modding I'm going to need to figure out some way of storing data linked to a particular run
But I have no clue how to use it
I mean, there's Entity:GetData(), that might be what you want
meh
that's pretty gay tbh
Nope, but you can always wrap the object in a table
so you can't use custom attributes
Do you have variables that I need?
I see
`bombs[v.Index] = {bomb=v, sprite=v:GetSprite(), dmg=v.ExplosionDamage or ply.Damage}`
oh
what
The table contains the bomb object
oh
That's just a table
it didn't work for me
`v.i = v.i + 1`
What custom attributes?
<@128874748041101312> it doest work
you can use custom attributes in the api?
All else fails, I'm fine using Holy Mantle as a workaround.
<@126590786945941504> wait what the fuck
now that I know that things become a little easier lol
<@112975821186031616> huh. *shrug*
Here's the source: https://hastebin.com/xahitiyicu.lua
SLot machine is npc
Here's the video: https://streamable.com/8oqj7
I thought isDead only worked for NPCs, let me see
Are you sure 0 damage to the player is possible, <@228680372215349249>? I still seem to be taking a hit.
<@126590786945941504> yeah
<@225183252757872641> IsDead
<@128874748041101312> Want my stonebombs source?
<@128874748041101312> I just realised I need to get the dead slot machine entities so I can respawn them. Is that even possible with the api atm?
Eh, they pop up all at once? D:
under if have collectible I assume
in your update
where would I put that, TheSwiftTiger
would make your tears seem really powerful
I think this idea would be best if it just shockwaved in the direction the tear was going when it hits something
we have access to param hight but we cant use it
I don't mind if you keep it, you made it after all
```lua
    for i,v in ipairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
        if (v.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR and v:IsDead() and v.Parent ~= nil and v.Parent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER) then
            vec = Vector(0, -40)
            room = game:GetRoom()
            for i=1,4 do
                for j=1,30 do
                    if (room:IsPositionInRoom(v.Position + vec * j, 40)) then
                        Isaac.Spawn(1000, EffectVariant.ROCK_EXPLOSION, 0, v.Position + vec * j, Vector(0, 0), v)
                    end
                end
                vec = vec:Rotated(90)
            end
        end
    end```
I think arcing is possible, if you mean tears
Actually
<@128874748041101312> can I have the code or are you going to keep it?
erm
it is the same end result i need too for mine too though
<@168775690152443925> I don't think arcing is possible :/
invisible, zero damage tear that just spawns ground upheaval under it
not your thing
I'm pretty sure that was for me
haha lol i want mine to arc and explode and also be green too
"Mean Emotional barasingha"
...ooh, item idea
gfycat
what even is that link?

rip
that's what i wanted fuck

gimme a sec
it's just like
<@128874748041101312> so about that sloth tear? how would i go about that
gn
ill try this again tommrorow
anyway
is it that new heart that you cant pick up the first time
I guess not
I thought it was just a bug that red hearts were sometimes hard to pick up
Ha. Didn't know that existed.
and it keeps running away from you
it's a heart that is hard to pick up
I seriously wish I could say the same about myself. I feel like I just throw ideas at the wall all the time and will end up making the same mistakes in the future if I come across these problems again.
I just realized that HEART_SCARED is not just a mis-spelling of sacred
Yet how come when I raged once this morning everyone fucking attacked me?
^
we all think THE DOC IS SHIT
that's just plain ol programmer frustration imo
You didnt waste time you learned what doesnt work
"THE DOC IS SHIT"
"WHY THE FUCK ISNT THIS WORKING"
how were you a dick?
Just kind of sad that I wasted a few hours for nothing
I was a dick so its not like i deserved answers
Its okay
Sorry I couldn't help you most of the time, <@267112861921181697>.
Thanks a lot, <@228680372215349249>. I hate asking for help, but I'm glad I could get some when I feel out of options.
sorry for being a cunt
thanks for the help, Ill persue it tomorrow when i can think straight
Bye guys
ooo cool help
yeah
<@128874748041101312> would you know how to replicate sloths explosive tear then?
^ that was my mistake
for all you know that could mean that you used a ":" instead of "."
Thats not exactly how the error info lines work
It started telling me I was giving it nil values when right above it the values were shown
no fucking clue why
i had to delete the code for other reasons, I was getting so many errors
Right, right.
<@112975821186031616> well, by only calling when damage is nonzero and passing in zero damage you're limiting it to a single level of indirection
that's pretty easy
he wants to make the tear explode using the EffectType ROCK_EXPLOSION
that apply tear effects
you know what might be kinda cool? a more common "version" of epic fetus that shoots those tear downfalls from antibirth instead
s
Well that was a big old waste of three fucking hour
what do you mean by apply effects to tears
honestly i dont think we know how to do anything more then spawn them and aim them
Can i change it to the thing the shoots in four direction?
<@267112861921181697> I dont really think we know how to apply effects to tears yet
now I've gotta find the subtype, as I don't want beggers to be trigger by the active
Kapp
D e a t h C o m e s
then just go down to the chest instead
I could try it, but I'm worried about infinite loops here.
My god it works! <@128874748041101312>  thank you! I actually wrote the line before but I must of used : rather than .
well, I mean call the TakeDamage function on Isaac (process another hit)
sys
Unless you wanted me to trigger the 0 damage before the damage is taken, but wouldn't that trigger it again?
I never wanted to die so much right now
<@128874748041101312> I hope that's it, been trying for a little while lol.
That was what I was looking to accomplish in the first place, but I couldn't seem to find how to modify the damage taken.
rip teddy
<@225183252757872641> if (v.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_SLOT) then
Still stabbing the crap out of a teddy bear, though.
if damage >0 hit with 0 damage and same everything else, then return false
I could kiss you either way, <@228680372215349249>.
fuck
``[INFO] - [Healthcare] Error in PostUpdate call: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/ascension/main.lua:12: attempt to call a nil value (global 'GetEntityIdByName')``
I don't think it'd break things, but it'd make my item less useful on someone that already has Holy Mantle.
try... uhh
well actually
Stupid, maybe, but it makes sense, considering the callback is also what handles the invulnerability frames.
<@112975821186031616> would that still break things with holy mantle passive?
Hey guys ? I've been trying to figure out how to check the current room you're in for slot machines. I know how to get all the entities in the room into a variable but I have no idea how to check their type in a if loop, and ideas?
you have to use a hacky ass solution
but for something as simple as that
you should just be able to give the player invincibility frames
that's stupid
nice tibbit
So applying Holy Mantle immediately before seems to work, as far as I can tell.
However, returning false also makes it not give you invulnerability frames.
Alright, well, actually it did work.
been trying past 2 days to get custom giant books
TOO THE LOGSSSS
Neither seemed to have worked, I'm afraid.
didn't work
<@228680372215349249> haha hasnt been in my scope all week
magfest etc.
why not a p e r s o n
no idea, wasn't within the scope of my one day of messing with this thing
Why a teddy bear?
<:isaac_cute:231218432148766720>
<@228680372215349249> oh great and all might zetaPRIME how do i call giant book animations
.. at least, I think it's false; might be inverted
I swear to god if you're right I'm going to stab the next teddy bear I find.
if you return false within the callback function it cancels the hit entirely
I'm not sure what you mean, <@228680372215349249>.
oh yeah
that can cause problems with other effectrs
I can't imagine that would work with The Lost or similar situations.
Just make Isaac heal instantly
<@112975821186031616> return false
i still need to be able to play giant book animations before i continue and no one has made any strides there
I've spent the past 2 days trying to figure out a good way of making Isaac ignore damage from the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback.
f u n
time to test it
At least yours is getting done.
This code took half of my night
```    if player:HasCollectible(avalanche) then
        rocktear = GetEntityTypeByName(ENTITY_TEAR)
        rockshock = rng:RandomInt(5);
        if rocktear:IsDead() then 
            if rockshock == 1 then
            Isaac.Spawn(1000, 62, 0, rocktear.Position, 0, nil)
            end
        end
    end```
<@112975821186031616> true
Using the full names sounds a lot more future-proof, though.
just put 0
or zero at least
I don't want it to move
can vecolity be nil
velocity sorry
you dont have to write out EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT and so on they have ids for a reason
whats vol
Worth a try, anyways.
EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.ROCK_EXPLOSION, something something something.
Isaac.Spawn(1000, 62, 0, pos, vol, probs nil)
I think you can spawn them, actually.
Think Rock Bombs from Antibirth
The fat worms in basement that make that rock circle around them and shoot ipecac blood shots
Inherited from them, at least.
round worms?\
I mean, apparently Effects are Entities.
I want to spawn that thing that the Round worms do when they come out of the ground
scrolling through the entities and seeing "BABY_WHORE" throws you off gaurd
and you cant spawn that sorry EnderShot, i think you might be able to spawn something with that effect
no you dont
Do you *spawn* effects?
ROCK_EXPLOSION
Isn't that an effect?
lots of things have that id i need the exact name of the entity
id is 62
rock explosion, yes
You're looking to spawn an explosion?
Seriously I am confused about the parameters for the spawn command
i only play with a controller
same button as swap cards/pills
yes RT is drop trinket on controller
from the round worms
I want the circle explosion, not the grid one
No
You are a bit
rock explosions are grid aren't they?
oh that's right he probably blocked me for being an annoying prick
I know the code is Isaac.Spawn() but I don't really know the params
<@150336707609231362> how do I spawn a rock explosion (62)
that was a thing in rebirth lol
Eh, can't be bothered to restart.
_turns on his controller._
You suuuure? My friend said he could do it.
no binding
nope
I think it's RT for a controller.
ok bois i'm back
fyi
That was a thing well before Afterbirth+, ya know.
I legitimately never knew you could do that
but if you use a controller it wont
oh wow
yup
Yeah
ctrl drops your trinket???
hold control and stand still
and press control to drop it
giveitem [trinket name
you can do
oh spawn- name
in the console I mean
not code
Command
Isaac.Spawn
what's the command for spawning a trinket on the ground?
then do code
Oh ok
if rocktear:IsDead()
if IsDead
but it's a function
it returns a boolean
returns
i am confused
not a fucntion
that's a boolean
IsDead returns if it's dead or not
like it executes while dead
does it do things when it is dead?
cause IsDead is a function
no
would that work?
if rocktear.isDead == true
how would I incorporate isdead into a eqausion that figures out the final place of a tear and spawns a rock shockwave
so
as long as it Exists
Whether or not it's dead, something needs to 'exist' to be checked if it's dead.
good to know
ok
it still saves the data for a couple frames after it dies
how Am i going ot get a position from something that's dead
it doesn't matter
its dead
>_>
.Position
how would i even use that to determine the final spot an entity was
although I do agree that the docs are bullshit, you should probably learn to use them before you complain
lol
"IsDead"
Well, I checked the entire fucking documentation and NOTHING
there *is* a check if something is dead
how the fuck do I even SPAWN THINGS
Because Tyrone hates you.
why is there not a check if something is dead my god
It's not on reddit. I made a post about it yesterday too.
check it
and found nothing
reddit
<@168775690152443925>  I've been looking for this exact thing
I should try recreate BoI in Unreal... That could be an interesting challenge to say the least
Has anyone found a way to play an animation as an overlay like the giant books. I've been fudging with the sprite class all the last two days. The best I can get is spawning in an entity in the center of the room and playing the animation over that but it plays under all the sprites in the room, I don't really want to spawn in entity to do this and it only works in normal sized rooms.
'night all
The documentation doesn't even help at all
Anyways, Imma sleep, guess I'll get the code fixed tomororw morning
HOW THE FUCK DO I EVEN USE THE COORDINATES, MUCH LESS FIGURE OUT WHERE A TEAR FUCKING DIES
And then 650 out of those are HP ups for Keeper in Greed Mode XD
giveitem [itemname]
i just go in and use the console
Just R scum 700 times or so
Your chance of finding it is about 700 to 1.
Theres like 700 items in the base game and youve made 1.
next api update most liekly
Are you sure?
Oh, well that's disappointing.
new items don't spawn
ever
I don't use unreal
Hmm... Fuck.
So obviously, Endershot, use a Get Boolean to check if something is dead... Then again this is mostly Unreal Engine 4 knowledge...
Why did I bother going into programming, I cant do shit
I'm guessing that all new items right now just get stuffed into the Treasure Room pool then?
Get gets the state of the Boolean, True or False, Set changes its value
Posting again, just need to close the endless loop that happens in lines 25-34 somehow
how the fuck do I even check if something is dead
But with Booleans you have Get and Set
https://hastebin.com/xivukatiye.lua
Its hard to explain
Right, I'm just not sure where it goes or what exactly the code would be
Sort of
Boolean is just a simple True False check
Oh booleans are easy
gimme your code
I know Ender said somethin' about Boolean, but I'm not sure how to implement that into the code.
item pools are impossible rn
I just need the code to cut off the loop so I don't endlessly spawn flies. Then also need to know  if there's something I need to do to make my item spawn in the Treasure Room item pool.
but right now the coords are fucking useless
if i could USE the coordinates then i could try to do something
It should also be pretty powerful, its a one use item
I just don't know how to use the cordinates
But i dont know what it should do
<@267112861921181697> try to make somethign one step up
I have an idea for an item
<@166249905772429312> If you need help with lots of programming PM me and I'll see what I can do
I copied hothead
Didn't you already make Insanity or whatever.
I guininely cannot do anything then, since any other item I think of is utter shit/already exists/impossible to code/etc
<@267112861921181697> Sorry but I'm not up to guide you step by step on how to do it :p go read thing and try some stuff. Maybe you are beign too ambitius for your own skills right now
sorry to be a nuisance
i n e e d s l e e p p l s
it wont take long
at every battle
yell KAIRI
pls help me make rocktear first pls
maybe sora should just
LMAO
how do i put in the code you told me
oh and the tagline is "You'll never take it"
i mean like
k thx
please make an item called Kairi's Heart. And at the start of every boss fight the sound clip of sora yelling that plays at a way too loud volume... and the item does nothing else
alright. I dotn know what you mean by "put it in"
also if i suddenly go offline or afk that means my dad has told me to shut off the PC so
so how do i put it in
anyways
oh well that works
I know a few things but have never played it myself
rip rocktear
since its a KH mod
do you know a bit about kingdom hearts
just to make sure
but
lmao
but sure
i never said i need a programmer
o no
whats that... you say you need a programmer? <:isaac_wink:259964931863085057>
i will only take a minute i think
Jacob pls
D:
Lookin' good, <@134478547795443712>.
we don't have one
^
just relay it to your programmer :)
what do i do with it
actually i know what it does but
can shoot is not true
or what to do with it
i have no idea what that does
nyagh
so
i have no lua noror programming knowledge
uhhh
<@166249905772429312> try player:CanShoot(false)-=false- or you could do player.FireDelay=99999
Not about my mod
don't be salty I'm still waiting
isn't your mod fixed
I feel like I'm losing my mind
same
die
*dabs at maximum velocity
you dont
without the actual blindfold graphic being there
can someone tell me how to make isaac start with blindfold
ez a toitise
thanks for transformation code ;D
eyy bois
saw that, its very cool :D

We should probably all get some sleep soon :p
Same.
its 2 AM for me too
though I am far from it
don't mean to be salty but its two am and I want to get this done
I cant figure this shit out
Not quite sure how to put that in.
but what did you do when it looped back over?
do a reset when leaving the room or something
sets to false, no moe flies
if the Boolean is true, spawn a fly
<@244660325905989632> I had that issue, make a Boolean and make it false after entering the room
Like, when I entered a room, it endlessly spawned the flies
you are going to have to check if it already went off once
no problam! glad I can help :D
I finally got the second effect to start working, <@150336707609231362>. The issue is, it worked endlessly, methinks I ended wrong somehow
Thanks for your help
Works like a charm.
Death of tear, how do you do...
Okayyyy
ah....
so if Entity.SubType==HeartSubType.HEART_FULL
heart is a sub type
so Entity.SubType.HeartSubType?
h o w *
b u t h  w
save it every frame
<@134478547795443712> Entity.SubType
is there sometihg like DeathPosition or something
I cant figure out how to figure out the final position of the tear
that looks good
``    if player:HasCollectible(avalanche) then
        rocktear = GetEntityTypeByName(ENTITY_TEAR)
        rocktear.Position`` this is my code so far
entity most likely
it definitely exists.
But I don't know what class it's a part of
*shrug*
yeah
.HeartSubType doesn't seem to be a member of the class, which is why it can't compare
"With Feeling!"
whats that phrase about imo
Here goes, once more, with feeling!
<@134478547795443712> yeah thats the problam I got as well. its very strange
I don't think .HeartSubType is a member
if entities[i].HeartSubType == HeartSubType.HEART_FULL then
I feel like I'm not using the right code
<@150336707609231362> after fixing the DOUBLEPACK, it now despawns no hearts
for my healthcare item
I used that code before
That works fine probably, let's give it a whirl
for <@244660325905989632>
I know what that does
Well
What
if Game():GetRoom():IsFirstVisit() then
its 2 am here
"A little bit" right now would be the rest of the night XD
So i defined the variable rocktear, how do I find its final position
Any thoughts on different code to make it so the math.random flies appear at the start of every new room discovered? Like, entering a room for the first time.
<@244660325905989632> If you are feeling overwhelmed take a break for a little and coem abck
Blah
yeah, that should be it
``GetEntityTypeByName(ENTITY_TEAR)``
hang on
what
ent=Isaac.GetRoomEntities() for i=0, #ent do if ent[i]--SomethingSomething end
that should return an array of entities
I feel like I just need to edit it some bit..
I have this line ``entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )``
I haven't delved this far before
GetENTITY_TEAR?
Kind of wish the guy who gave me the code was still here, but he left some time ago
how do I get an entity
<@150336707609231362> Didn't change anything after deleting the second Game():GetRoom()
it can be changed
or can i set it per item pedastol
is item pool set per room?
is what its called
<@267112861921181697> ENTITY_TEAR
I'll give it a whirl
I think they should
and bombs I guess
Hm, that'd leave the parentheses in .GetDecorationSeed() empty, should they be?
The only tear entities shown are knife laser and brimstone
<@267112861921181697> Its an entity
Tears are entities, right?
theres nothing in the docs about tear position
shoudl only need one
How the heck do I even figure out where the tear is, much less where it disappeared
could be because you are using 2  getRoom
I suspect it might be because it doesn't work right when the Callback at the bottom is updating at a different time, but I don't really understand functions here.
And related to that is line 2
It's lines 25-28 in this. https://hastebin.com/licitikojo.lua
nothing at fucking all that is useful anyway
Theres nothing in the doc about tears
I was getting it on hastebin again
hmm, I have no idea then. whats the 2nd part?
That's not the issue
i'm looking for the effect data
<@150336707609231362> They are a variant of Blue Flies, they're simply named after the Horsemen of the Apocalypse (and Wrath for some reason.)
no, its impossible to get normally
not the gfx
costume
i meant the effect
boolean. its true or false
sigh
its a costume
the cuck is a bool
no its a bool
is the blindfold even an item though
<@244660325905989632> I saw that you where using the Locust guys. Those are just the bosses and I think this confirms my though. they arent differnt types of flies
I was gonna ask another question but at this point if I am asking this much I proabably wont be able to get it done on my own and I would just be a nuisance.
me neither
Enumeration > CollectibleType. I'm not seeing it, though.
hm
you would have to follow the tear (get its entity) then get the last position before it stops existing
I honeslty don't know much about tear modifying
<@112975821186031616> where can i find those?
Now I appear to be having another issue.  It seems the code I was given to make the extra flies appear in the second effect doesn't seem to work. Any assistance, <@150336707609231362>, once EnderShot's done?
finally released my mod > http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837601013
how would I get that?
you'd need to get the position of where it lands and spawn the stuff around it
it ok
oops
<@267112861921181697>  you
when tears contact the ground
Jacob how would I make an item that makes it so on contact with the ground it makes a rock pulsewave
I'd check Collectible Effects.
time to find out where the blindfold data is stored
alright
I would bet there's a blindfold effect you could apply. Might want to start there.
<@134478547795443712> I have no idea why it cant compair properly, btw
anyone know how we can make it so isaac doesn't shoot tears, and we want to change the range of spear of destiny
lol
oh you're not talking to me
why does it need to return true?
?
huh
at the end all you have to do it return(true)
how do I animate holding an active item above your had
<@150336707609231362> I have a much simpler issue btw
it also appreas to just not be compairing correctly
<@150336707609231362> Thank you
oh
prism tear
what exactly do you want help with?
pls help
gues so
he ded
<@134478547795443712> I found you reason. doublepack is one word I think
make sure its spelt right
<@134478547795443712> So when it gets to the double pack it delets everything
Or am I just being silly and function doesn't go where I've put it
"function mod:update()
                local cID = Game():GetRoom().GetDecorationSeed(Game():GetRoom())
                if cID ~= oID then oID = cID" this part.
so has anyone figured out how to add a new character yet?  been trying to figure it out since AB+ launch, and no luck
The code that I was told would make it so the second effect here would work on entering a new room that hasn't been entered before
Jacob how did you become a lua pro?
Ufh.
kk
<@267112861921181697> Sorry. I'll try and help after this
very strange
launching isaac with instapreview from the room editor causes the game to crash on launch with this error: http://pastebin.com/9aFdfdqV anyone had any luck?
rip me
I'll try and find the error. Give me a minut <@134478547795443712>
Now it's working again, but it's not spawning flies upon entering a new room
maybe FULL and HALF are attributed to multiple things
I've tested it with enemies, other consumables
Hum.
No it just gets rid of hearts
<@134478547795443712> maybe remove is removing all entities, not just the one?
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2765/the-losts-hardcoded-holy-mantle
?
And forgot to delete the update.it
rip prism tearsw
Can someone help me out? With this current code, all hearts despawn, when I only want red and hybrid hearts to despawn.
https://hastebin.com/onocejinim.lua
Tryin' again
Right then
yes
So like that?
"for i=0, math.random(1-3) do"
dangit
thats the problam
no =
for i=0,1
Maybe should've removed the comment, but not sure if that's the whole problem
can you help me?
soudns pretty cool
yeah
https://hastebin.com/zuxupabiyu.lua
is my idea possible?
may I have a look?
That's the first math.random
error on line 29
"...ding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/swarm of locusts/main.lua:29: <name> expected near '0'"
I want to make a tear modifier that makes you shoot out a Prismatic Tear occasionally that when it hits a wall splits into the colours of the rainbow
and crickets body
Kind of.
like parasite?
Yes
Is it possible to make tears split on contact with something
helps a lot
I have a real-time logger
always
TO THE LOG
if it keeps saying its old then that means the mod is crashing. You have an error somewhere
I thought of an item but its too similar to camo shorts
It keeps saying it's old
that's good
Sorry trying to think of an item
I accidentally deleted the metadata.xml last time, derp.
thats all I've ever done
yup
Just that?
delete the update.it inside the mod folder
Guh, I forgot what to do if it's saying the mod's Old
As far as I cant tell you can but its not easy
or is that not a thing yet
Jacob can you make new tears?
so <@267112861921181697> you wanted to talk about things?
i get this error: http://pastebin.com/9aFdfdqV
but now cant find the floor xml files
and then I made the folder to resources so it could find the entities2.xml
I did
need to unpack the assets
Wait, how do u get the room editor to find the floor xml files
yeah, I have before
game crashes on launch
and resets on the next
anyone had any luck getting instapreview to work in the room editor?
an item that gives you stat up for every pickup you find on the current floor
good luck!
Time to try it out!
god ***
wouldn't work
wait no
tell me
I have an idea
remove the , after the numbers and add a "then" after them
Also thanks a LOT for that! That does really help!
Errors like?
I pasted it here to be used :)
but thats the jist of it
-wanna steal but not a dick-
there are a few errors your going to have to fix
https://hastebin.com/edekiwahis.lua here you go <@244660325905989632>
ok
meh
Yeah. I figured it out.
You might be confusing the mechanic that Keeper has with hearts being replaced by blue flies, <@267112861921181697>
who?
Keeper does something similar
I'm pretty sure a character does that
ok then what about an item which will sometimes spawn a blue fly when you pick up coins
thanks!
yeah, no problam
<@150336707609231362> Can you help me make some passives when your done with Serrix?
hang on, I'll write soem code for you to look at
Like, where the ifs are, <@150336707609231362> ?
unless jacobsmob helps but he is already doing shit
dammit
on death i mean
I cant really do tear stuff
well then what about an item that will let enemies sometimes shoot 3 tears in bullets in random directions that posion enemies on contact
use a for loop
Hm?
but there is a simpler way you could do it without all the copy paste
I need another passive
I have 2 actives and 1 passiv
needs to be rNumb=math.random
there's the prize orbs
Also I want passive itekm
Like, if you've played Smash Bros.
that's different
nononono
prize bombs, already a thing
Hopin' your new room code part works here
okay what about an active item that spawns a bomb entity that explodes after few seconds and drops a random trinket
And welcome back, <@!194259969359478784>
https://hastebin.com/ujabosefaq.php How's that look?
now you can d4
cool
hardcoded holy mantle for the lost
ayy my mod is done!
I need passive item ideas
i'm gonna continue
after that
Hey guys, can you give me some probably easy to code ideas?
alright i'm gonna go play portal 2 with someone for a bit
sry
yeah
oh
its in the item display
its on the hidden hud
Its supposed to be
looks a bit transparent...
your welcome Sunx
you helped me, so you're smarter than me at least
there are uses to not having to worry about Devil Deals
thank
it worked
dont think like that!
so honest
?
I cant really do that, i am not smart enough
it forces devil rooms to always give red chests or black hearts
Removes the rooms I mean
maybe like
no, That's Eurcarist
not rooms
he said deals
that would be awesome
does is garentee Angel rooms?
of course
Would anyone use an item that disables Devil Deals?
it is
Change the bit depth to 32 bit
thats not good
hmm
this happened
we replaced an items collectible sprite

and no, math.random is not conistant
And I still am worrying, so I'm just going with the set number first. Thanks for puttin' up with the trouble though!
would anyone choose an item the disables devil deals?
yeah, you got it actually
My issue was thinking that maybe the first math.random would fuddle it
Yep
so then ifrNumb=1 then spawn wrath, ifrNumb=2 spawn Death ect
Methinks I'll cut out the 1-3 and just set it to spawn maybe two or maybe three flies always.
so cute
xD thanks
1-5 determines if a Wrath, Death, Pestilence, Conquest, or Famine fly spawns.
Its beutiful
tortoise
<@266032468853915650> is that a turtle?
and you want the 1-5 to set what exactly?
eyy my transformation works
The 1-5 is for determining which fly spawns
Yes
the 1-3 will spawn 1-3 flies, correct?
Then I'm only bringing one math.random into the equation.
I guess? Do what you think you have to do then repost it.
Maybe I'll just make it simpler and have it spawn a set number of flies.
So from what I'm getting, I'm going to have to do it like this: math.random(1,3) into several following For rNumb = 1, math.random(1,5) and similar lines?
https://hastebin.com/oqidoxoqij.lua
kk
yes
serrix?
could you hastebin what you are doing so I can get a better glamps are what exactly you are doing?
Insanity is pretty fun to mess around with
time for the next item!
What about the first line, the math.random(1,3) for the number spawned?
Okay, I can make sense of that.
if you want random varients for each you are going to have to do if rNumb=1 then Isaac.Spawn(entity,varient1) end, and for the next varient do the same but replace 1 with 2
I'll take care of the fly spawn codes. I just need to know the order of ifs and the like
I dont know all the flie varients
I can fill in the spawn code for the flies, it's just the math.random syntax I need
Anyways, So, <@150336707609231362>, the syntax would be along the lines of what exactly, for the first math.random(1,3) for between 1-3 flies, then the math.random(1,5) for the ifs for each fly variant?
een with a sprite i dont know if it is possible
dunno
are the charges seperate?
strange. So if you want 5 charge items you need to make the sprite
there is no sprite for it
thats the reason you cant have 5 charge items
yeah for the bar. but I mean the charges in the bar
weird huh?
I believe there's actually sprites, yes.
ir reallz is a sprite
no?
nono
<@244660325905989632> I think the bar is a generated thing, not sprite
nop
do 5 charge items exist?
I mean that there actually isn't a meter for between 6 to 12 I think.
hmm
It worked with 6 charges
That's just my recollection though.
I think it just jumps from 6 to 12.
is there a nine charge item?
<@267112861921181697> pics please?
I don't think there is.
Is there an 8-charge item?
Guys, for some reason when I get my active item my charge bar isn't split into sections and it takes 5 charges to fill while I put in 8. is this a bug?
its no problam dude :D
Oh wow, that simplifies it a lot more. Thanks!
if you dont want 0 to be an option then do math.random(1,5)
so then for the first use it in the for loop For i=0, math.random(5) do-- this will randomly pick a number between 0-5 and do it that many times
Considering making a reskin for a bunch of existing items
Are there any items you guys think have bad sprites or are too similiar to each other?
Well the first math.random would simply for the number of flies spawned. Then more math.randoms to determine what flies are spawned
so rNumb=math.random(3) if rNum==0 then --do thing end
if you want differnt effect for each number, yes
Er, each return number
Would I then do proceeding if statements for each number?
I didn't want ot make it look like a diliruim item so i made it red
not the best but it will do for now
Here
<@244660325905989632>  math.random returns  a random number, for that the return would be a number between 0-3
I'm just gonna edit infamy for the item sprite
Anyways, <@112975821186031616>, I don't quite understand how the syntax for math.random-ing into a different math.random-ing works. https://hastebin.com/oqidoxoqij.lua is as far as I've got, I don't quite know how to write in the rest here.
sounds good to me
so eight room charge ok?
that's totally me when I am driving
^
I too get confused when I burn
It burns then confuses
lol
Not that I know of, I believe it's only one at a time.
make it trigger whenever you don't pick up a black heart
Can you apply mutliple effects to a boss at once?
It honestly doesn't seem that powerful to me, so.
well, it doesn't even get a boss to half health
should I increase it to twelve room charge?
That's like asking what's the point of getting Mom's Heels when Brimstone allows more damage. The game doesn't even *try* to keep itself balanced in the first place.
Confusion lasts a little longer than the other effects
What's the point of giving confusion and fear if freeze just stops them in place?
This clears up everything, thank you so much!
Yeah Markus, my only confusion stemmed from me not knowing how the function fetched these values
It also darkens the room for a while
I made a new active item called Insanity. What it does is it gives burning, poison, confusion, freeze, and fear to all enemies in the room for four seconds, and it has an 8 room charge.
If you wanted to find out if somethting was a small black fly, you could do something like

if dmg_target.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_FLY
Wow, thanks a lot!
Bah, beat me to it.
<@70946604139425792> It appears to be passing the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG parameters to the function.
```
Callback is a method that takes (TookDamage : Entity, DamageAmount : number, DamageFlag : number (bit flags from DamageFlag enumeration), DamageSource : EntityRef, DamageCountdownFrames : number)```
The callback MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE takes that information and gives it to the function.
the game in 60 i thought
thought it was longer hoenslty
animations run in 30 fps
???
the game runs at 30 fps lol
How does it know that I, for example, hit a fly with my tear
I know that much, but I'm trying to wrap my head around it; obviously the function is written out assuming that it knows the target, damage amount, the source of the damage, and the damage dealer, but how does the function fetch these values?
All you need to know is that the callback feeds dmg_dealer because the function call is written as: 

changemonstertears:update(dmg_target, dmg_amount, dmg_source, dmg_dealer)
dmg_dealer is one of the imput variables made in the fuction call
60 frames a second, so five seconds would be 300
I'm guessing frames.
frames
https://hastebin.com/awaniwocop.lua In this mod, there's a string that reads `if dmg_dealer.Type == EntityType.ENTITY.TEAR`, but I don't see dmg_dealer defined anywhere in this example before the if statement. How can this if statement ever read correctly if dmg_dealer is never defined? I'm confused
Do we know what it mean by time yet? Secends, frames, ticks?
its in hothead
1.0 is damage
120 is time
AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
Like charmed or stunned
Are you saying on hit apply an effect to a mob?
Wanna know what the item does?
Share it, <@70946604139425792>.
thanks Alzarath
Perfect@
Hey everyone, I'm looking at a workshop mod to figure out how the heck to do on-hit tear effects in a proper manner, and something in this one really confused me; I want to see if someone here can tell me how this mod can possibly work correctly
testing rn
Timeout probably means the time till is turns bright again
You'd have to test it.
Yeah, I'm guessing darkness is the intensity. A float. Probably 0-1.
So yea
darkness, timeout it says
Should just be `Game():Darken(<intensity>, <duration>)`, right?
its more for special effects than anything
Hate to ask, but does anyone know how to use Darken()
This is my first foray into lua coding, so I still get easily confused by the order of syntax and the like here.
Not quite sure what the syntax would be there, then.
Another math.random and set the variant with that, then?
Right, but it's gotta randomly choose one out of five attack fly variants
*problam
the main probably is goign to be knowing the entities in the room that are your chamipon
Should just be able to math.random(3) and spawn a fly that many times, right <@244660325905989632>?
I'll see what I can do and get back to you to help
like i don't even know how to start adding a new variant
Not anymore sorry
Do you still have your color code? I'd like to see what you came up with.
Don't know the coding for generating a number between 1 and 3, and applying it to spawn random certain fly variants.
rip
Looks like they went offline, darn.
eh. I messed up though becase I didnt know how to change colour quite yet. Its probably possible though
and how did it work out? <@150336707609231362>
How's it goin' there, <@162156525337575425> ?
I've tried to dip my hand into making new champions
I haven't exactly worked with these tools, but it should be possible to change entity colors and modify their attributes. Don't know how much work it'd take, but I'm sure you could make units spawn from them and set its tear rate so it doesn't fire. Dunno if you could make it integrate as seamlessly as other variants, though.
i planned on making a host variant that spits out attackspiders instead of tears
Well what exactly do you want the new variant to do?
seems like it's not possible at the moment to me
is there a way of creating new enemy variants?
Back in my day we had to edit the animations through XML by hand!
true
At least you have an animation editor!
not a literal button
I mean it has no undo functionality
control z
crrl Z?
this is actually the worst
Euch, why does animation editor not have an undo button
ty
ok
delete update.it
Remove the new update file in your mod's root folder.
what should i do when the game is saying my mod was old? i have the correct version number
Hm. This makes things difficult. Having HolyMantle's effect doesn't seem to proc MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG.
Where are flags used again? In the Callbacks, right?
but whatever
yeah right?
What a weird character for it to be bound to.
?
ah, close enough
german
I assume your using a Spanish oriented keyboard
Np ?
thank you dude
QWERTY
wow
Are you using a US keyboard layout?

doesn't work although i have multiple mods installed...
on the reddit
Oh shame
anyone know how the fuck costunes work?
modded item
Whats Butter
Below escape
Lower-case tilde.
which key does open the in game console?
Anyway, now I am trying to figure out how to make insanity do two good things and two bad things. You know, its insanity.
I realized earlier that the item woudlnt make sense because it is useless and would only take up more memory, so I ditched it, I noticed the chat was dead and tried to revive it.
And I've only been here to witness it for 2 days.
You've been begging for help all day for the past 2 days.
No it wasn't.
i know, it was ironicism
Not everyone has answers, and we can't come to your beck and call 24/7.
h e l p
Wow, butter + experimental treatment is bonkers
no
Is the Antibirth api public yet?
What the fuck is a backdrop
stupid fucking doc
I know the first number is how many frames it lasts for and the second just says "Hallucination Backdrop"
<@266141401824100362> still not as infinite as using Smelter with Missing Poster
No idea, I'll look at the doc and then type no idea again in 5mins
Markus, do you know how to use showhalluncination? the doc is really bad at explaining the params
lol
#balanced
So if butter spawned an item for every time it removed one, you'd end up with 81 lives after a single buttering.
<@244660325905989632> lemme see
l a z y
One for each extra life.
Turns out, dead cat has multiple copies of itself in your inventory that're invisible.
I foudn this video on youtuuuube
<@162156525337575425>
Welp. I fixed a dead cat bug that you guys'll find fun.
What do I do for ShowHallucination
<@162156525337575425> https://hastebin.com/ronuhesufu.lua This is what I've got so far, the issue being I'm not quite sure what the code will be for that number generating. I'm guessing we can't stack favor into one type right now, so I can disregard that.  So just need the number gen and making it spawn randomly from the pool of five Locust types.
Wish the documentation's search was better.
I'll have to try it tomorrow...
and spawn some flies
generate a number between 1 and 3
does detecting "you've run out of health, revive" work?
so check if its a new room
can we actually give isaac more lives right now?
I have a bit of code contributed by someone earlier for the discovering a new room part already.
Of the Locust variants, yes. But stacked more in favor for the weaker ones since one of the Locust flies is kind of really highly-damaging.
I think you have nine nine lives items while you have nine lives.
Nine lives is fucking weird.
so in each new room, it spawns 1-3 random flies?
Would you like to know what I just found out?
Guys.
<@162156525337575425> Mind helping me figure out one more part or so? It gets a bit more complicated here. Basically, I have the other effect of this item being that when a new room is discovered, it'll spawn between 1-3 flies with a random chance between any of the five Locust fly types, but stacked more in favor of certain ones. I can nix the between 1-3 part and make it a set amount if it's any simpler.
when you want to make a mod to replace tammy's head with 8 mega blast shots instead
the game wasn't made in lua
none of it is written in lua
no
is rebirth item code available in the resource folder?
what the hell am I supposed to type there lmao
it just says "Backdrop"
Documentation is shit
you're welcome
blame documentation
Thanks a lot there.
Well gosh dang.
Frankly I have no idea what I'm doing, haha.
```lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_FAMILIAR, FamiliarVariant.BLUE_FLY, LocustSubtypes.LOCUST_OF_WRATH, player.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
```
Nope.
<@244660325905989632> did you figure out the locusts yet?
That thing looks dangerous.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/267353315073982465/267501473724628992/unknown.png
i give up idk what to do
I wouldn't call it risky. Just don't go re-rolling items you want.
Good if you want to reroll it
It is rather clever.
and risky
Sounds neat
o

It removes an item from Isaac and places it in the room.
I saw that item on workshop

is there a way to check if an entity is dead?
I tried using it as a string, putting png after it,
is there a way to check if an entity is dead?
I have no idea what to do here
confused
beacause they share the same ID
say how would you refer to a variant of an enemy? like a pale fatty for example
ill leave that to you to figure out
The second syntax is "hallucination backdrop"
``ShowHallucination(300, 17_blue secret)`` how come this doesn't work?
Time to try a brute force approach
I know the Locust subtypes, but I don't know what the Variant code would be to make it a Locust fly in the first place.
gimme a sec
you didnt?
There's an issue in and of itself ?
Now to figure out how to make it be the Locust versions.
I am gonna make a troll item called Pure Insanity that has one charge that gives you a 5 second halluncination
But the issue I thought was that it describes it as an enemy.
ha
...I saw that as soon as you said it.
ENTITY_ATTACKFLY?
umm
Time to make Isaac a horror game.
ShowHallucination()
woag
The EntityType list doesn't seem to have them.
Guh, I can't find the spawn code for attack flies.
I'll check it out, <@171044322781691904>. Thanks for the info.
Not aware of anything for the moment.
not creating a room, I mean just creating an Ambush in the current room
<@112975821186031616> Theres a mod in the workshop my by the official devs that gives a shield
Hm, really? That's a shame.
and I can't use flags because that's the problem in itself
<@112975821186031616> there's no indicator for when you pick up an item
As far as I know, I haven't seen anyone that's created a room.
I checked the doc but it doesn't say anything
I want to create a spacebar item that does that so you can get coins if needed
Maybe you could keep track of how many times you pick up the item, <@134478547795443712>.
<@134478547795443712> is it possible to create an Ambush like in trap rooms?
Anyone have a workaround to let you gain stats twice with a duplicate of a passive item?
I imagine MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG is what you're looking for, <@171044322781691904>. If you want to prevent damage to yourself, well, if you find out how, tell me. I'm having trouble finding that myself.
i showed my directory there
look in <#267353315073982465>
figured...
also
its enabled
rooms where if you pick up an pickup or something enemies spawn?
is there an eazy way to do collision detection?
rooms where if you pick up an pickup or something enemies spawn?
Getters don't generally let you create things.
Trap rooms
What's an ambush?
Make sure you have the right directory and your mod is enabled, then.
could I use getambush() to create an ambush
Wait
i did
<@166249905772429312> I believe you need to restart the game for visual modifications.
ok lol. I thought it could have been referring to PositionX
Oh I was?
What does ``AddDevilRoomDeal`` do?
you were right
yeah

maybe thats it
what
it didn't do shit
heeeeeelp
error*
Why is it doing this eror
main.lua:74: attempt to index a number value (global 'current_target')
Now to think of ideas for my next item...
that means gfx/items/pickups or whatever
alright
If you simply want to replace some visual aspect, yes, all you'd need to do is place the new sprite in the same directory structure as the old one.
inside the folder in gfx do i just put the replacement sprite
<@166249905772429312> There are plenty of video tutorials on Youtube to get you started by now.
first name should be same
i don't know how to make a test mod
i haven't tried it yet but I think that's how you do it
put the graphic of the object with the name name in the gtx folder I believe
Okay so, these subtypes would go into the third section of a Spawn() command, yes? https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/group___enumerations.html#gad9b31a86785e32c18d5d5487a31a0e1f
could anyone tell me how to replace the graphic for a specific item
There's an edit command. it's easily accessed via hitting the up arrow on your keyboard or by right-clicking/tap-holding your message.
sorry for wasting your lives
yayyyy
I can work on some MORE ACTIVE ITEMS
well.
well;
ok
This is also why consistent capitalization helps. Nudge nudge. `use_puzzlecube`.
modded items have to be capitalized when typing in the console.
This is also why consistent capitalization help. Nudge nudge. `use_puzzlecube`.
modded items have to be capitalized when typing in the console.
now we know
WEEEELLLLLLL
Yeah.
Whoops.
Who was lazy and didn't cap in the console
turns out I was a fucking retard
I didn't capitalize Puzzle Cube when typing it in the console o^o and getting rid of the end merged the scripts making it so the item didn't work, so I put the end back to see the issue, typed the ID instead of the words, and boom
just say "oh I found the problem" and then tell us what it was
we've asked several times
can you *please* stop with the multiline rants
That tends to be the feeling when you spend 2 hours trying to find a mistake just to realize it was an unrelated error at the top of the script that was breaking *everything*.
You can stop talking like that
GuEeS wHaT
I w a n t t o f u c k I n g d I e
I r e a l I z e d m y m I s t a k e
o h m y g o d
ok I honeslty haven't played much antibirth
oh
ya
antibirth?
Whats 120 volt?
bootleg 120 volt tbh
oh sorry
Jacob's Ladder was a pretty neat item, but that seems more for general chat.
btw am I the only person who fucking loves Jacobs ladder as an item
There's a subsection for the Locust variants, but I'm not sure if just using that works.
I can't seem to find attack flies in that
Check in the docs for the entity type?
Someone mind helping me figure out how to spawn Locust attack flies? And a different line for spawning them with stacked chances for certain ones over others?
_oh_
I don't know what I did
it worked
oh
cool
oh
For what? Reloading the mod? You can just run `luamod <mod name>` in the console.
would save a shitload of time
I wish there was a restart game command in the console
Not entirely sure how that would hurt things.
Probably
I'm not actually convinced it *was* the problem. It looks like removing it might have just merged his PostUpdate with his use_puzzlecube functions.
I don't even know
That's the weird part, to be honest. My editor didn't even notice an extra `end` when I pasted his code in.
honestly just get a text editor with a lua linter
See the own issues in your script
You won't learn anything if you let people fish for you 24/7, you have to learn to fish for yourself
How much time have you spent getting one issue fixed by chat intervention, only to run into another immediately and then ask chat again
I am just seeing if anyone else can get it before me, y'know
I am
You should really try to troubleshoot by yourself for a change
And then you can fix the horrific code that looks like it got caught in a virtual trash compactor.
now for functionality
for "fixed" item
https://hastebin.com/rumotuseli.lua
new hastebin
What do you have?
Okay now. Back to this, so, frankly I have no idea how to make this item spawn the Locust attack flies.
I know
Remove the update.tt file in the mod folder.
gonna assume that doesn't work then
Now its [old]
I moved the callback to where it was originally, lets see if that has any effect
^
Progress.
now it just doesn't work
the cube can now be obtained
Well
That's why proper indentation is important
the first one indented all the way to the left
Which one was the extra one?
I was also awfully stupid
I WAS RIGHT
YES
I also was counting ends
I had this stupid issue all the time in Terraria modding
That's what I was looking for, maybe I missed one on my pass.
I put too many ends
THAT'S NICE
I THINK I KNOW WHATS WRONG
WAIT
because the function ends there anyway
yeah that return doesn't actually do anything
reset the trigger so that the code can run again\
what's the point of line 38
Doubt it'd have any impact, but you are mixing tabs and spaces. Maybe try making those consistent.
aka first callback
line 44 nil value
what's your error?
I cant figure out whats wrong
lua is best language ?
The semi-colons disgust me. At least put them on everything if you're gonna be that way!
I don't remember putting semicolons
the semicolons are cute
yes,  it works completely fine
But the first one's working, right? Hm.
that's what its saying, a nil value, but it doesn't have any values to be nil
oh I thought you meant you were trying to acquire an item in-game
Could be part of your PostUpdate function, maybe.
https://hastebin.com/iqawiropak.lua second item
oops
MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate )
what item
He is making them for someone else's mod, so I'd be careful about using them.
I trried everything but I cannot get this item goddamnit
yep
in dm
can you send me the axes youve made so far
<@!188945290923868161>
?
Games didn't have transparency on old consoles!
Button
but?
butt
ROBOBABS PLS
butt
the blur isnt transparent
looks nice but
i would show that off in <#267353315073982465>
yes
<@!188945290923868161>
It's a banana axe.
enjoy!
neat
oh
Huh
did you know that saying melon on club penguin gets you banned
<@!188945290923868161> we have a <#267353315073982465> channel now
but not most
a couple specific items directly reduce the delay

most things follow the formula of modifying how many tears are to be shot per second

m e l o n
I'm pretty sure it's right
I mean this makes sense
(This is literally what I've been told by every person I've ever talked to about this, if I'm wrong please correct me)
where did this conversation even start
when you pick up the sad onion no lua code is ran because its not written in lua
when you pick up the sad onion?
the lua code runs the formula to figure out the actual tear delay change
There's tear delay, and that's it
Like, these charts about fire rate etc. are meant for player reference, not modder reference
so in actuality
"Tears Up" is a stat calculated external to the game, the game only keeps track of the delay between tears
theres only a tear delay stat tho so
but that's not the same as 2 tears up
cancer is -2 tear delay
but that's not the same as -0.7 tear delay
the sad onion is .7 tears up
through a formula
but one is calculated using the other
yes, they trend together
How is this ``MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate )`` using a nil value?
Tears Up is a tear delay down
it's formulaic
i still do not know whats a plumbus is tho
Tears Up isn't equivalent to Tear Delay though
And why when you pick up any tears-up, you see a tear delay down on missinghud
it really bothered me reading plumbus and not seeing thatpink lovely thing
Which is why tear delay is the only stat covered in missinghud
If you haven't changed your script, that would be your first callback, <@267112861921181697>.
lol why do you denote code that way
<@116386733905412105> There's no such thing as a "fire rate" stat IIRC, tear delay is the only stat
nice
im proud of you
<@109624258317033472> yeah this was my twitter/steam pic, just thought I'd be consistent
it's why Cancer's -2 Tears Delay doesn't equate to any specific Tears Up value
``[INFO] - Running Lua Script: C:\Users\User/Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/ascension/main.lua
[INFO] - ERR: ...mes/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/ascension/main.lua:44: attempt to call a nil value
[INFO] - There was an error running the lua file: C:\Users\User/Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/ascension/main.lua
[INFO] - Loading GameState 1 from SteamCloud!``
welp. I found the issue
Make sure you check toward the very bottom
I mean one is used to calculate the other
http://bindingofisaac.wikia.com/wiki/Stats/Tears
What do you mean
The shorter the delay, the "higher" your tears stat
it's not the actual tears stat
<@134478547795443712> FINALLY you got the correct profile pic
Tear delay is the delay between your tear firing
The letters are a few pixels larger
<@116386733905412105> I'm pretty sure tear delay *is* the actual tear stat
how does it fill the chat?
Just refrain
<@267112861921181697>  I don't care if it's ironic, it's annoying and it fills up the chat.
I checked and there were no erroes. Ill check again to see if I missed something
why do we have access to tears Delay but not to the actual Tears stat?
I don't know how Windows users watch files, though.
But yeah, log.txt.
anyway
I used caps lock ironically before and people flipped their shit.\
I don't think anyone was going to say anything like that.
Someone was gonna be like "OoH y O u  used CAPS LOICK u MEANIE"
that info even was stickied in the isaac reddit :p
I think we get it.
xD
angry*
not really angery
caps for ironic effect
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I STRESSED RUNNING I DID TO GET AWAY FROM THEM FUCKKERS?
Jesus, this whole time I took so much damage out of fear.
my whole life has been a lie
What? Really?
Should be a folder called `Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+` in your My Documents or wherever folder your mods folder is. In there you can watch the file `log.txt`.
I just learned that stone fatties don't do contact damage\
holy shit
Is there a way that I could troubleshoot, or something? There are no mods that add more than one item that use main.lua on the workshop, or at least trustworthy mods.
kk
if nobody's answered when you've spammed the same question for 20 minutes it's probably because either nobody knows or they are all busy
actual mental breakdown
Ill get some coffee
tired, that's all.
appolofie
endershot remember the argument we had earlier
Can you not
p
ps
pls
please
Guys help the second item (after the first callback) exists but I cannot obtain it in any way, such as console https://hastebin.com/iqawiropak.lua
I haven't figured it out from the API doc yet and I'm too confused to check, what sort of information do position checks give you? It's not like, X and Y coords is it
I got rid of the ID but the puzzle cube still isn't working
--NEW ROOM
where the comment is
So, I'm assuming add a spawn somewhere in the function you provided for me, <@!194259969359478784>
why is player.Position wrong
nOO
no
Mod your cat to fire brimstone
lol
help
my cat is sitting right next to my hea
So it's gotta decide between say 1-3 flies, then which ones since there's five I'm trying to have it decide between, but also stack the chance more towards certain kinds.
I want it to spawn a variable number of Locust flies upon entering a newly discovered room.
serrix depends on what you want to happen when you enter a room
its just a buggy nightmare
not percent
nor 0 to 255
its neither 0 to 1
seriously. what the fuck
has anyone gotten entity:setcolor to work Corecctly?
am i reallz that fucking retarded
Should I have the function replace "for i, entity in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do", or should I remove that part entirely and place this elsewhere?
probably
I think it was contributing to the issue, though.
aww
fuck
it didn't work
and no
Oh right then.
no that was to ender
<@134478547795443712> So I should remove the "local oID = 0" part, or more than that?
k
not dumb
I know
second item
*third
in the second line
maxcharges="3" anywhere
after which tag?
Where do I put max charges
stop
lightbulb moment right there
OH SHIT
MAXCHARGES
CHARGES
just remove the id part
OH
don't use ids
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Heroes never die!" gfx="Healthcare.png" id="929" name="Healthcare" />
    <active description="The old enigma, is it even possible to solve?" gfx="Cube.png" id="930" name="Puzzle Cube" />
</items>
plumbus I know It isn't working though
and put the rest inside your update function
You can merge two items into one file
Don't mention someone if you don't need their attention, though, it can get annoying fast
put the `local oID = 0` at the top of your code
umm*
Right, forgot 'bout that
up
oh, <@244660325905989632> use the @ symbol to mention someone
I am honeslty lost as fuck on what to do now, if I cant merge two items into one file I cant really make a good mod.
Anyways, where would I put that tidbit of new room checking code you put, !epicbob57?
Thanks
and doesn't embed
Ah, righto then
much faster
For the future, use hastebin.com
Sorry 'bout that, also sort of new to discord
Whup
So http://pastebin.com/Vcv0Aa5p there's the current code I have, literally just the tutorial I followed minus changing out the item's code name. I intend on making it spawn one of each of the Locust flies on pickup, then spawn a few of the flies randomly from any of the trinkets. However, preferably with stacked chances for some of them, seeing as one of them has a lot of power behind it.
does it perhaps only work in dark rooms?
probably broken then
it doesn't work tho
like no shit
makes a glow around the player
hmm ender
again, anyone know what player:RenderGlow(player.Position) does?
I made two mods, Puzzle cube which is basically a weaker Eden's soul, No <@!194259969359478784>, and also Healthcare which gives you health upon entering certain rooms.
any errors in the log?
```<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Heroes never die!" gfx="Healthcare.png" id="929" name="Healthcare" />
    <active description="The old enigma, is it even possible to solve?" gfx="Cube.png" id="930" name="Puzzle Cube" />
</items>
```
All five trinkets in one item, but spawning them a bit differently.
ah, cool
sure
Can I post it directly to chat? its only four lines
My item is intended to sort of be a conglomeration of the Locust trinkets that Apollyon unlocks in Afterbirth+
Room first visit works as it should
can you share items.xml
Nope.
like hold it?
does Room.IsFirstVisit () not do what I'd expect it to then?
what do you mean bob
and can you get the item?
What mod are you making?
are you sure the item ID is right
Oh, I joined yesterday. ha.
Posting again (not sure if nobody noticed or something) https://hastebin.com/iqawiropak.lua for some reason the Puzzle cube (second half) exists, but wont spawn. Does anyone know a potential reason and fix?
Probably not, kinda new here. Popped in some minutes ago after following Lytebringr's passive item tutorial, now trying to deviate from that sorta template into my own thing.
```Lua

local oID = 0
function mod:update()
    local cID = Game():GetRoom().GetDecorationSeed(Game():GetRoom())
    if cID ~= oID then
        oID = cID
        --NEW ROOM!
    end
end```
I don t think we have met
Hey serrix
it's hacky
i just figured that out
yes
First off, is it possible to have a passive item spawn something for every newly discovered room? Like, entering a room you haven't been in before?
```Lua
player:RenderGlow(player.Position)```
how should this work
Workin' on a lil' one-item mod here, tryin' to figure things out since it's my first foray into something like this.
Heyo everyone.
like, how to make a temporary costume
now i just need to figure out costumes
great, working
brb
may be helpful to put all this into a wrapper function
kek
_tfw you forget to reload  your mod and your game crashs_
thanks
removing it after it works
yes I did
```lua
    local sound = Isaac.Spawn(0, 0, 0, Vector(0, 0), Vector(0, 0), player)
    sound:ToNPC():PlaySound(55, 100, 0, false, 1)
    sound:Remove()
```
yay
Dunno if it matters, but have you tried putting both callbacks at the bottom?
<@!194259969359478784> i figured it out
it shows up when I type it, but it doesn't spawn.
yeah
did you give it an xml entry
please
for some reason Healthcare works perfectly fine but Puzzle Cube doesn't even spawn when I type in the command.
https://hastebin.com/iqawiropak.lua
smh help
I am trying to add more than one item, puzzle cube is not working (wont spawn) but Healthcare is fnie
i'll try with a different entity
lemme try something
[INFO] - config for entity 0.0 is missing
tried without the ToNPC(), same result
just guesing
lmao just picks it?
idk
nothing else
picks a target
what does this do

yeah
well thats progress atleast!?
played the sound, also crashed the game :)
```lua
Isaac.Spawn(0,0,0,player.Position,player.Velocity,player):ToNPC():PlaySound(55,100,0,false,1)
```
try
```Lua
Isaac:Spawn(0,0,0,player.Position,player.Velocity,player).PlaySound(55,100,0,false,1)
```
What's the problem here
it won't hurt, anyway
It's still good practice to put local
It wouldn't matter though because thers only one file
but I was told not to make them local
you dint put local
Whats wrong with those <@266032468853915650>
but how do i fix that?
WHAT my mistake never was the color. i fucked up in the anm2 
[INFO] - [warn] No OverlayEffect Null found for Entity PacmanGhost with sprite gfx/Pacman_Ghost.anm2
local validroom = false
local trigger = false
please
Would this work? https://hastebin.com/asagemepeh.lua
wow
yeah
wait seriously?
not 0-255
Color is 0-1
Color() is  a mystery to me. it alway comes out as plain white. wtf
anybody got any ideas for new axe synergies?
make sure its an EntityNPC tho
ok
So uh
<@132691314784337920> Pretty cool man
yeah do that probs
spawn an invisible entity, play the sound from it
and there's nothing else
¯\_(?)_/¯
then what if it's an empty room
not in my experience atleast
nope... player doesnt work
player works?
it's not implausible that there's a way to include additional lua files but I don't know what it is
it needs to be called on an entity
portal it says attempt to call a nil field
that's the question
yes
i think 0 doesnt work
<@132691314784337920> didnt you make the Quark mod for minecraft
try having 1 last the last argument
why?!
or not
can I make another main lua
EntityNPC.PlaySound(55,100,0,false,0)
now I'm going to bed because that took a while
how to use
Most editors can collapse the functions
I made a thing
https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/817911159265300481
<@!194259969359478784> be more specific
You can work around that though
and yeah, it will get abit cluttered
this is why I was asking which you meant :v
lua
ed
yes I am so retard
ok bois i'm back
main.lua you mean?
you mean Main.lua
I mean, that if I put every item in Main.xml, its gonna get cluttered real fucking quick, so can I make a main2.xml to keep it nice and organized, or does all of the item's codes need to be in main.xml
anyone know `PlaySound` usage
because they're different things
are you talking about xml files or lua files endershot
blurp != blorp
i'm 90% sure the same file names don't work
You just add another item line to your content/items.xml. I don't know what you're asking.
```xml
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Blurp" gfx="blurp.png" name="Item 1"/>
    <passive description="Blorp" gfx="blorp.png" name="Item 2"/>
</items>
```
another Main* xml
So I can make another XML, but not another items.xml?
No, same items.xml file. Just add another item line.
So can I make another XML or does everything need to be in main.lua
The... same way you make one item in a mod, but twice.
add two lines to items.xml
First off how the fuck do I have two items in one mod
ModCallbacks.MC_USE_CARD
time wasted
smh
?
wait so card pickup works <@267112861921181697>
yeah bob looks fine
How do I do things when my card is used?

I think I have gotten it looks good?
Hm.
I had to define an ID to get my texture to work
in thw documentation it's a combination of id and name
Well, at least with regular items, IDs are automatically assigned.
What?
<@267112861921181697> I don't believe you want to define an ID.
oke
255
are colors  from 0 to 255 or from 0 to 1 ?
or do callbacks always go at the end of the file
Do I write code after the callbacks?
that would be main.lua
yes
the code that defines what it does
>normal code
?
Do I put the normal code in the main.lua folder then
idk how to define the hud elsewhere though
looks right to me
<@!194259969359478784> Please ``<pocketitems> 
    <card description="Fulfil your addiction" hud="GoldenGreed" id="52" name="Golden Greed" />
</pocketitems>``
Just wanted to see how it looked if looked more like the void
somone make a mod where every texture has the noir filter
Thought so
second
second


Opinion needed which one is better?
two half hearts yes
and restores just two red hearts from my memory
I think five?
yum heart requires how many bars again
more than Yum Heart
check doc
is there a HasTrinket
hm
if there was an item that restored a third of your health, and upgraded variants that restore two third and a whole how many green bars do you think they should cost to activate
i was thinking three, five and seven respectively
you
me or the other one
is my code ok
Bob
for integers
use `floor()` tho
ah
sure
Check the health and devide by three, add health by that much
or percantages at all
alright i have a question
is it possible to make an item that restores a third of your maximum red heart hp
Yeah sorry
maybe UBER look it up
hud="GoldenGreed.png" right?
isnt it math:random()
would this work for the pocketitems file?
``<pocketitems> 
    <card description="Fulfil your addiction" hud="GoldenGreed" id="52" name="Golden Greed" />
</pocketitems>``
if you find an actual random() function
list[random(#list)] would work
and damages enemies when they make contact with it
idk
<@!194259969359478784>
choose random value from a list?
is there a random.choice()
while control switches over to a small tornado that can go over and through objects
5000 million times
oh yeah i had an idea for my mod
it's an item that you have to activate
when you activate it isaac becomes invincible for a while and becomes immobile
no need to type len()
THAT IS GREAT
yup
it will return 4?
so if a list is like (1, 2, 3, 4,)
lua is ok
yup
that is actually pretty cool
put the # in front of the thing you want the length of
Pretty hard to a hurrican damn
unless GMS and CSS count but those are super basic
i'm probably an idiot for wanting to make a mod but having no experience with any programming language
do #list <@171044322781691904>
Hurricane Isaac came out ok
?
is there len() in lua
was just adding to the list
I know
"i never said the official games weren't guilty of that either"

i never said the official games weren't guilty of that either

i don't see the point of making an item that's just another item but with a different name and look
alt f4

reupload the mod with the new image
Anybody know how to change the thumbnail image on a steam workshop page?
I made a puzzle cube that does the same thing as Edens soul
they haven't released any source code
that has no reason to pick over a leech
it's not that easy <@267112861921181697>
I just wanna do it for coding purposes
wouldn't that just make it basically a copy of leech
its ok
lmao
fuk theres an item
because that's what the leech does
Maybe give it the leech ai
has a chance to give the player hp
neat
well ima do so it latches onto ennemies and sucks their blood
Is it possible to edit any hud stuff?
does it follow you around
How does it work U B E R

Don't download it, don't let him have pride of what he does.

making a kingdom hearts mod for AB+
i thought of
so how would i put a holy mantle shield graphic on the player
<@171044322781691904> sorry, you need to use : not .
you need to put an entity in that is a familiar
hi there
don't I need to input a vector?
line*
line 51 is where the aria
<@109624258317033472> main.lua:51: bad argument #1 to 'FollowPosition' (EntityFamiliar expected, got Vector)
Any one know if Isaac.WorldToScreenPosition(vector,bool) is working ?
My mega mod is going to be called The Binding of Isaac: Ascension
No problem, considering I barely helped
npnp ^^
ty very much
thats smart actually
pos is the position and npc is the char
and you use npc.FollowPosition()
kk
ohhh
yeah
change pos and npc are things you put in
so it passes it down?
why do I have to put npc
nono
snippet from my code if that helps
like this?
<@171044322781691904> ```function pacmanMod:GhostUpdate(npc)
end
pacmanMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_NPC_UPDATE, pacmanMod.GhostUpdate, ghostEntity)```
adds half a soul heart to the player
AddSoulHeart(1) I mean
AddSpiritHeart(1)
and its ok
sasy
so just put the thing
rly
and put the intergers inside of the parenthesis
an EntityFamiliar gets passed to you in the FAMILIAR_UPDATE callback
just write them
?
sorry how do I use these
I figured that's what I mean
same name
you create your own Pokectitems.xml
nonono
How do I edit PocketItems.xml to make a new card? just add my own line?

cheers, let me check it out
<@132691314784337920> there is an thread on reddit about that
Pools aren't working at all right now if I'm not mistaken
That's my main issue
so I can test it
help getting it into the card pool
How does one give a costume from vanilla to the player?
then why do you need help? ?
i doubt its too hard
I know what to do and how to do it
never tried
not really i guess
can you help me get it set up?
pickupitems.xml
kind of
Do you know how to make a card?
then I dunno
variants are not for champion types tho ?
theres an entity;varient thing
which you can get from the player
you can get an config item from the temporary effect class
what do you pass for `Item`
i tried
anyone figured out `AddCostume (Config::Item Item, boolean ItemStateOnly)`
mKay
I dunno
does anyone know how to set the champion variant of an entity/enemy in code?
class
enum
Theres a getcardidbyname
I can just test it myself
good idea
actually
can you set a top bound
make it accelerate unitil a certain speed
hmmm
?
instead of stop and go
yeah but I don't want it to keep gaining speed
hey 
XV6T LPNZ
Tammy's head basement seed
and decelerate
that is
movement of an entity
you can make it accelerate
if I set position it feels chunky
is there any way to make movement look smooth?
and how to put it in the card pool
how to register it as a card and not something else
oh
code frame
frame? as in outline?
Can someone give me a frame to make a custom card? pls and thank
Shaaaame.
except for text
nope
Is it possible to draw things on the UI at the moment?
that would be good, I think
The 2 things that were the most important to me in AB+ were direct drawing to the game and key/mouse event callbacks

and i got neither
not too op but not horrible either
So just golden keys and bombs
Is there an EntityNPC that is always around
so that I can play a sound effect
oh ok
half gold hearts don't exist
that it's hurt
Maybe a half gold heart
but that's not obvious
actually yeah, probably would be fine
cause every pickup has an id
yeah
Is there an EntityNPC that is always present?
you can do the sad animation
I'd agree without the heart maybe
but you can work with existing id's at least that's what seems logical
or well, yeah
you can't fucking play the hurt animation rip
Ok ok Ender you go first im just gonna sprite this hurricane
unless obviously blank card
Only lasts one floor
not really
Wait what are we talkin about?
that's op
I just gives you a gold heart, golden bombs, and golden keys
no not the card i meant the hurricane xd
Since when do you need to animate a card
but what does it do?
A card?
Im gonna sprit it
that's difficult cause you need a new animation for it
I don't want to overwrite a card
I want my own  card
I am not really sure if its similar to any card
Hurricane Isaac item?
if it's kinda similar from an existing card you can try changing that
I got an idea for 12 room charge item
Yes
Yred
already know what you want it to do?
that does something when used
just a card
what kind of card?
I want to make cards
if you have a question i can try to answer
<@!120669965236830208> you alive
Spider Baby and Adult are the new transformation
You should ask <@!120669965236830208> with code he is very good I mean he helped us with the amzing item of the axe
i'm a coder
btw
no coders online
rip
only sprite
nope I not code
but i'll probably just start with changing an item charge
Just check for all the relevant items
Should be perfectly possible to make a transformation
<@!188945290923868161> I forget do you code
transformation*
maybe it'll be kinda cool to make a new transformarion
There can only be one Bob but you win this time only because your epic
Since they all work on similar logic
I have a great and kinda OP pill
Pretty much no matter what programming language you know it will be fairly simple to learn another
Please tell me how to make a pill
<@!188945290923868161> you're back
ninja'd
<@!194259969359478784> You win this time....
well i knew php first and it helped with learning c#
then it's probably fine to learn for me
php is completely different
similar to C#
is lua a lot different from php and c#?
but sadly I think you cant put them in the pill pool?
I could make a pill for the time being
k
probably possible too
idk about cards
pills are
I have a really good card idea
are cards and pills possible?
I have a question
Also true.
I had a good and easy to code active item idea but I forgot it fuck
Also works with bomb items and abbadon.
That too. Though not especially reliable.
or if you pick up a shitty item with curse of the blind ?
Also works with reroll machines
Could be useful in conjunction with the D6, I guess.
Oh, nevermind. I misread it.
How so?
Yikes, that's OP.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837433281
I will do that, thanks for the tip!
Doesn't seem they really have anything to do with eachother right now. If the Healthcare item is just there to make the game a little easier, maybe you should be placing it on a pedastal near them when they spawn.
You honestly should have known that jerbear
Ill make more items and grow on it.
?
you knjow what I mean
?
ofc
shit in a good way i mean
gl with your shit
>megamod
Cya tomorrow guys
For my mod
It was a good day today
Well
>two items
Guys should I combine my rubix cube and healthcare items together and make a mega mod?
I want to make another mod... but what?
and is x+ left or right?
as in, is y+ down or up?
?
how do the coordinates work in isaac
<@153294605025017856> thank you very much, this helps a lot ?
not really
if possible
it's easy to make it myself but I'd rather not duplicate code
is there any api method to get a Direction enum out of a direction Vector?
Hey guys, my mod is up! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837429529
try it out
doesnt really matter i guess
or the body/walk?
do I PlayOverlay the head
at a looping animation ofc
havent tried it ingame tho
because the editor preivew suggests otherwise, seems a bit hacky
also, since oyu seem to be familiar with the anm2 editor, are the transitions between the last and the first frame interpolated?
oooooh
in code Sprite:PlayOverlay("animname")
you can use a overlay animation
how do I play them both at once?
and HeadDown
Uploading mod
and it has two separate animations for WalkDown
when I'm using the player anm2
what do I do
ok so
uh
<@174505132292046849> This one covers the basics https://youtu.be/oIm8hhXgYlg
So that doesnt work
Im using Isaac.Spawn (entity...)
Hmmm
The thing in my mod allows you to gain the effects of any collectible item for the current room only
Hey there does someone know a tutorial or something like that about editing or even creating new animation files for custom enemies?
Do you know how can you do that in another way?
on Sprite
Play
nvm
It seems it doesnt work for my .Spawn thing
but, it wont let me
Hmm
<@132627275307810817> yep
you can. You just use the moduploader with the same mod
<@134478547795443712> you used GetEffects in your book mod so the familiars despawn after leaving the room right?
In a few days I will do it public
is there a better API to play animations than SetSpriteFrame?
Wait, can I not upload edited mods?!
<@267112861921181697> yes
I published the version 1.0 but it is only for friends
Is it currently possible to have more than one item per mod?
https://hastebin.com/jahidapeqe.lua
This is probably wrong. But is this correct for checking the entities?
nice
logo made x'D

I don't see anything about it...
yea guess they changed it
Did they update it?
nice
i kept the old ones too and was looking in those on accident
oh my fucking god im a dumbass lmao
how updated?
maybe they changed it
ye
do you have updated docs
portal
figured
you cant
or is that not possible
how do I add my item to item pools
oh huh
example `player.Position:Distance(something.Position)`
because you're supposed to call it with `:`, and that's just how it's called in the C++ code
it has two arguments
and
it's not static
I was right
http://i.imgur.com/fIIUpSM.png
¯\_(?)_/¯
http://i.imgur.com/abFmUX8.png\
<@162156525337575425> Vector.Distance is nil
much to everyone's dislike
it is static
oh
I have returned
Hey
why would it not be static when it takes two vectors
oh is it not static?
`Vector.Distance`
what
`attempt to call a nil value (field 'Distance')
`
i just did `for i, e in ipairs(entities) do`
and return an iterator function iirc
a table
they receive an argument
`pairs` and `ipairs` are iterators
What will be the term I use to refer to the entity inside the for loop
and `pairs` operates on it like a dictionary/hash in other languages
`ipairs` operates on tables with integer indexes starting from `1`
and then it uses item as the object
only tables
in lua there are no arrays
Ok hold up.
In python you can do for item in list do
but `i` = `index`, `k`= `key`, `v` = `value`
doesn't need to be
and `i, v` for ipairs
it should be `k, v` for pairs
actually
thanks
for i, v in pairs(Isaac.GetRoomEntities()) do
```
for i in Isaac.GetRoomEntities() do
```
does this work in lua
it puts it as [OLD] <@109624258317033472>
let me rerun
there wasn't even an id
uhh let me see
?
yeah
in the xml
ID 3 is familiar
it needs to be
also, is your entity of ID 3?
nope
any errors?
<@109624258317033472> This still doesn't work
for i in Isaac.GetRoomEntities() do
would this be correct syntax:
GG ?
and I normalized the wrong vector
it's past midnight
nvm sorry I'm dumb
for 1,#[name] do
yeah, you gotta loop through it
Can I go through it with a for loop?
<@126426442555719680> and does that return a table of the entities?
^
you can use * on the vector
or what  do you mean?
resize?
is there any method to denormalize a vector?
Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
GetRoomEntities()
what's the function to get all entities in the room?
is there any method to move an entity, or does setting Position respect collision?
it's a normal custom entity
my callback still doesn't work
<@109624258317033472> but it's not a "real" familiar
sorry
FAMILIAR_UPDATE
no
<@267415515138359297> if you call NPC_UPDATE to that familiar, it autmomaticly follows the player
<@109624258317033472> ok
i have 600 or so
no, definetly not xD
<@109624258317033472> uuh so no 0?
<@171044322781691904> but make sure the variant is unique, not similar to any other familiars
or can I just cast my custom entity to entityfamiliar?
I'll have to reimplement it though right?
jup.
hmmmm
got it
followparent in entityfamiliar
<@109624258317033472> so this?
not the entity type of familars
I vaguely remember something like that
what's the method to have the enemy move towards the parent?
you pass the variant of the familiar
What is wrong with my callback?
also, if you guys ever need to convert the xml file of a room to a lua code that would spawn all entities in that room, ask. Wrote that earlier today. only to find out that it was completely useless. fml
SquaredDistance is love
the perf impact was fucking huuge
I used Vector:Distance once to calcualte the distance between all entities. never again
?
glad to help ?
npnp ^^
Thanks <@109624258317033472> ! I was just starting one to learn basic lua ?
<@132691314784337920> Thank god, it's too late to be writing math
havent tried
this snippet might even work
<@267415515138359297> , yes, Vector:Distance
<@81035468866584576> https://hastebin.com/uretugufus.lua thats how you write a function. i really suggest looking some tutorials tho
ok
<@!194259969359478784> try to look into `AnimateX` methods in EntityPlayer
is there a method in the api to get the distance between two vectors?
Has anyone figured out how to fire a mom's knife properly? They always seem to despawn the tick they're shot
can we play player hurt animations
it's in the vectors
I'm an idiot
oh
apparently that's not where the error comes from?
huh
That's what i'm tryng to do ^^'
<@81035468866584576> uhhh, you might wanna copy and paste a mod fromthe workshop or learn a bit lua
good point
ooooooh
<@267415515138359297>  pass player as spawner
>Are custom transformations possible????
on the line of Isaac.Spawn
How can i do that <@109624258317033472> ?
(Noted, <@267415515138359297> will not make the error another time)
because I'm getting `nil passed to reference`
do you need to pass a spawner to Isaac.Spawn?
also, only 256 tears
back to my question
you need a function to call for the Callback
fun trivia, you can only have 64 mom's knives on screen
```
"Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". Please do not write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua" right!

Ok so... Trying to learn some Lua/undertanding things, i got this in the logs, any idea ?
```[ASSERT] - Player Manager must always have at least one player``` 
I wrote this : (who is surely wrong)
```local   mod = RegisterMod( "tbomv", 1 )
local costume = Isaac.GetCostumeIdByPath("gfx/characters/001.000_player.anm2")
Game():GetPlayer(0):AddNullCostume(costume)
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, mod.Update)```
Will this work?

well actually i haven't needed trig so far
do you *need* to pass in the spawner of an entity?
yeah they're rad
radians are so much better
yeah
need to convert all the time for trig
xD
ahh
Just using degrees at all is worth of -.-
i meant that i don't agree with using degrees
^
why  "-_-" ? ^^ its a valid question
degrees -_-
are angles in degrees or radians?
the docs descirptions are so bad
wait what ?
lol
lmao
no
what

Has anyone had problems with entities' velocity going to 0 instantly? Friction is set to one in entities2.xml
and static fields
static methods though
^
game = Game()
well but then your instance can't be Game
¯\_(?)_/¯
seems like a thing that'd be a single global instance
¯\_(?)_/¯
why though
Ah
it's : because you need a Game instance
:
just skimmed through the docs
I actually nver used it
or is it Game:Spawn?
`Game.Spawn` not `Game:Spawn`
```Game:Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LOCKED, ChestSubType.CHEST_CLOSED, pos, Vector(0,0), player)```
it wouldn't
what do you mean would, have you tried it ?
Would the following code work?
```Game:Spawn(ENTITY_PICKUP,EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_LOCKED, ChestSubType.CHEST_CLOSED, pos, Vector(0,0), player)```
(pos gets the player position)
yay
yes
since the update before the last update
return `true` or `nil` to have it deal damage
They documented the callbacks?
oh thx
^
to cancel damage
I think you can return false if the player shouldn't take the damage
return `false` from the callback
read the fine documentation
aka
<@!194259969359478784> rtfm
Depends if it's called before or after the damage
temporarily
or just set the player invincible
in MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG how do you cancel the damage?
doesnt really matter in the end, but still
isaac Spawn is easier since you dont need a seed or so
I just went for Game because I had the tab open ?
Both work
isn't it Isaac.Spawn
<:plum:259939492008296448>
I swear to god
Vazkii, add passive item charge generation.
Use Game:Spawn
How do I spawn a chest in LUA?
So tired, sorry
i need some grammar please
you what
bump, do somebody have a dummy main.lua file who do nothing for me to test ?
nvm found it
which class is the spawn function part of?
alright
i did not no
If not I'll report it
Did you send this to tyrone?
lucky me, i needed the effect from gamekid, and just used PowerPill isntead :p
?
had the problem earlier too
nop
Does anyone have any clue why UseActiveItem() is throwing a low level exception?
<@267415515138359297> playerinit also triggers when you continue a run after closing the application
<@229593818691928067> THanks

<@134478547795443712> Do you know anyone who can make a sprite of a stick of butter?

Hey ! I'm trying to follow this (complete noob in LUA) : https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhxv3/tutorial_how_to_add_and_use_custom_costumes/.
When it says :
``` Now, in your main.lua or wherever you are running this from. In a callback for something like MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, ```
Is there a dummy "main.lua" (?) to use to follow the purpose of the tutorial ?
moonscript fixes everything I don't like about lua and adds something I don't particularly like (whitespace dependency) but can deal with
using moonscript
man, the code is so much cleaner now
So I need a sprite for an item I just finished. Can anyone do a super simple sprite for me?
<@171044322781691904> yes that's the issue, show me entities2.xml
same
on the other hand, im not really familiar with lua
didnt seem logical to me either
i dont know, but that fixed the problem for me once
ok
dunno
like i said, declare the player inside the funcion
ayy that's me
there's book of genesis
Ok that was an issue but it still didn't fix my error of player being nil
okee
I  think the problem was that I didn't do ==true
<@109624258317033472>  it's declared outside functions
which means you can now use it with moonscript
has updated it with support for specifying custom completion scopes
the author of the sublime text ab+ package
<@134478547795443712> have you declared player twice or declared it above a function?
woo
(I'll try the link posted there before, too : https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhxv3/tutorial_how_to_add_and_use_custom_costumes/)
oh my god == true
<@229593818691928067> Is this my issue?
Also, I'm getting an error in the log:
```
[INFO] - [RiskReward] Error in PostUpdate call: ...es/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/riskreward/main.lua:21: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')
```
I tried to follow the default path, also modified my paths in the anm2 file to fit the modding system and it result in a bugged sprite/animation and no trace of my modifications. Kinda strange
https://hastebin.com/exomoberil.lua
My stats are not updating when I pick up my item. Can someone take a look at my code?
To test, i copied the green isaac mod, but it only load a modified sprite, no trace of anm2 there
2. isnt the sprite loaded in the anm?!
1. making a new character is difficult, but someone on the reddits has managed to do that, might wanna  search there
So, i have a modified sprite file based on the isaac default one, with some modification. To fit the sprite modifications, i also modified some animations. I have 2 file, the modifies .anm2 and the modified sprite one. I want to load them both.

For this i have 2 solutions :

- Making another character
- Overwriting isaac

Problems for now :

- I can load the modified sprite but not the modified .anm2, resulting in ugly animations.

My questions :

- How can i make another character ?
OR
- What are the paths to follow to making the game load the modified sprite AND the modified anm2 ?

(Sorry for the long message, tried to be clear !)
sorry
Game():GetRoom() it is
or anywhere else
nono
on the workshop
is there any mod that adds a familiar?
ohhh lowercase Game
game:GetRoom()
how do you get the current room?
let me delte extra images
waity

how can I test whether a new run has been started?
or
too big
Discord will host it !
<@229593818691928067> where do I host it
on pickup
how do I even make the item have a one-time effect
hmmmm
after picking up this item
<@171044322781691904> send me your whole mod directory in a zip or smth
I pick up a damage/firedelay modifying item
because it'll spawn it every single time
I can't spawn it in evaluate cache
actually dang
All I'm doing is a simple animation mod
I will try to be clear in my next message (i'll check your link after). Sorry had a big day and it's a bit late there.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhxv3/tutorial_how_to_add_and_use_custom_costumes/
this might help you
BlackSheep I don't really understand what you are asking to be honest
or should I spawn it in update/player effect update

is it ok to spawn things in evaluate cache
Or i have to redo the sprite to fit the default isaac sprite file ?
in that case idk
oh right I'd never examined it outside of the anm2 editor
anm2
the anm@
thats what I just posted
you need an animation named Idle in the .anm2

enumes are just ints, as far as lua is concerned
watch the health
https://youtu.be/3zWsK6i5ZjY
unheard of
in the ab+ api?
consistency
what am I even looking for
<@171044322781691904> if you can't get it to work send me your mod dir i'll take a look
The problem is that it's just a default isaac .png greenified, still basic. But, i do not find a way to load the modified .anm2
I do
¯\_(?)_/¯
called EntityType
because there's an enum
interesting
you need an animation named Idle
the type is the id yes
? ?
yeah
~oh is it?
something like
<@267415515138359297> the type IS the ID as far as i know
I'm thinking of writing something to simplify mod creation
it should be exactly the same process
yeah but just use the same method except with your bearded spirte
oh yeah I was going to go an overcomplicated route but actually, just download the green isaac mod and see how that does it :v
I did <@229593818691928067> it's the the default sprite greenified
maybe look at the Green Isaac mod ? <@81035468866584576>
by name
there's get entity type
<@229593818691928067> I checked the paths they are good
there isn't
Damn, i modified all the animations to fit the sprite >_<
Ok, there is a way to do that I think
sure there is
Default appearance ! <@154701703474577408>
is there no GetEntityIdByName?
do you want to change Isaac's default appearance, or make a beard grow on him when you pick up a certain item?
<@171044322781691904> maybe the animation FILE didn't get loaded
oh
Cakes in the oven! im back!
I'm not sure how you would do that then
that looks right <@171044322781691904> , i don't know ?
ooooh
(the character have a bigger head because beard)
The sprite are modified. How to load the animation file with the animations corrected, if that is possible ?
unless you want to add new animations, then idk
not the animation file
<@81035468866584576> no, you add a new character and just change the sprite paths lol
<@229593818691928067> this is my code
<@229593818691928067> like 10 times already
So, if i want to replace isaac animation/sprite, i'm a bit fucked ?
<@171044322781691904> i believe if you made the animation you need to restart the game, did you do that ?
has anyone figured out if it's possible to change the sprite of items in the "my stuff" page on the pause screen?
in the character selectino screen
you can do it, but it fucks up the gui
also adding new characters is a bit bugged
have code
does skinless hush
all characters
because it affects
wait
you aren't supposed to modify that file really
I spawned skinless hush and it crashed the game
Ok then, few things, how can i add a new character OR how can i make the mod thingy of afterbirth+ load my modified ``001.000_player.anm2`` file ?
<@229593818691928067>
it'll be a random item pedestal
if the item id is invalid
`spawn 5.100.ITEM_ID_HERE`
<@267112861921181697> 5.100.id
great
AKA transit
<@229593818691928067> Asterne is working on one apparently
how do I spawn a pedestal again
ofc it's okay to ask here
>questions about modding isaac
>is it ok to ask here
><#205854782542315520>
hopefully someone will make a linux animation editor
I'm trying to understand how to create mods for isaac, i tested a few things, sprited for a bit and i have some questions. Is it ok to ask here ?
hopefully it runs properly on wine
yeah that sucks :/
just to get it
and install ab+
in the animation files it's Idle
gotta run steam through wine
I hate that the animation editor doesn't have a native linux version
<@229593818691928067> both are idle
hi !
because yt embeds
upload the mp4 to youtube
Hello there !
or, if you're just trying to put it on discord
<@171044322781691904> is it idle or Idle ?
then convert to gif
record a video in mp4 for example
I had to go for a bit
ender I told you
how do I make a gif?
cool
you can add them, and start as them
but, still
alright
and fuck up the gui
in the menu they appear as blank
oh
yes
they show up on the menu ?
fuck I created an animation and called it idle why does it say this : [INFO] - [warn] no animation named idle
that will appear as blank
but you can add a character
seems a bit bugged
the character selection menu
yes
is that right ?
We can
well we can't add characters yet anyway
so it must affect it
I know that in characters the id denotes the position
no entities keep the id you give them
I wonder if that's the case with everything?
i noticed
it's dynamically assigned
the `id` field does nothing
ah, not sure if any of you noticed, but when you're adding items
i haven't played Antibirth but it looks amazing
anyone have anny challenge requests? i would like to stretch my legs
ah idk
having triggers
because I remember a lot of afterbirth enemies
I think they started using triggers late in rebirth dev?
especially when you've got Kilburn
although not even sure, not all enemies had consistent event triggers
Yeah it just feels weird because antibirth in general seems well made but those enemies just seem extremely amateur
yeah that was possible back then !
made by adding a lot of trigger events
the only benefit i have is i'm familiar with the xml files :p
remind me of amateur rebirth mod enemies
The wall spiders that shoot a wall of bullets in Antibirth
yes that's me
obviously
lol that's outdated now
I was translating the items names on items.xml and it was working just fine. Now i did a ton of progress and it's not applying the differences anymore
right?
i'll ask here
in the good old rebirth days
who invented custom entities
you're the guy
Oh nice
?
on reddit
yes
did Chronometrics say he would update it ?
Nice
that's awesome
to support ab+
basement renovator will be updated
the room editor is shit
lmao
InstaPreview in the room editor doesn't even work
since discord has yt embeds
or just record a video then upload it to youtube
record a normal video then convert it to a gif
How Do i record gifs?
returning `false` results in the enemy ignoring the damage
Hey guys, how would I spawn a chest using LUA?
returning `true` or `nil` results in the enemy being damaged
it's false
or it may be true?
iirc
from the entity damage callback
return `false`
yes
is there a way to deny damage taken?
by "just got an item" I mean the first time evaluate_cache is called after the item is added
add a method that checks if the player has just got an item
how do i record gifs?
IU got the sprite to work
why couldn't they just
ugh
i hate lua
I'm assuming that a torso replacement costume might just involve changing "type=none" in the xml, but I don't know what the other options are
and use SaveData
I'd have to detect new runs
however
for whether it already activated the effect
won't work when you reload the game
have a boolean
no it'd be more like
or actually
make a variable to store the original damage
actually
hmmm
How would I make it a one time change then
not a one time change
so it will be a multiplier
damage is still 0.5
and then I give myself the mark
its here bois
if I give myself my item
so
ok
when my buggy code kept dividing the damage
I've managed to get a custom costume for my item, now I just need to figure out how to get a costume to replace isaac's torso completely
I believe that I managed to get it to 0
it is?
there is a low cap of 0.5
should be able to, though
Probably a bit too harsh, but interesting none the less
you can't set damage to 0
interesting
hehe, I like that ?
Destroy good runs on curse of the blind
Could save shitty runs
Your thoughts, collect them.
that sets your damage to a constant value and it can never change
for an item
oh that gives me an idea
by setting it to 0
I shuold check
I guess
just when you pick it i think
help pls
```lua
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, function(self, player, flag)
  if player:HasCollectible(items.ghost) then
    if flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage * config.damage_scale
```
hmm
oh
or just a one time damage decrease
yes
will that be a multiplier
you need to put each stat under its corresponding flag
in mc_evaluate_cache
if I do `player.Damage = player.Damage * 0.5`
But when i add a second one they both stop working
i added a passive item that changes your stats
basically
I have a problem with that
so each item pickup
each time the cache is evaluated
or is it called just for that item
is MC_EVALUATE_CACHE called for each item every single time you pick up an item
and when I hold it up
yes
And when it's on a pedestal there's no sprite?
yues
<@267112861921181697> is it the same case in both the xml and on disk?
its png
so the result is a float
it's a .png, not a .pdn or a .jpg?
and firedelay_scale is not
that's because MaxFireDelay is an int
the error is in `player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay * config.firedelay_scale`
copied
Healthcare
I'm dumb
ooooooh
and just to verify, that is the correct filename for the image?
rip in peace
butt
https://hastebin.com/uzisocenul.xml
```https://hastebin.com/uzisocenul.xml```
pshh, and i thought RoboBaby did that ?
brb. gotta bake a cake
Ok, can you hastebin your items.xml?
show us the xml
that's where it is
C:\Users\User\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\Healthcare\resources\gfx\Items\collectibles
and is items.xml in the correct folder
<@267112861921181697> did you put the sprite in the correct folder in your mod folder, and did you specify that path in items.xml?
I'll give it a try.
Game():GetLevel()
or `gfx/items/collectibles`
did you put the sprite in `gfx/items`
Anyone know of a way to get the current floor yet?
for some reason my item does not have a sprite
You have to opt into giving mods the ability to `require`
It's for the better IMO
It is far.
I didn't realize how far apart iceland and sweden are
why? does it make your networking mod obsolete?
under luadebug
Require should still exist
sad about the require() removal
```lua
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE, function(self, player)
  if hack_set_fire_delay then
    player.MaxFireDelay = player.MaxFireDelay * config.firedelay_scale
    hack_set_fire_delay = false
  end
end)
```
good nap after it
relevant code
<@109624258317033472> flight was good
seems like an error in the bindings
aha, that looks like what I want
```lua
Error in PostPlayerEffectUpdate call: bad argument #2 to '?' (number has no integer representation)
```
any idea about this?

that i do not know <@154701703474577408>
ty
and you know, your mom is old proably because of aging. its a biological process.
doing that adds an existing costume to isaac, but how about a new custom costume?
just delete update.it
it gets marked old everytime an error appears
well... that too
"why is my mom suddenly old"
XD
not mom
mod*
help
<@267112861921181697> spawn 5.100.[id]
uhh why is my mom suddenly [OLD]
how do I spawn a pedestal with my item on it?
how was your flight? hope you had a great sleep ?
I have been summoned!

thanks!

I'm pretty sure its 32 but I need someone to clarify
\?
?
look it up
Whats the bitdepth for binding of isaac
steam workshop sucks tbh
congratz!
I even got the RNG working finally
Nice!
I think thats all for me for today See ya tommorow Guys
Source code here: https://github.com/atomoton/crackedD4
Mod finished!
but I'm done now
<@122924009527574530> made a post about it on the reddit i think
Alright I know I've been popping in here and asking questions, then leaving
do we know how to add costumes via xml, or custom costumes in general?
all I've found by way of examples are people setting the costume of an existing item onto isaac every single frame
they spawn on each other
because you can spawn them if you ahve redhearts
but when i try to spawn another one
no
are they constantly spawning or what? ^^
that shouldnt be too hard
Ok now i have to find a way so the familiars dont stack on each other
npnp, you fixed it :p
ty very much
? congratz
thanks for pointing that out
YES
i hope this time it works
love log.txt
i think whats happening now
well
Does anyone know about the EntityLaser.Endpoint ? what i want is the position where the laser hits the wall

yeah
oh hell
yourselves*
<@132627275307810817> is the log spitting any errors?
thank you all for not killing yourself bceaause of me
New idea for boss. Name: Edmund Mcmillen. This boss very fat and can make giant poops. This poops can make 100000000000000hp damage.
Im going to kill my self
My god
Been all day to try to do this item
1 eternal heart on boss room, 1 spirit heart on shops, and one heart of healing in treasure rooms
that's great
time to make the item sprite
hah, entities have specific gibs
YES! IT WORKS!
https://hastebin.com/ewesexibay.xml
whats your entities2.xml?
wich is useless rn
this is the only thing that is called familiar
They should fit pretty well in the game thematically
local customfamiliar =  Isaac.GetEntityTypeByName("testfamiliar")
http://i.imgur.com/zUo0kxk.png
I was thinking about drug items
Ive tried to comment out the Follow thing
Aftervape
damn. is your item tagged familiar? even though i dont think that matters
I have new great idea for mod. The vaping of isaac
xD
xD
Best thing we can do so far
666
Yes
and in the update callback, the last number as the variant of the familiar?
The way I modify tear damage and effects is giving the player that damage and effect right before creating the tear, haha
I have fixed the moving to the right thing
D>
Yes
have you the ID and variants correctly set?
I have a semi hacked together solution but it definitely isn't ideal.
Im still trying to find a way so my familiar follows Isaac ffs
Yeah. Hopefully we get it soon
after stats
It's basically the next thing
^
Yeah, we badly need to get the ability to edit tear entities
oh dear
Tears supposed to be punches, but eh tear entities
https://streamable.com/p4ano
<@132627275307810817>  what was the problem? ^^
and also if you declare a variable or function name with or without caps, it needs to be that way every other time you reference it
lua is weakly typed, but not *that* weakly typed
fixed the moving thing to the right, now the familiar doesnt move
or well, most languages are
Then you should read up on lua syntax in general
worth remembering
it needs to be exactly identical to what it says in the API
lua is case sensitive
Everything in programming is case-sensitive
I didn't realize that it needed to be capitalized, god
^
Seriously Ender, look at the error logs before posting
Isn't it GetPlayer?
That's self-explanatory
oh wait
hmm I cant find the problem here
[INFO] - [Healthcare] Error in PostUpdate call: ...es/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/healthcare/main.lua:9: attempt to call a nil value (field 'Getplayer')
hey that's good news :p
<@109624258317033472> still moving to the right, even commenting the FollowPosition
Ah
with more positive ratings it'll go higher
When I moved the line It just made another error
regardless of your ratings
workshop mods start out at 3 stars
thats weird
wat
3 stars?
24:1 positive:negative
then do i need the familiarupdate?

wait hold up
have you tried commenting that line out?
that should do it autmoatic
also. you dont need FollowPosition
D:?
what.
nope
have you set its velocity to -1,0 or sometinhg? ^^
xDDDDD
until it disappears
all the time
The familiar moves to the right
i think something is working wrong
scayze
coolcool
uhhhh, i saw that on edmunds twitter
That was a good mod thooo
the familiars one
a plumbus mod ? ?
book of genesis
whats the mod?
damn
feels bad
Damn, my mod has a 3-star rating on the workshop
also, if you want validroom and trigger to be global, delete "local"
why should that work?
<@267112861921181697> put the definition of the player in the update function
New update for http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=837254850
in entities2.xml?
the id
wait
let me try it
i have just changed it
<@132627275307810817> do you have ID set to 3, and variant to something unique?
``[INFO] - [Healthcare] Error in PostUpdate call: ...es/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/healthcare/main.lua:10: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')``
https://hastebin.com/tojunagiju.lua
robobaby seems in support of a full heart
xD
and then balance it
But first i want to finish my item
yeah
maybe a full heart is better
Well
<@267112861921181697> cant be that hard, whats the error? and could you upload the code to hastebin or sth?
and keep in mind that your item effectively doubles your damage
look at like razor blade
yeah
But they despawn after you exit the room
and you should make at a full heart at least
You can
cause if so that's really op
Yes
I don't know whats wrrrrrooonnnngggg
can you keep doing it over and over ghenza?
most of them are autogenerated, still tho
wut
uuuugggghghghghghghgh
Holy god damn shit. my lua file is 450 lines
like incubus
It will have the same dmg as Isaac
and spawns a familiar
It takes you half a heart of hp
never mind
oh ok.
Yes
yeah
that the item spawns?
oh is this a custom familiar that you're making
?
a passive item that adds a familiar
I would have to make a new item
so
makes both the temporary effect and the behavior much easier
of the familiar
give yourself the item temporarily
I definitely wouldn't spawn a familiar entity
ID HAS to be 3
not as ID, but as variant
Ok ghenza
yeah
its probably enough if its over 300 or so, doesnt reall matter
and put that number on entities2.xml right?
like 5289
should i put a high random number?
https://hastebin.com/ofomiwesac.lua
at the callback, the last number must be the variant of your familiar
yep
i think ive seen it on the workshop
<@134478547795443712> is it the book of something?
soz
https://hastebin.com/iparafijel.lua
screeeeeeeeeeeee
xDDDD
mb
yes
oh shit
do you even have any callbacks? xD
i think
17 lines
https://hastebin.com/tecafemaga.lua
haha robobabby very funny
RoboBaby is a genius xD
Shit i cant find this issue
personally, i dont mind if people post code snippets in here. it only is annoying when its more than 20-30 lines or sth
maybe that would help you?
I have an item that makes a temporary familiar
<@134478547795443712> yep
it sounds obvious but, somehow people don't always get it :v
is it only till the end of the room?
Yeah yeah dw
Or thats the idea
rather than straight into chat
Its an active item that takes half heart of hp and spawns a familiar that follows you and shoots tears
put it on hastebin or pastebin or something
its probably not  hundreds of lines so
why not
Do you want to see the whole code of the item?
Yep
wanna show us the code?
i think im using it wrong
but
im trying to use FAMILIAR_UPDATE
I'm not currently sure what is causing your error
I cannot find this issue, it says it cannot index nil value, and yet I provide the value 2 lines above it... ``local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function MyMod:PostUpdate()

    if player:HasCollectible( healthcare ) then``
do you use FAMILIAR_INIT and UPDATE?
Like
yes
that does it automtic?
ah
<@132627275307810817>, what exactly do you want to achieve?
so it follows Isaac
I dont know how to move my entity
Im really lost
it doesnt work xd
oh
``local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function MyMod:PostUpdate()

    if player:HasCollectible( healthcare ) then``
let me try something
xD wp
nvm
but there doesn't seem to be an issue?
Oh wait
oh wait it is giving me a line, line 10
main.lua:10 means line 10
if i want to change the position of a familiar
Its not giving me a line
``[INFO] - [Healthcare] Error in PostUpdate call: ...es/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/healthcare/main.lua:10: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')``
You guys would have a terrible time with Python.
<@154701703474577408> i know that struggle, my c++ syndrome kicks in
im stucked
attempt to index nil value
just a bit
can someone give me a hand with position and vectors?
end of line.... must semicolon
hm.. still not working... TO THE LOG!
it's muscle memoried for me
That's my best explanation. It's not even consistent. Some lines have it, some don't.
if it was me it'd probably just be muscle memory tbh
What's up with people randomly tossing semi-colons in non-single-line pieces of code? Is it doing something or are they just forgetting it's not required?
I want to try to program before I realize that it is impossible for me to do.
aight*
That's the issue eight
I'm afraid that's not a trait that will serve you well in programming, or getting help with programming :P
I have horrid memory
I keep forgetting ok
for the third time
delete update.it
i changed one letter and now its old smh
thanks
Nice, pipe
did i hear log.txt? http://www.github.com/pipe01/abp-log
Try to be self sufficient
It literally tells you the line your error is on
Syntrax

I was hoping that sufficient experience would encourage you to check log.txt to find out why it's not working *before* I had to tell you to do that, but maybe I'm being too optimistic
pls
Also, if you're looking for Afterbirth+ specific lua tutorials for beginners, check out <@83630921097437184>'s videos on how to create different mods.
its not working anymore
ugh
hastebin is pretty good
<@124248443383185408> +1
I didn't know about hastebin until today, convenient site
Anyone know how to get an "Entity" object?
if your mod does load but does something you don't want it to, it's time to check your logic
if your mod doesn't load or run at all, the place to check is log.txt in the Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ folder in My Games
belongs to "Entity"
most of us figured many things out by trial and error
There is a method called: GetDropRNG ()
what trustmelon said
I think I'm getting somewhere with RNG
Hi
Hey all
<@267112861921181697> look it up? That might work ?
Word of advice about modding. If you don't know what to do, ask a question. Don't sit here and constantly ask what you do next in order to make a mod. Everyone in this channel are attempting to make mods themselves, so do not attempt to get somebody to write code for you. If you need *extreme* help with lua, look up some videos online, don't come here asking people to do stuff for you, unless they are willing to and it's over pms.
does it show there the error :D?
time to get further acquainted with your old friend, log.txt
fuck
so
the second
then
how come itempools.xml doesn't wrok
it will usually add Update.it if:
1) if you don't have the api version set to 1 in RegisterMod
2) your mod doesn't load properly
oh shit
A fix for what?
it simply shows theres an error in your mod
<@126590786945941504> is there a fix for that?
Yeah I just rmembered
Delete update.it
The mod is still old for some reason
do not touch or i **will** scraem
my ideas are sacred
xD
You people all have such good ideas that I have to restrain myself from copying them, haha
I don't mind because I did volunteer but don't make a habit of it
he was helping me aight
so, stop
!item
<@267112861921181697> i don't know how jac feels about being pinged to write a mod for you
!item
this is my attempt to sort out that tree into less of a mess, there was probably a better way though
<@109624258317033472> can i ask you now my question?
https://hastebin.com/kahevuyivo.lua
i don't use linux
idk
is the Animation Editor not available on linux ?
What
ppl
<@154701703474577408> pls
Jac? Whats the fix?
any idea why this always does else?
if player:GetShootingJoystick().X == 0 and player:GetShootingJoystick().y == 0 then
      Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 6,0 ,Stand.Position,Vector(0,10),player)
    else
      Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR, 6,0 ,Stand.Position,Vector(player:GetShootingJoystick().X*10,player:GetShootingJoystick().Y*10),player)
    end
oh and this item took me 5 fucking hours
pls fix
oh there's still a logic error in my version, oops
great
now its old
¯\_(?)_/¯
blame beautify
There was AddHealth and AddHearts
<@66197463593136128> Space indents ?
I did
no idea, I assume you checked it in the api
https://hastebin.com/fihucuwomi.lua
that's better
AddHearts(2) works right?
¯\_(?)_/¯
i just ran it through my beautify plugin on atom
indent
here
https://hastebin.com/xusulopisu.lua
actually scratch that
4-char-display tab-indentation?
https://hastebin.com/ficehixiyo.lua
I mean
if you set the tab length correctly it's more efficient!
you take that back you heathen
*the master race*
tab-indentation
also you barely have any ends
*the future*
8-char indentation
I dunno
<@267112861921181697> what the fuck is that indentation
because you're not using elseif
aaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnd it doesn't work anymore
the less you duplicate lines the better, generally
instead of writing "room:IsFirstVisit()" three times you might be able to just separate that into its own check perhaps
also
for your stack of checks
use elseif instead of if
oh ok I get what you mean by shop and treasure
that is
Not that I tested
Not that I know of.
do you have a way to add items to pools?
hur?
https://hastebin.com/lupaduguke.lua
Wait endershot
basically copypste
Time to add the Shop and Treasure parts
Maybe.
I think it had just not reloaded your mod properly
just excited.
oops, sorry for caps.
IT WORKS
yes
close the log file and isaac and reopen it and see if it still says that
oh, endershot, did you restart the game since updating your mod
are you sure that is not an old bug report?
you may also need to rename the folder to Healthcare idk
Yeah
is your item named Healthcare in the items.xml
you cheeky cunt
robobabs
thanks for the support, robobaby
it seems like it is still complaining about the line "GetItemBy Name" as before
Yes, obviously.
<@267112861921181697> did you reload your mod since making changes
I can not figure out what is wrong...
Thanks, <@154701703474577408>.
which includes on continue
I think it is just "game began"
<@267112861921181697> -_- thanks
initilizing
someone worked it out yesterday but I don't remember exactly what they learned
init means beginning
Do we have an understanding of when all MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT is called?
getseed idk
Anyone know how to access the level seed?
I don't see whats wrong?
``local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Healthcare" );``
I'm so frustrated right now
Ah man wtf
thanks
yeah ok. dont really wanna do this with challenges, but if it works, it works
http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=837254850
the challenge blindfold is a setting, not an item
Glucoma?
add canShoot="false" to the challenge tags
the blindfold? no
it tells you what the problem is ender
well the error is in your line 2
which one can spawn?
is the eye-blind-thing from challenges an collectible item?
nothing

or is it that it works but just keeps giving you hearts?
time to go back to log.txt
great still wont work
ok well, you'll need to give it its own folder, create an xml file which contains certain details like the item's name and sprite (the details for trinkets I'm not certain of but they're probably similar to those for items), and then write a lua file that contains the actual behaviour
e.e
i only did the sprite
have you made an xml file? lua?
like, what it does and all
what step of creating it are you on
how do i set up my trinket functionality?
Ok I moved the room variable outside of the function
I'll need more detail than that, AllehValim :P
how do i make my trinket functional?
I just noticed haha
beause you are asking it to check the value of room, but you haven't declared room yet
in fact your code wouldn't work
you could even do uh
https://hastebin.com/tijihorunu.rb
Ehem
Better?
https://hastebin.com/codegajebo.lua
also you p[robably don't need to check what room you are in if you don't have the item
sorry lol I am dumb
well right now you are setting "trigger" but never checking its value :P
oh no shit
What do you mean?
yes apart from that currently trigger doesn't do anything, because you didn't tie it to your activation logic
would this work?
https://hastebin.com/vajonayogu.lua
forgot to change it
I did
in that case I think you need to write "not" instead of "!"
so, after naming the trinket 120, what do i do?
that way if i need to look back at the code I can understand it easier
I prefer to use Not
`room:GetType() ~= RoomType.ROOM_BOSS`
would work I think
brb
so maybe that would be similar
``!room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS``
I found a way to spawn a collectible on the ground when you pick up a passive item
``
can i easily make new projectile?
Not that we know of unfortunately
You should put that before `room`, not `RoomType`
ok
also
<@267112861921181697> Use `not`, not `!`
There's no clean way to do it, is there?
room:GetType() == !RoomType.ROOM_BOSS
Might do it tomorrow
I didn't add that in, was too lazy in the end
but shouldn't the item give you 5 bombs
\o/
<@126590786945941504> The brimstone effect works
so...
if it's a boss room, do what you already do
if it's not a boss room and your item has triggered, reset the trigger
well one easy way would be, as you are already checking what type of room you are in
I can easily enough figure everything else out
how would I check when i leave the room though?
so you make a variable to check that, set it to false to begin with, add it to your triggering conditional, set it to true once it gives you a heart, and set it to false again when isaac enters a new room
I figured that.
so spawn 5.350.120 would spawn your trinket
It is.
what you want to do is detect if the mod has already triggered
I believe the last trinket id in the game is 119
spawn 5.350.4 would spawn broken remote
help
send gelp
spawn 5.350.trinketid
That's an example, you can also do it with trinkets. Like g swallowed penny
that's a collectible
no
so if you want brimstone, you want to do g brimstone
not to spawn it on the ground
that's to give you it
https://hastebin.com/ateyacaqim.lua When I enter the boss room it gives me Eternal hearts constantly, I only want one eternal heart when I enter the room
yeah...?
`, then type g, and then the name of the item
Though they have t as a prefix
...?
Same way as spawning an item
So now, how do I spawn a trinket on the ground using the console?
And how to count the number of exits in a room
not really. you didn't give it a reason to exist.
It does exist tho
Does anyone know how to make it so you can open all doors like Dad's Key? I'm trying to do it with this item: https://hastebin.com/xapixixaju.lua
you cant use a variable that doesn't exist
attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'StandSprite') ?QUE?
https://hastebin.com/ateyacaqim.lua
I'll try it out
I put it on the workshop http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837193742
too busy
it looked cool but I haven't tried it
nop
Did anybody perhaps test brimbomb?
kk
Off topic pls go back on topic
So, uh
SOon
xD
soon
robobutt
ROBOBEBEH
ROBO BEBE
oh
we want you to embed your code in a site rather than paste it into chat, not to leave
oh
eh key
it worked
butt
nice
Button
...no, robobaby
It's the button under escape in most cases
<@221628025463111680> press ` or the button to the right of L on Spanish keyboards
<@221628025463111680> Enable mods and press ` in-game
that's not it
You want me to leave, so you don't have to deal with my amalgamation of code, then Ill leave.
How do I enable the console?
I put the code in Hastebin
? Sounds good to me, Kube. I'm making them to add a friendly voice to the process for those intimidated by the vastly more efficient text-based knowledge.
ok
hastebin retains formatting
https://hastebin.com/xapixixaju.lua
It's much lighter
Use hastebin
Don't use pastebin, please
its mostly endershot posting his shitcode every letter change
ctrl+shift+V, enter, ctr+v
pastebin.com, paste. done
Use ShareX
no it does not
that takes a lot more time, too though.
^
It fills up the chat *really quickly*
What's that indentation?
Can everyone please start using hastebin if you're posting lua samples that are longer than a line or two
argh
But I've stopped watching youtube guides around the time I stopped making them with notepad and fraps
```function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        if player:HasCollectible( healthcare ) then
            local room = Game():GetRoom();
                  if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS  and room:IsFirstVisit() then --this is giving me eternal hearts CONSTANTLY, not just one.--
                    player:AddEternalHearts(1);
                else
                    return
                end
            end
end```
And I haven't watched it, so I'm not saying you've got them
No, I'm talking about Lua misconceptions
I am so sorry for annoying you all
I made this item that opens doors, but not boss doors or doors in the Chest/Dark Room. Is there any way I can alter my code to do this? Here's my code:
```function mod:use_item16()
    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
    room = Game():GetRoom();
    gridSize = room:GetGridSize();
    for i = 0, gridSize-1 do        
            grid_ent = room:GetGridEntity(i);
            
            if(grid_ent ~= null) then
                variant = grid_ent.GetVariant(grid_ent);
                is_door = grid_ent:ToDoor();
                
                if (is_door) then
                    room:DestroyGrid(i, true);
                    Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_DOOR, 0, grid_ent.Position, true);
            end
        end
    end
end```
Probably a really dense question, but does anyone here know what ` GetGridCollision()` is meant to return
<@126590786945941504> My second video definitely does have one of those, because it was before the callback documentation update. Sorry about that.
And not give otherwise
Sorry lol
To check if you already gave yourself an eternal heart
You'd edit the code
*sigh*
how would I edit the code to make it only give me one eternal heart
Most of the guides are filled with misconceptions
The problem isn't about them being slow
it kept giving me eternal hearts constantly
tbh
Me rn
o h n o
gotcha!
ah so for people like endershot
My videos are very slow and aimed at non-programmers. If you are experienced, they will seem to take an eternity.
Ah I didn't see the third video had come out
will be dumb ones based on spelling, capitalisation, or syntax
a lot of the errors you will encounter
ummmmmmmmmm
>Passive Item Start to Finish
>51:45
that was one dumb error
ooo Lua
Otherwise I'd probably go into rants about how stupid it is
I'm not going to watch it
What a function is
It goes into detail on the absolute basics of lua
For efficiency, unambiguity, clarity and good coding practices
But should have
Just have him watch this
Well, not need
ofc he does need those variables at the top of the code
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZJyHSWa_My5DDoTQcKCgs475xIpQHSF
erm
you also probably don't need those to be variables at the top of your code yeah but, he's new to programming so let's start by making it work before fixing best practice :v
<@124248443383185408> Whether you want to do multiple assignments at once or global variables, it's gonna be either ugly or bad practice
Just indent the healthcare and game lines within a function
arghg
learn to love log.txt, it will usually tell you what line of your code is the one that is breaking hte mod
You don't need to have local on every line
change `local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Healthcare" );`
to `local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Healthcare" );`
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Healthcare" );
local game = Game()```
Editted message
alright so what that tells you is what part of your mod is not working properly
I meanh
<@267112861921181697> It's `Isaac.GetItemIdByName`
does the d infinity just change randomly after using it?
:c
o rip

found some
talking to endershot not you :p
Wait what
what>
it'll probably be near the bottom if that was the last thing you did
because i didnt upload it yet
there are none
look for ones with your mod name mentioned
actually I think that's uh, that one is on nicalis not you
about a thousand...
A lot more than 300 lines
Oh my
It takes up about 300 lines...
i found that
[INFO] - [warn] no animation named Head
or what
do i leave that blank
theres a spot for the steam item ID
Would it be SpawnEntity func?
in the metadata
like
WHat do you mean
Uhh
idk about that one then, probably need to use the room editor
or maybe it's doable in lua but it's not something i have tried
<@!134108150155444224> what if the id for the mod already exists
Spawn on ground
Is there a certain line I am looking for? Most of this seems useless,
what about the ID
do you want to spawn it on the ground or just give it to yourself?
mod uploader
go to the tools
to workshop
how do i upload mods
How do you spawn a trinket in the starting room?
if you were just playing then it'll be a big file
Its taking a while to openh...
Its fine, I understood.
robobaby why are you stalking me D:
I said the wrong name
also the correct folder is my games/binding of isaac afterbirth+, not rebirth
Ah, thank you. I did not see that, as suspected. Thank you!
http://i.imgur.com/rp5kbSs.png
scroll up and next time you ask for advice, read the replies :v
It's probably not the *only* problem.
if this is about deleting line 4, I have already done that and it did not work.
he used caps literally one time
scroll up
I may have missed your message in which you told me what I needed to fix, so if you could, do you mind re writing it?
because his "comedic hyperbole" is essentially spam and it makes everyone far less likely to help him while also being very noisy
i don't undertsand why you're so hostile to him
Anyway.
he was just joking
comedic hyperbole
I overreacted at that point, yes, but I realized my idiocy and will try harder to not press a button that makes letters look more menacing
it's what they call
I have told you what to do and you haven't done it yet so I can't really help you any further until you stop writing defensive messages and go do it
Your tips have been helpful though
before we got sidetracked by something else
he was typing in all caps literally the last time he talked about his mod
I just want to figure out whats wrong so I can learn from it and make a mod.
he's acting pretty normal tbh
Why are reacting to something that happened about twenty minutes ago?
he's not typing in all caps lol
this is like, the basics of programming, this will happen a lot
if this is your reaction every time you are overreacting
I am not all caps anymore...
endershot you are typing in allcaps and freaking out whenever you make a minor mistake
are there any lines in it with your mod's name in them
I am not overreacting?
open log.txt
go to my games > the binding of isaac rebirth
<@267112861921181697> just stop. We're trying to help you out but you are making it very difficult and you're overreacting when it doesn't work
anyway my item still isn't working, and I cannot figure out why.
uh huh huh hum
so you were only pretending
I didn't even say the word butt
you gotta chill
<@!173420370773147649> i r o n y
no problem xD
the fact that you got offended is more proof that youre 13
I r o n y
why did robobaby tag my message with E
irony bruh
<@267112861921181697> stop being annoying on purpose then
he was following my lead
i did the xdd face
lmao
kyozm is the mastermind behind green isaac
It was sarcasm you dick
no offense lmao
omg
xD
yea
oh wait did you make green isaac
endershot are you like, 13
I'm not intending this as an insult it would just help me to understand what has been happening :v
>green isaac
how did they do that
wait people change the charges for items
but yeah my item still isn't working
f r u s t r a t i o n
xxxxxxxxxxxDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
isaac is now green xdd
creating new items
lots of things, but not that :P
What the fuck is possible then
probably not possible
idk how you'd do that
"fix the pills" is something people wanted since mods were even teased yeah
so
I think that might be a hardcoded thing with phd
basically gonna make a Better PHD mod
ahhh
nope
oh
To edit what the game considers "good"
<@267112861921181697> did the code work?
No
idk
to add a new pill?
oh wait
there is
why is there no pill pool
idk if it's even possible
my mod is so simple but like
huh
oh really
just a guess
they do have a tag for removals
you'd think that but, that's also how to make pretty much any passive item with a consistent effect
they just don't want to release any source material
well endershot that's probably not their reason
sounds like lag tbh
that's true actually
lol
and then adding your own code in
They don't want to implement a mod that deletes items.
lol
by running a check every update for if you have that item
you could rewrite the whole thing using the same name and id
you *can* edit existing items
actually technically
a bit of an oversight
that seems like
<@!134108150155444224> nope
if you're not going to use it then delete the whole line, not half of it
i don't wanna beat a dead horse, but is there no way to edit existing passives?
oh
and then not telling it what that variable is
you are telling it that you want a variable
no
but you just arnt using a variable?
which stops it from working
it throws an error
half of programming is spending 30 minutes realising that you forgot to capitalise something
because
how would that effect if the code worked or not?
if you go allcaps every time you make a syntax error this is going to be a very tiresome time for everyone

what's up?
guys please help
ok
try it out
when it updates the flag
no
doesn't that still only do the flag when you pick up the item
if you specify the flag it wont update when other flags do
function snappyExpansion:cache(p, flag)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  
  if player:HasTrinket(player, snappysTail_trinket) and flag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
    player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed - 0.1
    Isaac.DebugString("I HAPPEN")
  end
ooh
every time it updates
yeah but that just infinitely increases stuff
oke ^^
that thing

<@109624258317033472> ill i ask you later
if player.Luck < 5 then
kyo have you found out how to do stat changes as long as another stat is within a certain range?
i just spent 30 mins looking at it like "the fuck is wrong" xD
lol
i kno xD
it's not a collectible
kyo is it because
eyy
heyyyy
Soo, im back home! hoorey
a realtime log viewer i made https://github.com/pipe01/abp-log

How do I do FamiliarVariant for a custom/modded familiar
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2758/brimstone-bombs
Cant you add item pools with the item pool editor
Has anyone figured out the RNG?
Here's my daily check yet though
as in it's done enough until they update the API
*finished
I just finished my item I'd love to have it in pools lol
man that sucks
Still Borkd
can we do item pools yet?
daily check
With a setColor?
i need that for a copy
giveitem pentagram
And you interpolate the alpha of the entity color based on that
But you basically keep a counter based on how many ticks passed
there is set color
The whole thing's a little bit complicated
<@126590786945941504> How do i do this, i mean by function in lua not by making sprite animation tho
it doesn't give me the eternal heart
its still not working
help
<@220525353830055936> I think you can just color it with alpha
xD
i just noticed that
to passive
nope lol
?
did you change <trinket ...> at items.xml
THE ITEM IS STILL A TRINKET
HELP
HEY
Is there any function to fade in/fade out entity?
Okee
Hey I am gonna be a bit on and off, for a bit, I need to clean my room.
im pretty lost with vectors, positions and updates xD
I'm on my way home atm, can help you better in a few minutes
then im doing something wrong xD
hmm
Similar to npc update update
Just as update but also give the fam id  as addcallback param
i dont know if that thing updates every frame but you get what i mean
well
Does it update every frame like MC_POST_UPDATE but only for familiars?
Hmm. I have some questions to ask but i dont want to waste your time xD so just one question: how does exactly MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE work?
Told you :D
never wanted to die so much
AddCollectible()     Lets say. Leo effect
Nommin
xD
lol
Heathcare
yep
xD´
Look at get item by name
i think i will anyawy
You're gonna facrpalm
kek
o
Found the mistake
?
God
My
Oh
well what is getdecorationseed ?
its still a trinket also
Haven't tried decoration seed tho.
makes sense
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );
local game = Game()
local lastRoomValue

    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
        if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
            lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()

        end
    end

``` pleas halp
If called from the room, obviously
Nono getseed is different for every room
i think
^
?
getseed for the whole run
getdecorationseed is for each room
it was like that
idk
Why do you use getDecorationseed and not getseed?

Im getting different things mixed
And it's a public member, not a function
Yep sorry
Position capital p
hmm
so
oh
it's a Vector not a function
it's just player.Position
i thought someone told me it was .position
<@229593818691928067> whats the function for getting isaac pos?
i just got an item, did nothing in particular
s a m e
I always wanted a bucket of lard
hm
nnnOOOWWW
I want brimstone
Cool
`Isaacpos = player.Position ()`
-> `player.Position` it's not a function
function mod:familiarUpdate ()
    Isaacpos = player.Position ()
    customfamiliar:FollowPosition (Isaacpos)
end
You have found **2** item(s).

Can anyone help me with the familiar position thing just for a second_
get player has a mistake
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );
local game = Game()
local lastRoomValue

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0}
        if not player:HasCollectible( healthcare ) then
            return
        end
    
    
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
        if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
            lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
            player:AddEternalHearts(1);
        end
    end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
Without any `=`
And in that case you can just do `local lastRoomValue`
`nul` only works because the global `nul` is `nil` in this case
ill fix it
Also, it's `nil` not `nul`
Oh, gods of fucked up indentation, please help me
if player:HasCollectibe(item) i believe
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );
local game = Game()
local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0}
    if not player:HasCollectible then
        return
    end
    
    
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
And use `player:HasCollectible`
Move the `local player =` to the beginning of the function
<@126426442555719680> it's ` not ,
use those on start and finish
Another thing
better now?
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );
local game = Game()
local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasCollectible( healthcare ) then
        return
    end
    
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0}
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
jesus
Hmm
I have Isaac. get room whatever
after function before isaac
which one?
Before the `Isaac`
where do I put the local player =
wait no that was the point nvm
fail haha
^
\`\`\`lua
code
    here
\`\`\`
if all mods do their logic in MC_POST_UPDATE it's going to be a performance issue eventually :/
shit
Also you missed `local player =`
type ```, paste, ````
But there is `Isaac.GetRoom()`
how do I use the code font in discord
better?
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );
local game = Game()
local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasCollectible( healthcare ) then
        return
    end
    
    Isaac.GetPlayer(0}
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
Calling a C function and creating an object that you pass back from the C function to Lua can't be good for performance
And in this case just use `Isaac.GetPlayer(0)`
Do `local game = Game()` outside of the callback if you need the `Game` object
`Game():GetPlayer(0)`
But I think you're doing one very, very stupid thing performance-wise
hm?
I'm not 100% sure
One thing
Is that better?
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Healthcare", 1 );
local healthcare = Isaac.GetItemByName( "Heathcare" );

local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasCollectible( healthcare ) then
        return
    end
    
    local player = Game():GetPlayer(0);
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
Good sarcasm :P
item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName
you must also define the item
i like your code <@126590786945941504> it's instructive ?
GetCollectableByName?
but yeah instead of HasTrinket you check if player:HasCollectible(item)
i just wanted to get your code again but i can see it now
And obviously change the `GetTrinketIdByName`
o h
i dmed you lol
I asked physilver but I thought he died
use `HasCollectible` instead of `HasTrinket`
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Ticket", 1 );
local Trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName( "Ticket" );

local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasTrinket(Trinket) then
        return
    end
    
    local player = Game():GetPlayer(0);
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end

yo kuberoot
I'm pretty sure my entire family is addicted to kickstarters

Just to see how people do things
I could use it to create my own bombs
I am
sure
Well
just that one step

nothing after that
After all these years I still remember how to get one side of the rubix cube done
xD
Perfect timing

thanks
`ply.Position`
To get the position of Isaac, do I need to use .Position, .GetFreeNearPosition or what?
oh ok
I'm spawning effects in 4 lines on an update checking if everything's in the room, destroying grid objects and damaging enemies
kms
i am a dum
In the other version
I'm spawning one effect
In this version you're seeing
am I a dum
How do I explain this
what
dude
erm
much better than before
woag
Sure let me get go my pc
On request: https://streamable.com/r8cy2
could you elaborate
well
Lots of things lol
just putting 1 probably works but mine stopped doing it entirely when I entered 1.0 so who knows
what would I need to change to make this a passive ```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Ticket", 1 );
local Trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName( "Ticket" );

local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasTrinket(Trinket) then
        return
    end
    
    local player = Game():GetPlayer(0);
    local room = Game():GetRoom();

        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
1.0
<@154701703474577408> whats the api version now?
asking again:
no lol
I thought it gave you a container
update.it appears if your mod has a bug in it, or if you don't set the right api version number at the top
lol
not gives a container
Oh ok
It fills a container
or a red container?
A red heart
<@267112861921181697> thats too broken imo
And sounds cool
That sounds more for an item
I think
does DebugLog() write to the log.txt?
it gives you an eternal heart upon entering a boss room, a spirit heart for entering a boss trap room, and a red heart for shop and item rooms
wut
is that right ?
while [ 1 ]; do rm update.it 2>/dev/null; done
how about this
wait
because it shows my mod as old
I just delete it everytime
<@126426442555719680> that happens to me aswell
You dont
caffeine shakes
sorry
oyu odnt
how can I stop update.it from appearing?
^
and soul hearts too I guess
I know how to add eternal hearts now
I mean
recoding existing things is the best way to learn apparently
I looked at that mod yesterday
I mean
I dont have any problem with that
dw
I did what they told me
yeah
thats hairpin edited right?
Oh
into a passive?
```local MyMod = RegisterMod( "Ticket", 1 );
local Trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName( "Ticket" );

local lastRoomValue = nul;

function MyMod:PostUpdate()
    if not Game():GetPlayer(0):HasTrinket(Trinket) then
        return
    end
    
    local player = Game():GetPlayer(0);
    local room = Game():GetRoom();
  
    if room:GetType() == RoomType.ROOM_BOSS and lastRoomValue ~= room:GetDecorationSeed() and room:IsFirstVisit() then
        lastRoomValue = room:GetDecorationSeed()
        player:AddEternalHearts(1);
    end
end


MyMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, MyMod.PostUpdate );

```
Ah perfect thank you ?
how can I change this:
can also be accessed in their Entitiy properties i think
<@267357666282700801> entities in the xml have a shutdoors attribute
it's easier to just do a boss without taking damage than to do a whole floor without taking damage
it's not a bad idea, just like I said, as a stronger version of a trinket I would probably just make it an item rather than a trinket
Anyone had trouble with spawned entities preventing doors from opening upon clearing a room?
i think it's a cool idea though
I honestly never knew what Maggies faith did
Also I am dumb and didn't know that it was like Maggies faith, I am so sorry
EntityPlayer::HasFullHeartsAndSoulHearts    (        )    ?
does the boss rush count as a boss room?
yeah
that's a neat synergy
:o
so if you live until the boss room without getting hit you get a heart container :v
you could have maggy's faith *and* this item
hey actually if you had the smelter
hm...
how would I check that, though?
<@267112861921181697>  maybe it would be more balanced if it only gave an eternal heart IF you don't have an soul/black hearts ?
I am not creative
pls jerbear
endershot is on a "similar item" roll right now
Lost sprite is just placeholder, i need to make if align, appear only when chargin and attack
Like infamy
doesn't sound like a bad item tbh but as a very similar trinket already exists I'd maybe make it an item instead
may be it go in front of you and block projectiles
ah so it's like a better version of maggy's faith?
right xD
With barrage of punches
lol
It will punch
So if you beat the boss without getting hit you get a free health
<@220525353830055936> what will the ghost do ?:)
that's interesting Ender
it gives me an eternal heart on entering the boss room
my trinket works
yey

Don't think so, I'm playing without sound, didn't even think to check
doest it make the rumbling sound ?
it looks perfect <@126590786945941504>
I just realised sideview rooms are weird http://i.imgur.com/gBx2YDS.png
Idk why my music mod is not working, in my folder is all ok but plays the normal boss song, I passed the files into one music workshop mod and its OK :/
whats the default id for a new trinket
is implementing AB- items in AB+ a thing ?
https://streamable.com/8oqj7
Yes, they do damage
oh right those are the stones bombs! neat !
oh ok
Do they damage you btw?
oh neat
If you write it will autoshow all possible combinations
from antibirth
give c{id} for colletibles give t{id} for trinkets
stone bombs
Thats really cool
I might've done it

guys
via console
ender will you fucking read the docs
sure
how do I give myself a trinket
more or less at least?
right?
I have to do a new function wiht the mc_update thing that checks isaac pos and then it changes familliar pos
or methods on entities, i don't know maybe some helpers
lUbA
luba
Luba
so
Hmm
When i move my familiar is all shakey why?
Luab
if you don't want to do all that though you can look for a pathfinder
that makes sense
ok
Oh
<@132627275307810817> you can update the familiar's position and velocity and access the player's so the idea is you can implement whatever movement pattern from that
problubamatic
Press B by mistake -> Create a meme
I dont really know where to start
I wish I knew
Is that with the offset?
T_T
for Luba
how can i make so the familiar follows isaac?
what is
its a meme now
oh no
a little
hey ender have you played antibirth yet
aaah
lube
luba is my favoirte language
luba
luba
*Luba*
wait does "require" not work anymore
*Lua
PSA: Order in wich you declare functions is important in Luba
just try it
oh no

not surprising he'd pull this after that whole dog thing

zatherz*
lets kill zathers
If only he tripped down a flight of stairs after sending that email ?
jesus
What a bitch
they should have at least let people use it, just not upload it to the workshop

Lua viruses have been a thing for ages, it's no excuse to just fucking shut down most of your game's modding potential
But people is just retarded af
that was a good thing for some mods
i mean
hmm
oh
last I heard only half the stat functions they added work lol
lua socket let people execute some forms of outside code, essentially, ghenza
some people were using it to create a multiplayer mod, others could potentially have used it for malware
but nah it's probably just sandbox forever
here's some free stat upgrades, maybe they'll work
obviously there are far better solutions
enjoy your shitty sandbox
true
Of course not
i hope this is temporary and they'll change their mind on that shit
if the wrong person had been involved before now there could have been a huge disaster
as a total mistake
but nope they just whoopsied and let people potentially upload big ol viruses
New in this
maybe they'll just keep people from uploading unsafe mods to the steam workshop
?*
Whats the prob with luasocket_
unlovable shithead: two butt lickers follow you everywhere and deal contact damage to enemies
I thought okay, they're just letting people do whatever I guess
honestly it did not even occur to me that nicalis was so fucking stupid that they didn't even realize what luasocket could be used for
Unloveable Shithead?
you could make that a mod
I hope that unloveable shithead feels good about himself
and thas it
he has 2 buttlickers that follow him everywhere
theres that
everyone hates him
Even from the subreddit?
he has
How has he not been ostracized from the community
doesn't get much cuntier than that
yup
What a fucking CUNT
LOL
tweeted it, posted it on both subs i think
at ed and tyrone
zatherz quote
he actually tweeted that
that's what he said
nope
I hope that's a joke pajeet
wow
"Huge security holes in AB+ api. Email me or releasing in 48 hours"
Cunt
he used the security problems as practically blackmail to make tyrone talk to him and listen to his stupid suggestions
Wait what did zatherz do
anyone could have pointed out the potential security issues, they were super obvious, but zatherz was just the first cunt to exploit it
well, there were secuity issues. you could inject clandestine DLL's in the game
malware could easily be slipped in there
And doesn't magically go through walls
Now it destroys rrocks
if you look at the mods on the workshop, there's a ton of popular shitmods
http://i.imgur.com/grsFbwh.png
yay
zatherz
well
And they removed in a patch because of "security issues" lmao
That was like, the one promising thing about the API
pretty sad cause that couldve been cool
proves that tyrone is one of the biggest fucking morons running a game studio
And it already would've taken a significant amount
yeah i think so?
At least, not without far more effort
So without it, that's out the window
in the year they allegedly worked on it
I can't speak from experience but luasocket was what would've enabled a potential online multiplayer mod, IIRC
and it was instead something that they somehow fucking did not manage to consider
the fact that this was not a deliberate decision to allow modders freedom and the risks that come with it
?
"Some changes were made to Lua sandboxing"
Yeah in very vague terms
on steam
they released with patch notes explaining the change
i THINK they removed that due to potential exploits? idfk, hella lame nonetheless
I wish transit were here so I could bug the shit out of them, I believe they touched on this exact topic ?
my mod just randomly dissapeared
oh great
Could someone explain the API limitations introduced in the Jan 7th patch?  Just read this:

"They removed require. That just killed my SuscriberBabies mod... bc i need LuaSocket"
look at things other people have written, look at the docs *before* asking
Player: HasFullHearts ()
if you just opened the docs you'd see right at the top
I thought i asked too many questions
you're free to ask questions of course but we can't write your mod for you dude
do some experimenting
read that tools/LuaDocs/class_entity_player.html
Health is just a stat
lol
sorry
cap lock
<@267112861921181697> you're getting on my nerves
relax mate
I DONT HAVE THAT CODE
copy code from <3
<@267112861921181697>
o
I am not that interested in room editing
is there a thing like this for full HP player:FullCharge();
I'd have to assume that you can or it's not a terribly useful tool, but I guess that's not a safe assumption
?
via room editor
yes but not via lua
can you add rooms
code wise
wait
are trap rooms and boss trap rooms different

Download mods and reference them, sift through the HTML doc for things relevant to what you want to do, ask questions here and someone *might* answer you
its flooded
can't you scroll up the chat???
what are those two numbers_
vector velocity
can you send the familiar template
jean
jean
1. Look at other mods's code
2. Read the docs
3. Ask questions here
Hmm
until this morn
I basically copy pasted the rubix cube code and nobody told me an item exactly like it already exsited
I just told you, read the HTML doc
I don't know where the fuck to start
If you say you can't, you only set yourself up for disappointment later on
You have to try anyways
If you say you're too dumb to do X, what makes you think you're not also too dumb to do Y and Z
can you remove curses from floors? i'm trying to use Level:RemoveCurse and it doesn't seem to have an effect
I am too dumb to program that
the familiar that makes holy light doesn't exist right ? do that :p
could have made the superior "infinite bombs" version even
pyromaniac and host hat make you immune to explosions but pyro is an item we could have made before they updated the api
I cant even think of an original idea for fucks sake...
all pyro/boom! do is give you bombs
I am retarded
^
pyro*maniac* heals you
<@267112861921181697> There are multiple items in AB and AB+ that do that already, are you sure
but pretty much anything you'll want to do will be complicated with this api, except a custom challenge
pyro is x99 bombs
wtf are you on
no
pyro makes you heal from explosions
that idk
i think pyro should do something
oh ok
the holy like tears
not the laser
<@267112861921181697> maybe the holy light is a variant of brimstone
Wait can I just make an active item that spawns a rock explosion? that's really easy
oh
making new transformations weirdly would probably be easier :p
I didn't, I'm using ROCK_EXPLOSION
I need to do something easier
@KubeRoot how did you set the angle for shockwave
do we know how to add items to existing transformations? 
I imagine that might either be xml or impossible, don't think I saw it in lua
?
And that's what you're gonna have to deal with
but the documentation is fucking terrible
WIP
eeeyo http://i.imgur.com/Kdb9Tih.png
People are having to do that even now, there are no indepth tutorials yet so that's your best bet for figuring out how to do specific stuff
Look through the HTML doc and find the things relevant to your mod
follow player
I'll need this eventually, useful stuff
I just want it to follow Isaac and shoot holy tears
I just want it to follow Isaac and shoot holy tears
idk how to shoot a holy shot
idk how to shoot a holy shot
take it one step at the time
you can make it follow isaac, make it orbit, make it move around the room etc. with fam.Velocity, fam.Position etc.
So how do I make it so every so often it shoots a holy shot
that's your job lol
oh ok
i have to code that now
well mine doesnt do anything
`fam.Position = player.Position` is the only line of code
hey man it's pretty self explanatory did you look at the code ?
follow Isaac?
sure
What does it do?
i love you
THANKS JEAN
IT WORKS NOW
YES
go there
well
it's new apparently
It wasn't there before... or I am more retarded than I thought
lol
there's <#267353315073982465>
and how would i?
We need a spriting channel for this shit
A light in the glass
that's probably what I'd do
id do something like this
and not the water
yes
just shade the glass

?
Maybe light dots on the glass
How do I change stats?
not the water

Hey aleeh
all the shading and shit is off
now what
ok
Does it follow the player or does It just spawn in the miuddle of the room
it crashes

but
thats what im doing
hmm
welp that really doesn't help what I want too much
o
no it just exists
or does it just exist
to get the familiar in game type `spawn 5.100.511`
oribital?
Jean what kind of familiar is this?
They should have done a lot of things
onFamUpdate
that's too sensible for nicalis
having a point of refrence would be helpful
they **should** have made at least half of ab+ items using their own api as examples and for testing but
I know
again this is not clean or anything but it WORKS and if you understand how you should be good
yep
so there's no lua version to see
I know
yep
so there's no lua version to see
Thank you jean
the items in game weren't made with Lua
<@126426442555719680> Most of the "actual items" weren't scripted in lua
Thank you jean
Thank you so much Jean
that was easy
this would all be so much easier if we could see actual items in the game in lua
xD
Hey, there you go!
Custom Familiar Template
theres a lot of items like that
<@132627275307810817> Reference workshop mods which have familiars in them
with familiar shit
but it is a shitty example
I feel like shit considering an item I made already kind of exists
alright this is far from optimal but it should give you an idea
Custom Familiar Template
neeed help pls
but it is a shitty example
I feel like shit considering an item I made already kind of exists
Custom Familiar Template
neeed help pls
I feel like shit considering an item I made already kind of exists
And in that case, the accenting is inconsistent
but it is a shitty example
And in that case, the accenting is inconsistent
but it is a shitty example
only a bit
milk wasnt transparent
Really it's less shading and more "accenting" the corners
i think it kinda doesn't shade
then you'll be in style :p
can i upload a file over here
A glass of water is transparent, does it "shade" from lack of light at all
and make it look sort of like that
That's probably the easiest thing to do
holy water
honestly just look at the uh
The thing is though
Do you guys have any idea of how to create a custom texture pack?
(but also consider that water doesn't generally cast much of a shadow)
ok
no shading symmetry
shading*
that's the important consideration, absolutely not symmetry
my mind is still fucked
oh ok
<@154701703474577408>, Upper left
Why is there an extra pixel of shading on the right side that the left doesn't have if the light is coming from the upper left?
top right(
I can't offhand remember what the usual light direction in Isaac is but you should check
but look at swallowed penny for example, the light doesn't come from the top left
Sorry I flipped it by accident
Why is there more shading on the bottom right than the bottom left if the light is coming from the upper left? That doesn't follow the rule at all
shade based on a light source
It makes it look wrong
but the ocd
<@267112861921181697> It's inconsistent though
yes
Symmetrical shading looks ugly as fuck honeslty
has anyone tried ShowHallucination in Game()? it just crashes when I attempt to use it
but if you make all the shading symmetrical you are just pillow shading
symmetrical antialiasing you should definitely have
light normally comes from the top left
be careful of symmetrical shading
Your looking from above
nothing
what does the angle of the cup have to do with anything
dammit
symmetrical shading
Flotilia the angle of the cup makes it so it cant be symetrical
hmm, interesting question. Do we know how to add items to transformations yet?
it's a cyllinder
I forgot
Fuck
that just edits staes
Fix this or my OCD will hate you forever
<@221628025463111680> The lineart is symmetrical but the shading isn't
How hard would it be to create a new Syringe
^
you could put some white reflective glass streaks on there or something maybe
maybe make the center brighter
it looks undetailed
but other than that it's fine
I spelled that wrong shit
I think the border in the bottom corners is missing a couple pixels
Just want to appoligize for being salty, I didn't have my kickstart
yeah seems alright
does ab ccl work with ab+
better?
final version

if you figure it out tell me
I'm working on babylike shooting familiar
I wish this was like Terraria where you could reference an AI and edit the stats from that
How would I do that?
yes, probably
The game doesn't call callbacks for built-in pills, cards and items. I tried to do that using `PlayerEntity:GetLastActionTriggers()`, but half of the time it doesn't include `ACTIONTRIGGER_CARDPILLUSED`/`ACTIONTRIGGER_ITEMACTIVATED`. Is there a reliable way to do that?
<@131576903722074112> is it possible to make a familiar that's basically a baby but shoots different tears?

<@145740433165647873>
Its really simple if you know basic programing, most complicated there is calculation of actual position of fly

i make you a template for a custom familiar

we can only kick through robo baby

I dont really know how to spawn my custom entity

i like arguments
this is your final warning
fantasma, all you've done is incite arguments
<@137307204024926208> not in this channel
i forgot
didnt someone do familiars
I saw many familiars made tho
so can you guys tell me, why you hate endershot so much? did he shoot JFK?
if nobody responds then most likely nobody is able to
pls
so
but I'd scam you
I mean I could be your tech support
smh don't be salty I just asked
this channel is usually more technical
we're not your tech support, we help if we're able to
can you even make familiars
and probably few people know how to do that
I said I wanted to make a passive item that spawns a familiar that shoots holy lights
this channel is getting too poisonous now see ya
we do not know the answers because the API is undocumented
keep in mind that nobody is an expert on the ab+ api, so it's not like everyone is just choosing not to help people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmINo9rimyY
no but i dont think anyone figured out how to do custom chars properly yet
>*
I need help too
You asked a question as nebulous as "how do I make a passive item", not sure what you want us to say there because there are literally thousands of different things you can do to make a passive item
maybe once discord adds subchannels there will be less crosstalk but for now we have to deal with it
is there a function for transforming grid coordinates to index? too lazy to write that myself ?
Custom characters need to replace originals?
doesn't seem like anybody here actually wants to help though
ah ok just checking
<#220581404612886528> or here
http://i.imgur.com/V3jSI3O.png
this is for both
if there a different channel where I ask for help or something this seems to be more for discussion
wait you actually tried lol?
placing towers
it's a wonder what documentation can do
is holy light even in the ab+ api
What 1/8th did you manage to get working, lol
I tried to port it to ab+ api it took me about an hour to get like 1/8th working
in that limited lua api
swift also remade greed mode
...
that's my point
took me like an hour and a half lol
I just want to make a baby that shoots holy light
I really hope Pajeet expands upon it, the idea is really interesting
like honestly, endershot asked for help, everybody ignored him and started talking about antibirth
but it's pretty cool
i don't know how long it took pajeet to do
yeah
That tower defense thingy is actually really cool
<@229593818691928067> can you help me aswell pls :D?
where you at
<@267112861921181697> i help you
<@137307204024926208> It's still modding discussion, what's your point
...
Shows the potential in antibirth's API
<@!173420370773147649> but you're just talking about how wip it is, you're not actually talking about it
but yeah look at tower defense its amazing
good spam though
<@229593818691928067> my problem is psawning the entity
No, posting all of them is nice
shouldve only posted the tower defense
I figured, I just don't lnow how I would program it
not about the mod itself
<@137307204024926208> this is about a modding api
god dammit swift dont spam
this is still modding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvQtGPAmX0
<@267112861921181697> to make a familiar: make a passive item, when it gets picked up spawn a custom entity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG_CMbw8_Nc
literally
there's a channel dedicated to antibirth
magical wizard pajeet did this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TNnS1PBrNQ&feature=youtu.be
but swift can show videos
I heard enough about it honeslty its just getting annoying now
<@267112861921181697> We're talking about modding
nah not yet
never
no to both
Is it possible to take a look at the current antibirth api?
Can we stop talking about Antibirth
<@70946604139425792>  i can't bother to, i already have apathy and i barely managed to learn two languages and spriting
<@128874748041101312>
that's awesome
and the war banner thingy
yeah
just... show pajeets tower defense
good documentation too
it's almost as robust as pre patched ab+ api and kilburn did it in two weeks
kilburn's a busy guy
<@137307204024926208> You should bother learning how to script, the barrier of entry to do basic shit in lua is very low
eh come on guys you can make cools stuff
it was worked on before ab+ was announced but work stopped after it was announced, kilburn's picking it up again
VERY WIP
how does it look ?
it's highly wip
antibirth has an api
no worries, i'm fine by myself for now
yeah
I downloaded a mod for it but it was just a reskin
im making rooms for antibirth (not for the mod, but rather as a thingy for myself)
<@66197463593136128> the antibirth one ?
i honestly just want to sprite, but i don't know how to do any coding so im just requesting requests
And i think im going to kill myself
Don't talk about it <@229593818691928067> also how to create a familiar
Im trying to spawn a custom familiar
<@221628025463111680> you needed help? ask away
i'm just messing around with antibirth api
So what are you guys working on at the moment?
what happened with EnderSHot ?
^
------ONLY MODDING DISCUSSION BELOW THIS LINE--------
Get on topic already holy shit
ANYWAY ILL FUCK OFF
honestly so
I was worried that this was gonna happen if I came back here
yeah
as this is <#205854782542315520> and all
ok thanks
go ahead, we're all about modding now
I am trying to figure out how to mod here
<@!173420370773147649> <@229593818691928067> thank you
guys what is this <#205854501083545601> ? get your shit together
Can you tell TheSwiftTiger to fuck off then
Stop shitting up the modding channel, both of you
alright
can we kick swift too?
you too pajeet
can i get kicked?
that looks similar
hmm endershot355 EnderShot
okay I'm serious, get on topic or get kicked
<@137307204024926208> pls stay
<@126426442555719680> remove update.it ?
Chill guys
do as you're told damn it
What is happening lol
no
straight up ban me
<@126426442555719680> delete update.it
just ban me
shhh it's okay
you cut it down with the rudeness jer
I AM TRYING TO BUT THEY ARE JUST MAKING ME ANGRIER
dont give endershot a platform to defend himself
<@137307204024926208> cut it out with the reaction spam
if you absolutely must argue do it elsewhere
lol
CHILL
Shut the fuck up <@128874748041101312> I told you that that was not me
let's back off and give ender a chance to overcome his emotions
but yet you know c++ now?
My dream is a new item creator
swearing is bad
I swear to fucking god
does anyone know how Ican fix the red old mod thing? It suddenly showed up on half of my mods
hey ender I thought you were mr ender "if the modding tools look like this then i am scared" shot
we chill now tho
ok
WOW
till y all chill
kk
but not so
so im leaving
i know a couple of things too
i feel too much hostility from this channel
not a lot
I'm learning how to program with c++
I know some C++
That's really cool
ya
antibirth was written on C++ wasn't it?
<@132569939969179648> None of Antibirth's items replace any preexisting items, they coexist with them
<@132627275307810817> for a familiar give it id=3 and a variant that's not in use, and subtype 0
antibirth did things that no other mod was able to do before
oooh
~~dont kill me killburn~~
antibirth was an "exe mod"
no
How antibirth added new itens? they replaced some useless shit?
rip robobabs
I want to spawn my custom familliar and this is a pain in the ass
<@132627275307810817> look in entities2.xml to see what entities have subtypes; by default it's 0
butt
sad
robo baby is dead
familiar
well not each, some dont have any
each entity has different subtypes
oh no
so you're telling us to drop it and then you continue to bring it up
NEed some help pls, what are the subtypes of an entity_
I need to make a new passive
this is still modding, sorry
<@267112861921181697> shut the fuck up
<@267112861921181697> Take it to <#205854501083545601>
anyway
???
<@!173420370773147649> they announced the DLC a long time ago, they would have time to prepare.
I added cards but now I want to add sprites
like sure it would be nice, but i think you're bitching about balacing too much when its the mod maker's choice honestly
ah i thought you meant using existing ones
I have the cards
yes
what does that help me?
do you want to add your own?
yes that's the name
if nicalis wouldnt have released another dlc we'd have a sweet ass antibirth api now
this comes from that file iirc
`hud="00_TheFool"`
how do I fix the old mod thing again?
It developed into a fuckfest of AB+ hatred
gimme a sec
there's nothing about sprites
Barely.
<@162156525337575425> this was the first thing I did^^
can you take your dumb argument to another channel pls, people are asking for help here
balance on tboi, pf
id rather not have a shitty DLC now shut the fuck up this is <#205854782542315520>
just be glad you even got another DLC, Nicalis could have just rolled in the money Afterbirth gave them
but it would be best if people who wanted their game to remain balanced could download it, yes?
just look at pocketitems.xml
it can be as op as the mod maker wants it to be
and also honestly, sure balancing and all that but its not like its actually part of the game  its a mod that people can choose if they want to download or not
does anyone know how to use this?
rip
oh plumbus allready made a green book item
lol
oh common eddi don't give me hopes
jesus christ
Why don't you guys fucking suck it up
yo thats cool looking
I can try changing the brim variant if you want
It's called Antibirth :v
thank god
There is a mod Fantasma
I'd try making them lasers instead
it's way OP and pretty obnoxious right now though
that's a cool premise <@126590786945941504>
how come there isn't a mod that just removes AB+ yet?
re: modding
ideas for improvement https://streamable.com/hebyw
about modding
Can we go back to moddnig
cains other eye but theres a layer with a few white dots behind it
they're recolors, not decolors, and plus they at least change the liquid in them
^
Yeah but they somehow managed to fuck up a recolor
you realize this one's pure black right
tilting stuff makes it look cooler
not true
triangle of ms paint sligthly tilted
lol
you realize that all of the syringes are recolours right
triangle of ms paint

"just fucking put ink into an old one"
"hey boss we need a new sprite for this"
I mean it's AA there so it looks even worse but yeah it's garbage
wow
actual ab+ sprite
ahem

not even the modding tools are that good
varicose veins is it hurts but stupid overpowered
I'm disappointed in the quality and quantity of everything in ab+
i get they gotta look isaac-y and be simple but straight up recoloring is just...
so I wouldn't know

I didn't play antibirth
jacobs ladder is 120volt but boring
like im just dissapointed in the quality of sprites in ab+
uh, yes yeah yup
dull razor's just voodoo pin from antibirth
http://orig09.deviantart.net/e1d9/f/2017/004/5/7/isaac_meme_by_thisismashot-dau8osl.png
???
make a reskin called isaac's p***ses then <:isaac_wink:259964931863085057>
dull razor is a neat item
make a reskin called isaac's pennies then
who needs new sprites
recolor it all
phew
recolor it
it was a joke
I know
thats ab+ tier creativity
no
Make a counterpart called Isaac's Blood
i'm talking about bowl of tears from antibirth
"good"
well
honestly that would make isaac's tears or whatever that item's called good
it's a monstro charge instead of a split charge
no
OK bois I just woke up, did I miss anything cool?
that's different
isaac's bowl of tears?
and isaac's tears contain pure manliness, enough to kill people with
i mean tears do contain some other stuff than normal salty water
hm
<@221628025463111680>

you realize that Isaacs tears is the same thing but in a petri dish
im amazed discord doesn't have a glass of water emote

chill
i mean that is pretty rude jerbear like rlly
I get the fucking clue
don't constantly repeat it
i'm just saying it how it is
jerbear pls
but if i use the same pallete, it's just gonna look awful
¯\_(?)_/¯
Edmund said that "gross" items would work well
they're not going to implement the cube because it's literally eden's soul
<@267112861921181697> i mean some of the items on tboi are pretty sucky op or up so honestly i think its a good enough concept for em to put it in
I want to make an item that's a body part
now i need to shade the thing part
the perspective on mine is still fucked
i guess its because of the angle?
lol
ab+ works fot me now!?!?!?!!!1
I want to make an item that has a chance of being impletmented
more importantly, it's just boring
admittedly pmk2's looks sort of weird
i'm blind
***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
lol
omg omg
I don't want it to be op or underpowered
pmk2
RRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE
rrrrrrrrrrrrr
pmk2
like if they want an op thing they will download the op thing
pmk2
Yo folks
i mean honestly it also depends on the person who downloads the mod you know?
Maybe it increases the charges required when used more

it
maybe remove it?
rework
maybe make it a chance to get hurt instead of always?
remove it
make up your god darn mind
well its either fucking terrible or 2 op
and their version is OP as shit too
cal mug of bumbo
How should I make it so it isn't overpowered
they're effectively the same
http://i.imgur.com/mmk7wC0.png
i regret it
i encountered big horn for the first time
actually that would make it a pretty bad item ender
okay im calm <:isaac_cute:231218432148766720>
Maybe I should make it so theres a chance that you get hurt when you fail it?
what you just made
calm down man
<:isaac_shoop:231218479607316480> I DON'T GET CUBES
WHAT THE FUCK IS EDEN'S SOUL
giving someone a bunch of items for no risk or skill is a bit much I think
ahem
i-i I DON'T GET IT
the item you just made
and learn
look at it
Whats Eden's soul
<@!173420370773147649> wizardry
you made eden's soul
but honestly, if you got a battery sinergy you can already break the game
so it's eden's soul

<@137307204024926208>
I could increase the range of unscrambles
yeah i mentioned that before
unless you have a battery synergy
Yeah fantasma
well i mean its a free item every what 15-30 rooms?
you have to wait a long time before getting an item
cool
even more broken
Or you could void it
oh it's an item which makes you extremely op with many more items
Basically
it's an item which makes you wait longer and give up your active before you get an item
Then using it again resets the count
so
if its unscrambled, you get an item
you have to use it 5 to 10 times to "unscramble" it
i tried making a cube once, it didn't work
yeah the cube
The cube? or something else
i don't understand tri dimensional two dimensional sprites
what does it do? what does it mean a chance to get a free item?
ooh that sprite looks nice
If you want to see how shitty my skill level is
im sad this meem didn't catch on ? me throwing my sadness off
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836666550
Oh heres my first mod
i got thrown off general into modding and they're being pretty general
What was your question again prob
britain not europe anymore Kappa
Anyway a will allow myself to repost dem qyestion: "Oi mates i have question
I want to make person like familiar, that will have sprites for facing up down left right, how do?
Kinda like shadow person that is always behind isaac"
<#205854782542315520> goes somewhere other than modding
and once again
dae europe = britain
wow, a low blow
just saying but "cheeky cunts" is so European xD no offense intended
does anyone know how to change card sprites? or a mod that does that?
etc and help me with my problem? XD
and make them rarer
also make the sprites darker
Can we stop being cheeky cunts about "races
*shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*
Ah, the phrasing there is quite similar, I am surprised not knowing it myself, since I am polish myself.
<@66197463593136128> wouldn't that make spirit hearts black hearts?
that seems cool jerb
i mean there's also racism in stereotyping
make spirit hearts do a necronomicon effect when they get lost
do you know zatherz IRL
yeah see? he readed polish
Racism is when I put my own race above others
GET FUCKED
HAH
Sorry to dissapoint you mates but i'm from poland :C
I know
that's australia a little to the right
smh
endershot you are being very racist
or from scum vullage
smh
maybe he's a zealander
Sorry I am good at reading accents
:V
yeah but, he reads australian
"Oi mates|
"How Do?"
Phrasing
how does he sound australian
he's typing
holy shit <@220525353830055936> you sound so austrailian
im not particularly sure of what you mean problematic
possibly a costume?
like the entire series?
Oi mates i have question
I want to make person like familiar, that will have sprites for facing up down left right, how do?
Kinda like shadow person that is always behind isaac
I would download friends
you wouldn't download a family
see how I can do that.
I'm gonna go download some familiars
well, yes but a lot of stuff makes spider ass useless
Need help with .spawn and familiars
I dont really know what to put on variant and subtype
butt
That would make spider butt useless then
(slow+a bit of damage)
spider heart
plus it could be spider butt's effect
that's what I was thinking
^
how do black hearts apply their effect? could you use the same principle?
o
Like, when losing a spirit heart all enemies are slowed or confused
what do you mean more use
How do I create a passive item that gives Spirit Hearts more use?
got the d6 as cain
GOOD FOR YOU
COOL
AGAAIN
I HAVE RETURNED
in the pocketitems.xml is nothing about sprites
were do you define which cards should use which sprites?
well looking at references is the quickest way to learn to program yeah
That too
is to learn to program
Is download other people's stuff and see how they did it
The easiest way to learn how to make items
I've decided
so if you're really good at getting hit you could kill the final bosses without attacking
so each time that smelted heart gets hit it adds another 40 damage
yeah like the black heart damage is 40
it stacks all your hearts on top of each other and that new heart takes the same amount of hits to deplete
but every black heart you smelt it doubles the effect
make a smelter but for hearts
true
just combine them
no that's pink hearts
it played a little animation and charmed all the enemies
instead of just damaging the enemies when you got hit
the risk/rewards of isaac
what if black hearts like
risk/reward item
risk/rewards the name of the game
yeah
mm yes
so if you want to keep going it's risky but you get black hearts
where every 3 enemies it spawns a black heart
a void
how about
like
wait how about something that spawns black hearts
or make them poison enemies
make it additionally spawn voids sometimes
like
yeah
Maybe have some more effect when black hearts are destroyed
black hearts can make or break a run
hmm yeah
black hearts are cool
make something involving black hearts
I wanna make a passive item today
What mod should I spend five hours on today?
heyho
welcome back
Hey
i got it somewhat, but not really
btw, has anyone of you figured out how to get a config item?
It's nothing that a good tutorial can be made for
hackyness is a necessarity
Well, that's disingenuous of me to say; they understand the API better than anyone else, but the things they want to do require hackish workarounds rather
Dammit Edmund and your inability to explain anything
<@70946604139425792> you simply cannot use that API efficiant.
As in, without doing everything hackishly
whats up
Heyho everyone! im back
Any tutorials on YouTube because I can't find any.
<@70946604139425792> Yup fixed it, still wont work
Oooo
ye

I'm crying
Same
Hopefully they fix the achievements for cosmetic mods soon
Because I want to listen to some vanilla isaac music while playing
I was there like 20 min ago
Weird
Hmmm
yep, website looks down to me too
Is modding of isaac down for you?
I'm Brazilian
It's okay, I'm not perfect too ya know :p
Srry for the bad english guys haha
Modding of isaac is down?
When I'll get my hands on modding I know my first objective 

Replace the "The World" sentence when activating card by Dio screaming "ZA WARUDO!"

Yeah, idk icerzz, maybe
last update pretty much fucked it up so idk
Maybe is the modloader that i'm using?
weird ._.
Yes
ab+?
But i have mods like the final fantasy theme when killing a boss, a extra rooms mod, the charge bars for brimstone etc, and i still getting achievements.
lazy**
There are just wayy too many files and im laz
Question : is there an easier/quicker way to replace enemies on greed mode?
I'm sorry I am a pure beginner in modding ^^"
icerzz : ???
well back to test my sprites again!
portal chan : AH! I feel same as you!
Hey spark, try a modloader
tell that to edmund "colored hud? your achievements are shut" mac millen
But there are workarounds so it's still playable
They updated Rebirth's executable and it breaks Antibirth under certain circumstances
I can understand this for OP items but not for those graphic mods I want my achievement back ?
<@70946604139425792> But  Antibirth isn't even in AB?
okey
no one has a clue, you can sort of do it but they show up invisible in menu
Narx : I dunno if possible rn
It also breaks all mods created before AB+, except Antibirth
and what about making new chars?
Wow
their amazing mod support DLC disables achievements for all mods
Aw :c
yup
I have 3-4 small graphic mods, is it the reason I can't get achievements? If yes, how to fix that? I want my 1001% back x)
¯\_(?)_/¯
So the mod support for afterbirth+ its just for testing resprites or stat edits on normal items?
as of now, you can make items but you cant add them to item pools which makes it worthless p much
and then make the resprite
like a copy of isaac (4 example)
Idk :v
Its possible to create new characters?
I'm new at modding, i just wanna know if its possible to create new itens
Hey!
I confirm !
it worked!
yeeeah
<@174193097285173250> Oh God, i love you, i can continue my 0 to 1001% with Antibirth OST !
i'll try in order to notice mods again
I think it's because if you ran the resource unpacker and updated isaac, all the resources would be outdated, right?
so he's just removing packed
yeah it works because the game only loads from unpacked if it can't find packed
I use ShareX
thanks i'll try
is this a legit method to get achievements back ?
?
How do you rec, that short demos tho
https://streamable.com/hebyw
anyone figured out how to use SaveModData()?
is player:GetShootingJoystick() correct?
true
And I doubt the author had anything against it ;D
yeah i know i know ^^
The community wanted it for a long time
And, well, "stole" the idea
It's Found HUD now
he just stole the idea ?
custom made by tyrone
its not the official missing hud
is AB+ bundled with missing hud? i've seen it on the official screenshots of it
np
Thank you ?
oke ^^
ill take a look at that
doesnt matter
well
Reminds me of Orbiting + Ludovico
then position and velocity
but
hm
if you dont want him to follow you look at EntityFamiliar
k thank you
oh
it follows you automaticly. only shooting is manually coded by you
https://gfycat.com/WarpedSaneGentoopenguin
right?
and shoots
http://i.imgur.com/fINSvd9.png
and then i should do something so it follows isaac
<@132627275307810817> yeah
in entityPlayer
<@220525353830055936> GetShootingJoystick()
Hi <@!152984637264756736> Only1412hours
<@109624258317033472> last question, is .spawn the only way to spawn an entitity?
<@109624258317033472> i heard joystick vector inputs is somthing we can use but i didnt foud any documentation about it
i dont know what it returns when you do nothing, try it out
<@220525353830055936> maybe player:getaimdirection
ffs
if we could see the base game items this would be much easier
<@220525353830055936> . Thats... problematic. Since we dont have inout yet. but i guess there could be some ways, let me brows the docs
Anybody wants to create a sprite for brimbombs? (Passive item, makes bombs have spinning short-ranged brimstone beams)
Do i need to use .spawn then?
you dont necessrily havea to, you can also spawn it in
just take a look at workshop items
Do i need to create an item?
I have the entity
I dont know how familliars work neither
you need a custom entity
<@109624258317033472> I mean that somthing triggers when you hold fire for at least 3 sec and then relase just like maw of void
about psawning a familliar
I cant findnothing on the docs
I dont know how to do that
<@132627275307810817> what exactly is the problem?
lol
Other rant on the side: im getting translation requests with pretranslated strings for the dice room descriptions mod. so far so good. Only problem is, that all of them only have 5/6 dicefaces translated -.-
Cant find a way to spawn a custom familiar
Need help guys
what do you mean by Maw Of Void like trigger
Very PUNnny but for the real tho, anyone?
hi hi
i would take a stab at it but im still learning how to cut
Did anyone take stab at creating Maw of Void like trigger
These days I was making a mod, but now I cannot test the sprites cuz now with the new update they are not showed in game and Idk why, also some of workshop mods I downloaded stopped working.
Any help?
that and the blood diharrea thingy that someone made
ofc you have wofsauges chargebars and item descriptions but thats beyond something that'll be added so
like so far out of mods the coolest thing i can think of someone doing is that axe item
but not really somethign i'd like
could be possible that antibirth and godmode become part of the real game. that'd be pretty neat tbh
with the mods ive seen so far... *shudders*
best mod becomes part of the actual game?
also, is AB+ getting a monthly update
no its just because i have no $$$ lmao
good decision
i use it  a lot, not getting AB+ anytime soon tho
?
just realizing now that you made isaac character editor
so even that method doesnt work now
they flat out disabled resource loading like that
but
item pools can be edited but then the mod wont be compatible with any other that adds items
nicalis didnt respond to my email yesterday, here's hoping for them seeing it today
honestly the biggest mystery for me are still item pools
anyways. im downloading skyrim again right now. thats it for some modding for the next days.
adding costumes to chars
well there is 1 big achievement
¯\_(?)_/¯
external item descriptions doesnt work with achievements since i wrote it in lua -.- why nicalis why -.-
Isaac Character Editor would of been so good with it as well
atleast yours works without achievements... they flat out killed isaac character editor
i made a big achievement by making a mod that has 800 lines of code. only problem is: its fucking useless without achievements ...
The modding community hasn't made much achievements recently though.. :3
thats good
Hard but steady
how is moddin goin
Double outline? It looks so bulky T_T
hi
like so
needs a double outline to be isaac-styled
Ref img
http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/8/88/Bow%26ArrowAV.png/revision/latest?cb=20160502093738
What do you think?

let's juust make the enable achievements mod
I mean, hopefully it will be. It is still just the first week.
welcome <@139145760280150016> haha
it is
AND HERE I AM THINKING HOW STUPID MY THOUGHTS WERE
that's not very kawaii of you
?
and here i was thinking that since modding is already easy to do on afterbirth, it would be easier and modding in general would be better in afterbirth+
yup
and i have the right to call his decisions fucking stupid
he has the right to be selfish though
sure
harsh but I don't disagree
^
who only cares about themselves
anyone who restricts singleplayer experiences like that is a selfish prick
Hey man, I like messing around with plat god, but I suck at the game so I'd never reach it
its pointless arguing about this
dude
\o/
esp when any fuckface can download a 100% save without a care in the world
*matter
yeah and i think ed is completely fucking stupid when it comes to that regard
Yeah, that's true
Without any official way to remove them
well Ed wants them to experience the game HE designed
My account
<@124088844181045249> Only one slot for steam achievements
they'll never get to use mods i get it
<@126590786945941504> Then again, you have 3 slots ?
so?
<@162156525337575425> you have to take into consideration new players will play the game from scratch, with AB+
I sometimes like messing around with extreme OP and beautiful synergies but want to keep my achievements separate
an opt-in to enable achievments with mods is a good idea
like he did THE LAST TIME
...people already could use OP mods and no experiences were ruined
i'm sure nicalis will change his mind considering there are so many upset about it
imo
That is the best case scenario
Now somebody email nicalis
Yeah
yeah
But include a switch in the settings
make it configurable
By default disable achievements when mods are on
<@229593818691928067> Then that's their problem
So I'd propose the following:
I don't want to get achievements when I'm messing with mods
<@124088844181045249> people will use OP mods, or in any case mods that Ed didn't approve so he wants to control the game experience (in terms of unlocks and all)
<@139145760280150016> yes, but doing anything advanced is a pain in the ass
Another thing
If you care about achievements don't simply use op mods for your own sake
its a singleplayer game.
does AB+ atleast allow you to create new stuff instead of just editing the old stuff we already have?
dont force your opinion of what fun is down others throats
newsflash: not all people care about that
<@229593818691928067> Then don't use OP mods
legitimately unlocking/finding the new content
ab+ is a reduced game experience
FailFish
just for unlocking stuff from you owb mod
what fucking reduced game experience
The game's achievements are integrated with steam
<@!173420370773147649> very few people would actually cheat, but most people would have a reduced game experience
not on steam wtf
It's very simple to unlock everything if you wish
Good fucking luck with that on steam
i want a mod where i can actually get achievement
<@120355885615808512> Custom achievements?
I mean, yeah, it makes no sense that it disables achievements
good fucking luck
>this api >anything custom
<@160798627910909953> Not sure if there is a way currently
yes and I want freaking custom achievements
cheat engine isnt gonna let you have a full mod
steam achievement manager
mh, i can't find any way to toggle shaders with lua ?
pm2k, dunno what SAM is but
this only discourages people from using mods
they're willing to make cosmetics mods not disable achievments though
no point doing it with mods
i mean, if someone wants to cheat achievements they can do so anyway
if you wanna cheat you can just use cheat engine or SAM
no
well it's understandable
mods in a modding dlc disable achievements
thats bull
yes they do
mods on AB+ disable achievements i heard?!?!
but
so, i didnt get AB+ yet
ah alright
accidentally got the blank card + jera + battery pickup infinite combo while testing my mod
And no, it doesn't work with bob's brain, I explicitely check for bombs
The game can't handle it http://i.imgur.com/sy3yEOM.png
bob's brain would become super good
does it work with bomb synergies ? like bob's brain and such
I wonder if the game can handle 300
that's pretty
Here it is with 30 http://i.imgur.com/6TSbkpt.png
It also supports arbitrary amount of beams http://i.imgur.com/0LyCzxo.png
They shouldn't even be in sync, but they are for some reason
I should add random offset http://i.imgur.com/DVQrBdr.png
is  this true that the new patch even disables achievements when the mod is in the resources folder ?
yep, it does
It should
Well
what if you have remote detonator, would it fire brimstone forever ? :p
hey it works! <@126590786945941504>
what is EntityLaser.BounceLaser ? it's nil right now, how would i bounce the laser off the wall ?
https://streamable.com/6oyo3

<@132192021984051201> Noice Sprite. I have never heard of that place they good?
Niice
That works
Thanks
Hmm
<@229593818691928067> Thanks, as you know the current state of Isaac documentation isnt perfect
My item makes good use of it ? Pretty confident it works
don't trust the documentation haha
<@126590786945941504> yes it works
<@220525353830055936> yeah you can access player:GetFireDirection()
I used it
It is..
<@229593818691928067> That doesn't sound writable based on documentation
<@126590786945941504> you might could need EntityLaser.DisableFollowParent = true no ?
Can't see why it wouldn't
Does modyfing entity based on wich way isaac is facing is possible?
Secret :P
<@126590786945941504> What is your item you working on tho?
Yep, it works
Ah, I think `ParentOffset` works
looks cool
oh no
XD
If you use Position, it'll keep rapidly alternating between normally spinning around the player and, well, http://i.imgur.com/fWqglCi.png
You need to do PositionOffset, but hten the shadows are wrong
Yes, but if you do Position, it doesn't work right
i saw rotation parameters on the EntityLaser, haven't tried them
update it every tick
And have the shadows aligned witht he brimstone
And track the entity
I also need it to spin
my bad
Yes
ah you mean from an entity but NOT damaging the player ?
Instead of `-`?
Why are you using :__sub
Also
**From** the entity
<@229593818691928067> Again, wrong
here's to shoot from the player to an entity, damaging the entity but not the player
```local dir = npc.Position:__sub(player.Position):GetAngleDegrees()
local brim = EntityLaser.ShootAngle(1, player.Position, dir, 30, Vector(0, 0), player)```
for those interested, 1 grid tile is position wise 40x40
```player.Damage = player.Damage*0.4

local brimstoneShot = player:FireBrimstone(tearDirectionVector)
brimstoneShot.DisableFollowParent = true
brimstoneShot.Position = entities[i].Position
brimstoneShot.Angle = math.atan(closestEnemyPosition.Y, closestEnemyPosition.X)
brimstoneShot.AngleDegrees = math.atan(closestEnemyPosition.Y-brimstoneShot.Position.Y, closestEnemyPosition.X-brimstoneShot.Position.X)*180/math.pi
```
I'll send you my code
I need to shoot from an entity somewhere **without** damaging the player
I mean, I managed to get the brimstone to work properly
```local dir = player.Position:__sub(npc.Position):GetAngleDegrees()
        local brim = EntityLaser.ShootAngle(1, npc.Position, dir, 30, Vector(0, 0), npc)```
here's how i shoot from an entity to the player, damaging the player
say what ?
It either goes everywhere except where it should or the shadows are fucked
Or rather
And the brimstone went everywhere except where it should
ahhh now i understand it ? i thought something like "my mod is 5 times good idea"
I'm not an idiot, I tried that
Dude
Vector SourcePos is where the brim starts
But the brim isn't positioned on the player
I think he's asking if you can do what the mod does for consumables as well, at that your mod is a 5 star mod and that you should keep up the good owrk
That's exactly what I was doing
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mh7pp/how_to_make_an_entity_shoot_brimstone/
If you looked at the code
*sigh*
<@126590786945941504> make the last argument the player
If I do that then the shadow draws vertically at the player's position
Did you try setting the player as the parent?
can someone translate this for me into something understandable ? i dont know what he wants ?
EntityCollisionClass doesn't appear to work on brim
i could use that for my ricochet tears
It's an attribute of Entity
I'll see that
h,
http://i.imgur.com/iKpjyx5.png
But I guess I could try
I mean, that's what I did before and the effects were... Undescribable
What about EnityCollisionClass
maybe make it's initial position the offset position and just making the offset 0?
`local brim = EntityLaser.ShootAngle(1, v.Position, 0, 10, v.Position-ply.Position, ply)`
how are you firing the brimstone?
I think its about ownership of that brimstone
If I set the player as the source and use the offset, the shadow isn't offset
Would anybody happen to know how to create a brimstone that doesn't hurt the player?
is joystick input described in documentation somwhere?
thank
but its cool tho
jesus, it looks like its going to kill you in your sleep
<@128545421579517952> https://i.gyazo.com/4d610b0b8dc7261cc1a3addb12f2db2b.png i tried
nop. joystick input exists tho
Don't think so
So i may ask again is there any callback on button press? I want to make Maw of Void like trigger
Oh "attempt to call a nil value (method 'isVulnerableEnemy')" :V thanks
¯\_(?)_/¯
Check your log.txt
I cant find where is misstake is there: http://pastebin.com/JnrdZ79w I mean on pickup part works but update tick part wont trigger?
oh god

oh no
Ok. Found it. It called "calm"
Hey guys. Do anyone know the name of the track after you kill the boss.
those toys that have a string which when you pull it it says something
ah
not for any item in particular just. something to sprite i guess
like any sprite
anything
what's the item
someone give me a sprite idea for an item
yup that works, thank you
The problem was that I set my variable wrong tho :P
slightly glitchy in large rooms though
I did upload a debug mod to the workshop that shows the type, variant, and subtype of every non-effect entity on-screen
so i do {first parameter}.Type?
oh
most reliable way would be just check entity.Type == 1
yeah, thing is, I'm not entirely sure GetPlayer(0) will return the same entity every time it's called
Ah.
anyone?
Back when I was trying to figure out why isn't it recognizing bombs and started logging the bomb type every tick
what are those 4s for anyways

I can do that
Im trying to find a way to spawn a familiar with an active item
knew it
Nope
lemme guess NOT in NSW?
ayyyy a fellow australian

Is that a Tammy's Head that fires Rubber Cement piercing tears?
Anyway, what about this? https://streamable.com/patki
hm. why would this not be doing anything
nah, but it is a fairly obvious idea, really, I think
if room:IsFirstVisit() and current_room ~= room:GetSpawnSeed() then
    current_room = room:GetSpawnSeed();
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_D10, false)
        player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_D12, false)
        player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_D20, false)
  end
because great minds think alike ?
haha, it's great
why'd we have like the same idea for an item ;-;
and made it rubbery
i basically took inner eye, removed the shininess, and made the pupil look less human
<@72413153614368768> https://t.co/kzz4iutkDa ? looks almost exact to your item. Bit funny
noice
<@72413153614368768> tada

code not console
Has anyone gotten GridSpawn to work?
when you spawn entities through the debug menu you spawn them like Type.Variant.Subtype
entities have types, subtypes and variants
ty
that makes sense
ok
oh
for example, a tooth tear is a variant of the tear entity
so type gives the general type of an entity, variants are still the same entity but is different from the base entity
and then spawn it
by creating an entity
variants are basically narrowing down a type even further
i mean
and can i spawn a custom familiar using this?
whats the difference between GetEntityVariantByName and GetEntityTypeByName?
Mod idea
Nope
<@126590786945941504> sprite idea?
if I just put a number, it crashes the game
sure, that sounds good
ohh I've got an idea
what the fuck
thats fine. maybe like a... rubber eye or something?
`[Mod] Error in MC_NPC_UPDATE call: .../My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/mod/main.lua:34: bad argument #4 to 'FireProjectiles' (number expected, got userdata)`
sorry lol
i'm awful at spriting and ideas for spriting
Alternatively maybe WeaponType?
any ideas for what you want the sprite to be?
¯\_(?)_/¯
I tihnk it might be DamageFlags
shrug
cause both of them are completely broken
and it needs an int instead of ProjectileParams
i mean tbh i probably should've fixed the normal tears before making a whole new synergy
ProjectileMode isn't in the docs
alright
i can also whip up an item sprite if u want <@72413153614368768> i can give it a shot
but they literally don't work
those are enemy tears I believe
has anyone tried to use any of these
when the player STARTS shooting, set the counter to 0
set it 0 when the player shoots and count each ricochet
but how would i reset that number when the player shoots
i suppose i could
can you at least count the ricochets?
ah shit
since brimstone lasers count as the player dealing damage
i could try spriting
you can't check if it's a brimstone laser that's firing
and that's not possible, unfortunately
yeah i'm awful at spriting
if (brimstoneLaser && ricochet == 0) ricochet() ricochet +1
add a counter if its a brimstone laser
cool
OH, i didnt even see the Text in the Hud on the right, great Item Icon :p
it's a synergy
did you change Brimstone, or is it a new item?
although i really need to make it only able to ricochet once per laser
it's a ricochet tears item
yeah
is that a passive?
its like borderlands 2's conference call
rad!
looks cool tho!
definetly is  ?
i think my custom item's slightly too powerful https://streamable.com/t1xx6
s'cool
slept quite long. woops
good morning from germany, where its 13.43 ?
are there any changelogs?
Isaac updated?
good morning from aus, where its 11:42pm
ay
Good morning everyone
...........thank you... bless you.....i hope nice things happen to you
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mh6wt/adding_and_animating_custom_entities/
there's a thread with a tutorial for that
So, who was it that knows how to make custom entities?
ok
which you have to enable with tab or whatever
the next time you run it
I did that
and then in-game it should appear in the Mods list
thats where you paste it in
you gotta find a folder called Afterbirth+ Mods
but my custom players.xml is working
there's a reddit thread about players.xml breaking
when you get to the my games folder do you just paste your mods in
uh
? ?
ok thank you so much
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mh7pp/how_to_make_an_entity_shoot_brimstone/
back
read jean's tutorial
How do I use it though?
delay is just the time between the next shot
it's listed as member when it's static
im assuming MaxFireDelay is the absolute maximum the delay can get
never mind
actually no
why is ShootAngle's description "static helper to simplify spawning lasers" when it just confuses me more
lemme think about how to explain it
maxfiredelay might be a temporary value
hmm
so nobody knows the difference between MaxFireDelay and FireDelay?
it probably depends on the VAriant
<@229593818691928067> damn!! nice!
adversary, that rusty fuck
i made this explanation of ShootAngle https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mh7pp/how_to_make_an_entity_shoot_brimstone/
there's a boss that bends a brimstone laser right
you just paste it in right
is there a way to bend a brimstone shot via Lua
ayy
hello.
hi !
there's a folder in your Documents, in My Games
<@174306880787709958> they go in My Documents -> My Games -> Binding of Isaac + or w.e. Mods +
Why would it return an EntityLaser otherwise
I know you must get this all the time, but I don't know how to install my mods
at least I believe so
thanks
alright
ah
yeah
you use ShootAngle to spawn the laser, don't you
it's in degrees, not radians
oh crap
I'm putting all that in but the angle's not changing
offset is how far away from the source pos you want it, im assuming
I believe nil is valid for source
the variant is the type of laser, the position and angle determing from where and in what direction, the timeout is how long it will last, I don't know what the offset is, and the source is whatever it is that's shooting the laser
oh, thanks! apparently i am just blind
EntityLaser& EntityLaser::ShootAngle    (    integer     Variant,
Vector     SourcePos,
float     AngleDegrees,
integer     Timeout,
Vector     PosOffset,
Entity     Source 
)
<@160798627910909953> steam workshop -> collections
it takes all the relevant variables to shoot a laser at an angle
couldn't find them in the workshop or on disk
where are the example mods located?
ShootAngle() has like 6 things you can put in it
yeah the tilt shifty thing
<@160798627910909953> isn't there an example mod with a changed shader?
so EntityLaser:ShootAngle(45)
did they fix range and firedelay in the new update?
u gotta put the angle in the brackets
do we know the difference between FireDelay and MaxFireDelay?
I'm trying to use it and it doesn't seem to do a single thing.
how does EntityLaser:ShootAngle() work?
i saw someone with a tilt shift thing going on
actually... maybe its already in there
maybe shoot him a tweet asking for shader support?
considering ed is taking feedback and implementing it im sure he will
the mod tools make me kind of sad, maybe they will be expanded to be more useful later on
yeah
like a color correction type of deal that reduces saturation...
yeah, don't think there is a way to add shaders either
i cant think of a way to do that without a post processing effect
that could be an issue
don't think hardcoding would work for that
yeah, but i wanted an item that briefly brings the player into a black/white version of the room without enemies except phased ghosts
> resources > gfx > grid
youd probably have to switch the gfx of the floor itself
no, background/wall/clouds and so on. Like basement->burning basement or something
??
you mean music theme
even room:SetFloorColor() seems broken atm so I am not too hopeful
is there a way to change the floor theme via lua?
ayyyyy
Hey y'all!
seeya later!
shrug up to you!!
I might make the golden battery later if you really want it
im not a cookj
I have to go for now
erm
idk
when isn't carbonara creamy?
also creamy bacon carbonara is the BEST
hopefully the mod api will improve more
ye
:/ shame
not that i've been aware of no
So, has anyone managed to edit tear entities?
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/4257/products/9545_HR12__00913.1400693684.1280.1280.jpeg?v=1404142501
wtf is a brown cap
use the fps luke
yeah that's it
btw my new favorite item, is jacobs ladder
modify passives in the cache callback
but that means the effects are occuring every frame
not sure tho
i think you code a passive with the player fps
like ```player.range = player.range + 1```
have they made a callback for passives and if not... how do u code a passive
Not sure in which callback you should do that though, wasn't messing around with that yet.
in if i wanna add range it's the same ?
oh thanks
shit is it that easy?
`player.Damage = player.Damage + 1`
ain't there a way ?
well no, i think in the recent update there actually is a way to add stats up
i think a workaround is to use pilleffects?
what is the code for damage up for instance ?
?
o_o really.
I tried it with my mod and some users complained
btw what's the method to add stats up now ?
and doesn't always work for other users
oh yeah
they seem to be improving the doco too
you can include files but it's tricky
it has documentation issues too but at least it actually makes sense
all my 80 new item and 2 new charachters in one file
yeah the fact that all your code are supposed to be in main.lua makes it verry hard to keep up with if you'r creating big mods
needs to be more like Starbound
im confident theyll improve it as they gain more feedback
the tall room with 2 portals at the top can go fuck itself, k thx
the way mods work right now is ridiculously inefficient
so wait dont u have to include all your code in main.lua? how do you tell it that you're making an item or a character
is pretty much why I was messing around with hacky ways to hide the health bar
Yours sound good tho hmmm electric golem sounds amazing
so soy milk but randomized
My idea is a bit different
risk vs reward
yes
massively gimps*
is basically a golem
no my bad
How about a 12 charge that massively boosts 1 of your stats but gimps another one
Your working on a character with charges for health? I had the same idea
from any pool
with anything
it randomly picks an item you have and swaps it
mega blast is a 0 charge
Wait
passive item***
The thing is 12 charges items are op but not too op I mean look at mega blast
how about a 12 charge that takes a passive character and swaps it with another one
gimme 10 minutes before I start
erm
the new character I started working on basically has a battery meter instead of health and item charges
GO FORTH AND CREATE
***cyka blyat***
GOOD
And now that you said it
if you find some batterys it's like
You do realise that can be done
golden batteries
oh god
it's like one floor if you clean
someone make golden batteries
12 charge is not much
oh wow, there's a max?
honestly eveyrthing sounds op here
Not a bad idea
Battery only recharges 6 charges not 12
lil satan
...12 charge that takes a random devil deal, heart cost included
e x ac t ly
battery op
maybe a 6 charge dmg up
Just remember to apply it in the cache
im sticking with my 12 charge all stats up
red heart or if you don't have any, blue
loose one heart every time you use
Sounds extremely op it would need a pay off
what? it's a serious suggestion
Ok let's stop
the box of friends but permanent
But seriously if I'm gonna make a mod it needs at least one 12 charge item
:D
passive item that gives you the appearance of Robbie Rotten
are we all 12 here?
no more meme mods, please
... voiding diplopia would be super silly
The universe breaks
Don't ask
then void the void
... what happens if you diplopia void
Is this a new meme
We shall call it "12 Charge"
a 12 charge that executes arbitrary code
12 charge that litterly just recharges the 12 charge
pushes away enemies
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/v5exlib08te41tw/2017-01-07_12-37-35.webm
a 12 charge active that enables every mod
BTW I made a shitty thing
thanks
lol fucking mod auto enabled
Check your enabled mods
now I am become Touhou
someone gave it the succ
tiltshift example mod
I mean mega blast is basically does that
why does my game look like that?

a spell card
what about
it just bounces all around the walls at rapid speed
NO
what about an active that shoots one fast, huge tear with rubber cement
just count the amount of hits and misses while lightning round is active. if both counters are 0 at the end of lightning round, pedestal
Jk
I got one "gun" you litterly just just shoot a godamn bullet with insane knock back and it just destroys any enemy and does a lot of damage to bosses
unpossible
AND!! at the end of lightning round if the player took no damage and didnt miss a single shot, bam, pedestal item
yes only its 100% guaranteed
Plus brimstone
lol
BECAUSE THE BIBLE COMMANDS IT
Kinda like glitter bombs and dr. fetus
W H Y
And mutant spider
Y E S
no.
AND IPECAC
and 20/20
lol that plus soy milk
only for like 10 seconds
hearts, coins, keys, runes, cards
<@126590786945941504> A workaround is setting player damage to 0 before firing. then setting it back
a 12 charge item that when used, causes every tear hit to drop an item
YOU'VE GOT IT
_Lightning Round_
IVE GOT IT
how's it going zeta
Still deals damage
Doesn't work
also, fire brimstone and set contact damage to zero
12 charge item that maxes your health then maxes your soul hearts?
Anybody knows how to make a non-damaging brim?
12 charge item that grants golden bombs
OR
ye
Ye otherwise too op
only by 1 tho
home at last
a 12 charge item that increases all stats
im baaack
I'm thinking of another 12 room recharge item I love them so much anybody got any ideas?
wow, this editor is much worse than the basement renovator
Ok, thanks!
YEAH
Okay, so the last part. Import from the resources/rooms folder.
I do have them extracted
Wait
wait, nvm
"You need the resources extracted. You need to have the directory set to the resources folder. You need to import the binaries from the resources/rooms folder."
ffs
Now what
<@!193893570061533184>. The resources folder. Set the directory to *that*.
and nothing shows up when I import the binarys
help
what about a trinket that has a random chance to spawn a golden bomb
I get this error when I try and open the room editor
Item Idea: A Bindle passive/active item that basically acts like Book of Sin, dropping random consumable.  It is....The Bindle-ing of Issac.
Is there an AB+ version of the Basement Rnovator anywhere?
Ok, this room editor isnt working
oh ok
"To my knowledge", I guess.
what's generally mean though
rad
Generally, yes.
have people figured out how to do passive items yet?
Well I just did it and nothing popped up
Nope. If you're referring to me.
do I need to wait a long time or something?
ok I did that but nothing happened
You need the resources extracted. You need to have the directory set to the resources folder. You need to import the binaries from the resources/rooms folder.
then you just select the category and rooms from the panels on the left
yes?
do you have the room editor open without errors?
how do I open rooms in the room editor?
ok
Yeah, I was thinking of making a sort of multi-charged Holy Mantle that was per-floor instead of per-room.
yeah that sure does, one of the things i wanted to do was add some more golden heart type container modifiers
I can't seem to do something as simple as get what floor I'm on. That seems like it'd be easy enough to add.
at least its being updated
doesn't seem well handled in the first place so it's probably hard to expand upon
it's pretty weird as it is though
Yeah, I expect they'll expand it.
indeed, but cut them some slack, only had a year to work on it and it had only been done for like a week before release
That's a shame. Seems extremely limited as it is.
even though they're referenced in the documentation
pretty much lots of classes aren't implemented in the api
So do we not have access to any classes outside the Isaac namespace, even for reading?
https://i.gyazo.com/39f55c23ba6d0fd75639c0a78e2de933.png custom challenge creating is fun
nevermind
Also, is the room editor any good?
How do I get the room files?
?
noice
nice

goodnight everyone
ty btw
Adds a function `log` that logs a message on your screen
https://hastebin.com/unifanahix.lua
And if you want quick debugging, just use LogMod
doesn't work in notepad++ for me
notepad++ does that also
If the editor is any good
It'll autoupdate every time you get a change
Oh ffs, just open your log in sublime or something
ah there is
source: https://hastebin.com/unujolowuj.cs
a program so that you don't have to open the log file every time you get an error or print something
put it where your log is, so Documents/Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+
Isn't there a `Type` field?
making items is one of the few things you can do with these mod tools, you can likely find decent examples on the workshop
Hello, how would one go about checking what an entity is?
Can you make items with the mod tools yet? Anyone figure that out?
Yeah
then I wouldn't care about sleeping
it would be nice if you could just hop out of bed fully awake after sleeping
Why can't I just finish sleeping but skip the waking up part
Yep
as waking up is nothing but pain, would be nice to get less of that
I wish I could be like that other guy I talk to all the time who can literally stay awake for 48 hours
that's almost exactly me
my sleep schedule is a train wreck
I tell myself that but I always end up getting like no sleep on weekdays, and on weekends, I got to bed around 4 in the morning and wake up around noon
it's the weekend so I stay up however long I desire
sleep is for the weekdays
Sleep is for the weak(ends)
sleep
bruh
take that future self
and torture your future self who has to wake up in 2 hours
i know i have a game to code but there's AB+ unlocks to get!!!
when you can just decide to, instead of going to bed when you're really tired, do your work then
who needs to spend precious free time doing work
**adult**
i could do homework instead
ugh but like
exactly
sounds like me with animal crossing as a kid
but I go long stretches of time between each session
to be fair 300 hours is a lot
Basically I just have really long play sessions with it
after wasting 300 hours in a super short time on that game I have never really gotten into it again sadly
i can't really get into playing it a lot
it's p good
I just bought Stardew Valley a couple weeks ago and *god* it's so good
yay
This means cache update should work fine now!
`Fixed const-ness of player entity passed to certain callbacks `
In the latest update
guys
oh
relatable
reletable
https://i.gyazo.com/a2239ee5e839f116d10d364bd688995e.png
grr
who's putting dadgum emotes on my comments
no flags from what i could see
my favorite part is putting goofy comments in my code
honestly Stardew Valley being developed by one guy really shows in the code, it's kinda fun to look at
wouldn't know. maybe theres flags on the pills themselves in pocketitems.xml
so maybe just pill pools?
I'm talking about editing PHD so that it doesn't let you get shitty pills
i think the fact Stardew is solo dev'd could be a factor
<@131576903722074112> sounds like prism
Aight cya bob
Im not going to sleep im just leaving
a good API for Stardew Valley could've come out ages ago if they were willing to do what tAPI did rather than mess with all this injection stuff
honestly I've been thinking of making a BoI semi-clone (and giving it a 3DS homebrew version)
you cant edit them with _lua_ but theres' probably some way of messing with them
night!
like ok
anyway I gt c ya
i'm talkin bout items in afterbirth +
maybe u could try asking the Antibirth devs?
not even the AB+ ones are in lua
im p sure
you can't edit existing items??????
wait are you serioius
exactly
that's literally what tAPI was and tML is
uhh
there's another XNA game people are taking ages to create a modding API for (Stardew Valley) because apparently it's bad to just modify the game's source code and release it as an API
which is... really silly
i dont think you can. theyre not coded in lua apparently
i also have a question, how do you edit an existing item?
<@228680372215349249> You should try and get in contact with the tML devs, they'd probably love some tips
its playertype something
i dont mean to derail the conversation but for custom challenges does anyone know what to write to make the player start off as the lost?
Probably not
not sure if tML has a custom tile UI system like I made for tAPI
thank
?
?
college ain't easy
you're nerdy in our hearts
I think i have a good balance
i feel like i'm not committed enough to the nerdom
I mean they're constantly updating it tho
my top hours in a game is like 90 hours
nice sprites my dude
Yeah Relogic is so great
TML is missing a bunch of stuff as far as I can tell
sadly not the same can happen with binding of isaac
you could just take a game, practically the entire source code given to you already and make an API for it

Some Terraria sprited I did
really miss it being a thing...
tAPI was great
man you guys must've had it easy
eeeyup
That's so cool
Oooh really?
yo really?
I was one of the devs of tAPI
speaking of Terraria
silver 1 is a fun rank
im proud to say I have a whopping 1300 hours in CS:GO
terraria's great
And modding added even more stuff
The devs are great and the updates constantly kept the content fresh honestly
i go throgh phases
Only thing keeping me alive was yt and spriting plus a bit of gaming
yeah but still
how do you not get bored or at least fatigued
I mean I've had the game for a long time
4k????
wtf
i do not understand how people play that much
oh god I've got ~4000 hours in Terraria
Yeah it got boring fast
gotta farm those legnedaries my dude
Why not stop at 666 hours and scare people
my friend has spent like 1000 hours in gary's mod
oh
??
I just started going back to it because sitting on your butt for a year straight doing nothing but watching your life away with anime gets boring
??
hours**
i think the nerdiest thing ive done is spent 777 in bl2
but yeah I despise going to school so much, too many issues with it
Hah yeah my brother actually took up speedrunning Super Metroid about a year ago
Im going to it in like a month
oh hey, pdd/nos here
nice!!
But hey I have moved to a new school that specializes in asperger kids
lol
aspergers people tend to be the biggest nerds so in a modding community it makes sense we're common
like they could never eat so they were always tired
i knew someone with really bad anxiety and they had that in the mornings
dang
Making every morning before schhol hell
And that makes my stomach hurt real bad
I just get easily stressed out
i've never known anyone with aspergers
:c
ooh that sucks
My brother actually has Aspergers too and he's around your age too
Including it amke my stomach go into heaps of pain
even managed to show off my project at pax!
good luck with that bobernio
left school at 10th grade, went to gamedev courses
oh :/
Uhhh yeah had alot of issues with it
i couldnt finish 7th grade because i got tricho
eh doesn't matter
wait, you got OUT OF SCHOOL FOR ASPERGERS?!
i actually prefer defining variable types
lua is scary for us who can't even use the start menu properly
to those who don't it's probably a blessing to not have to define variable types and all this crap
I havent been to school for the last six months due to aspergers
Sure, there's no need to lua to mod. Only if you want to add new things.
lua is more scary and confusing to those of us who actually know how to code
i'd rather C#
?
not lua
can i just
lua is scary and confusing
good 4 u
as well as jumping through the hoops of the language
Yeah
like i think it's impressive
coding can be hard at times, but really it's just finding the right words and putting them in the right place
That's not what i mean jeez
?
yeah dude.
People tend to believe that younger people are utterly incapable of even mild competency.
Really?
wow me too
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING
AYYY ASPERGERS FIVE!
Well I do have Aspergers so that does make me smarter
I know from experience
bob learn coding now and people will call you a genius
im not a super genius
How is that crazy
it's just CRAY
i believe you lol
Who actually cares?
you don't have to
Why would anyone disbelieve that?
How do I prove this to you?
Im really 13
Im not actually joking
23. Get off my lawn!
unity's also got built in post-processing effects that can help make the game look real purty
Im just going into 8th grade
that's cray
Im not joking
you gotta keep redrawing the same character at the right proportions and junk with 2d. with 3d you rig the thing once and thats it
What I am
that's cray
<@!188945290923868161> u being 13
i should just combine graphic design and modding
<@!134108150155444224> what do you mean by Bob pls?
i'm juggling learning bartending, graphic design and this
at least in terms of animation i suppose
imo its actually harder to make 2D stuff than 3d
and I know, but that's even weirder
if I'm gonna make bad art I wanna do it on the 2D plane preferably
unity can do 2D
plus I just prefer 2D generally
pls what?
i'd recommend trying out the unity engine sometime. it can do a lot. not every game needs a custom engine
what?
bob pls
16 is pretty impressive
13
makes sense
16
17
woah
i'm 19
19
you don't have to share
How old are yall
noice\
then it became the only way I could make a game
the above gif is a project im working on, the gif was rendered in unity
I remember picking up XNA one day and thinking "what do I do with this, I can't see where I'm placing the objects"
¯\_(?)_/¯
<@113732793787351044> maybe but it overcomplicates things most of the time
hahah wow
People were pissed
i have crippling depression ?
it's easier for me to just have plain code than visuals
I feel like there'd be some satisfaction with that kind of "reinventing the wheel" sort of thing tho
Fun Fact About Tibia there is a door in the game that can only be entered by a person that is level 999 and one guy spent 9 years training upto that level and when he was livestreaming him going in the door he ended the livestream and told noone what was behind that door only he knows
why??? you dont have to completely re-invent the wheel
Why do my files keep going all lowercase?!
I want to define and render every single thing in my game using nothing more than code and file paths but unity makes that weird
you can make some neato stuff in it

_flails wildly._
it's too weird for me
I'd rather not
<@131576903722074112> the unity engine is a thing
even though that market is crazy difficult
I've been learning a whole bunch of programming languages recently cause I'm actually planning on looking into game/software design as a job
brb
that's why I stick to modding
I have tried many times
I can code anything I want but I cannot for the life of me make a game engine or an API
it was like "choose race" "choose class" and that's it
it was just making popups appear
it wasn't real code and i still can't code
i was really young too
I CANT EVEN CODE
i made a choose your own adventure game
xcode?
i "coded" in whatever the built in mac thing was
amazing
wow!!!
huh
it was some stupid buried treasure mod where if you dug out sand you could find a chest
though if you mean coding in general I was coding by age 8 cus my dad
what was the mod?
that's pretty cool
wow
idk where I put them, I think they're on a external hard drive somewhere
the humble beginnings of a man as amazing as me in the modding world stretch past the horizon, my earliest legacy being in Minecraft as I had managed to get one of my mods into the one and only yogbox pack at no older than age 11
ooo i wanna see
hahah nice
that reminds me actually I made some mods for Brawl and Melee like six months ago that I just completely forgot about
"recolor"
literally all i did was take tails' skin and change the hue

oh wow nice
waitwait i made some mods for super smash bros brawl when i was like 12
I mean i started sprite like 6 months ago
i was minecraft tho lol
hey same!
I've always been interested in modding games, but I never really did any of it (except I did some terraria modding like four years ago) until AB+ came along and I decided to jump on the bandwagon
bad**
it's not that mad
https://youtu.be/ENDQBE7RElU?list=FLvbFgsMSK1_jRQPoMcPAIuw
Its horrid to look at
aw cute
My first sprite
I just like did it
how dd y'all get into modding?
also that reminds me a lot of FFIII which is interesting
I'm pretty sure you could but I'm not sure how the scaling works
like can we do a really high resolution flash isaac mod?
what are the limits for the art in isaac modding wise?
Also its cool that its almost 20 years old
And its free which is nice
ye but u get used to it
its an interesting design choice
that camera angle is really throwing me off

shake that ass for me
yes
i wanna turn afterbirth+ into a dating sim
an idea I had
5/7, a perfect score
what's the dream area
5/7
i love it
SO GOOD
ITS A GOOD IDEA ROBO BABY
<@!134108150155444224> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feUSTS21-8
Now with more vapor
Coming Soon
Afterbirth#
you should sprite a big eeveelution fight and it could be the new final boss of afterbirth#
?
PUT IT IN THE DREAM AREA
link it
now i wanna listen to that song
NO
that could be good
dude ok
with the vapor
replace the void
2   t o   t h e   1   t o   t h e    1   t o   t h e   3
wait
Im calling the police
stop ur killing us all
vaporwave boss
no
flareon
what should I sprite now?
So uhh
the eevees
i love that
DID SOMEBODY SAY VAPORWAVE
it's a bold strategy cotton
hmm
move laptop from lap to top
*ocean man*
but i have laptop in lap
*vaporwave*
i need water
lionFlood
wow
now lets think about how when we die it wont even matter
roasted
welcome-a back mario
Welcome.
wb
imma back
ha
ha
voided it
hahaaa get it
+.25 shot speed
they wouldve overcome ab+
They would void it
they wouldnt just overlap it
I will go on to make the legend of zelda
once I can do more with sprites this API is as good as done for me
I'd rather see them work with the official game to improve it, if it has something Afterbirth+ has.
because they didn't want to overlap with afterbirth +
but they didn't release them
It already has them
Does Antibirth have its own mod tools planned?
what
yoooo that'd be sick
You know, like with the 3rd special floor, a floor splited in two, with this kind of room in crawlspace between
If the API was better we could probably change them ?
I would love to see the antibirth mod tools. I wonder if they're better than what we have
yeah
The physics are too floaty
Yeah, i wanted to make more room like that
It is
Yeah
have you seen it? it's really cool
a boss
not a mod
Antibirth has a mod like that
I mean with the current API it'd suck but if it gets to the point we were promised in the future it's possible
Sure you can. There's an item just for that.
You could do super metroid tho
you cant jump in them
yeah
I don't think it'd work out well.
By using the crawlspace kind of rooms and stuff
make a new enemy
That's actually a really cool idea tho
copy pasta smb.exe xdddd
I could make super meat boy in isaac
Replace Isaac with the purple tentacle from Day of the Tentacle.
yes
winking in unison
two eyes and 3 mouths
it's concievable
hmm
;;)))
Fingering God as new final boss
off i go
with stuff
thank you
that changes things
ok
Make a mod
any ideas for me? modding wise?
someone needs to keep the peace
thanks

what is sound ghost
aw
well I tried to make a sound ghost to play sounds for me but not working atm.. I'll try again later
AVERYBODY* sorry
did antibirth music mod, classic music mod, and AYEVERYBODY
I renamed item
is rename items and change textures
the most ive done
So this kind of stuff is my first time doing it
Well yeah I mean I replaced the title theme in Isaac with the Wii Shop theme at one point but I wouldn't really call that actual modding
but it opens the door, if that makes sense
which is easy
All i've done is audio replacement
it generally does swallow up your free time
modding is time consuming
;-;
I've been in multiple fairly small modding communities
the most ive done so far is make graphics for mods
like
i'm worried it's gonna swallow up my free time in college

Yeah same here
same
it's cool getting into a community like this

i've never modded a game before
no matter who you are it's morning
cya bob

it's morning

Im having dinner be back in 10 min

>2017
>sprite
are you saying that flareon was a sprite
looks like it could fit in the void
wrong sprite again?
yeah
that was cool
sorry wrong sprite again
?
2 years of developement is insane
i can't fucking believe the antibirth devs paid like 4-10k on it to release it for free
so is the axe going to be in its standalone mod
lol
yes
modding is hard
hmm

rude
robo bay disagrees
aw asesprite is cute
paint.net is actually a good alternitave for photoshop
I prefer photoshop, but I don't have it on this computer
i never liked photoshop for pixel art
paint.net
paint.net vs photoshop for pixel art
it even lets you animate
Yeah it looks real nice
i just love how aseprite looks lol
noice
but still
not that my mods are original content
nice
i'm on the front page of mods ?
I used ASEprite back when it was free but I use Paint.NET now and I find it to be much better
Cya Kyo
bye kyo
i use to use piskel now paint.net
G'night Kyo
Yeah yeah and the reflection thing with the devil form of isaac
ok bois i'm going to sleep now. releasing mods makes me tired
I'm currently using aseprite
paint.net
And that window
what do you guys use to sprite?
oh yeah
yeyeye good idea also a mirror that was seen
as seen in the final cutscene
ye
the board of drawings
Bob sprites are sprity man
7 pm
maybe add like
sh

heyo
hi
Oh hi modding buddies
eh
put a vibrator in there
oh I thought it was like 3
so
this is his imagination
but its like 1-2
yeah but like
It was mistake
Yeah i know
Remember ?
blue gapers sometimes spawn in the messy bedrooms
isaac mom take everything !
pokemon room type thing
flareon
Nothing at all
add an NES
<@113732793787351044>
no
Wait no!
stop
Maybe 2 or 3 blue gapers that spawn when you get near a bed? As reference to the AB+ trailer
a flareon plush
Always a teddy
a teddy
mabooby
maybe a table
thing
/apple
Ball
is that an apple?
Meant to post this... So what do you guys should think be in isaacs bedroom?
Unpacked resources aka the only way we use manual mods no longer works.
Fuck
... Oh shiet the sun...
Lel xD
AHAHAH
lol
WRONG IMAGE

Hum...
it seems kinda wonky
https://gfycat.com/DistinctMeanCrow

reposting this so it isnt lost in time and space + wb bob
im back
spok
s p o o k y
lol
time to make a sound playing ghost
I unsubbed from a mod that was deleted from the workshop and I can't delete it. It keeps redownloading every time I launch the game. lol
Thx Travoos
it should say in the documentation what it is for that specific callback
lol that's so dumb
It actually looks like EntityNPC is the only one that can play sounds
the 3rd argument is the ID or whatever of the object
i'll go test it, travoos
tech.5's sprite is disgusting
No answer ? :/
doesn't look like it should
?
So i've been telling people to put my music in resources unpacked to circumbent the achievement ban.. does that no longer woork
k
ill be back in 5 min gtg do somethin quickly
yeah I see that in EntityNPC
The AddCallBack 3rd argument is the Id of the concerned object, right ?
that would be good
it actually would be neat if the axe could get stuck in rocks for a bit and paralyze you
if nothing else can do it you can do something really stupid and create a dummy entity whos only purpose is to be invisible, play a sound, and get removed immediately after
Just to be sure...
I know EntityNPC has the ability to play a sound
debug console
then you can use whatever has the ability to play a sound to play the sound ID you used
I thought there was a function for it but I dont remember where
nope
Anyone know how to play sounds off hand?
good job
yo the Axe looks lit as shit
in theory it should be possible by editing sounds.xml
hmm
(the one used in stuff like the skull game)
use the woosh sound they already have
just get some really bad royalty free sfx :^)
It already kinda does that because of the blood explosion
and slicing sounds on hit
Some whooshing sounds on swing would be sweet
but maybe it could open secret rooms in wooden places like the cellar ?
Theoriticly
Can anyone do sound effects?
it will be stuck in a stump
Kinda hard to implement i guess
well
also idk if its possible
*stunk*
lol
Hey, that would be funny if the axe stay stuck in rock when you swing on it x)
yeah
Ooh yeah
The new acidic tears
axe can cut doors down right?
so
could be a synergy with another item maybe
logic
Does anyone know what the first parameter of Game():Darken() does?
I don't think it will but I was testing stuff
8)
we have ccl already
It's OP !
I didn't unlock the rest of the characters, thats why
The axe destroy rock ? O_o
so what if you wanna cheat at a single player game
it's still such a horrible idea that they disable achievements in the first place
Wait...
I don't see why it even matters
but edmund tweeted they're gonna fix that
all mods disable achievements
not now
Go into mods menu and hit tab to turn off all mods
so, is there anyway to enable back achievements after I removed certain mods that disable them?
so uh now what?
o
Oh that's really cool
Looks amazing, but yeah it looks just a tiny bit slow
The speed is based on your tears stat
you should maybe speed it up a bit tho
Wow that's looking good
just to see if it fixed the head bug and it does
kinda broken but really cool
also dont mind the tears.. I re-enabled them
just to show the "new" animation
Shitty gif
https://gfycat.com/DistinctMeanCrow
But according to the notes it also practically disabled the loading of unpacked resources in the main resources folder
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1jPiuBUAAEZ_vT.jpg:large
It claims to have fixed the stupid thing where the EntityPlayer being passed to callbacks wasn't a real EntityPlayer, so that's nice
10 minutes lol
i know it's been like
so what's the consensus on the patch
Also that's a cool idea
ty
Looks good
noice
If you have the can opener trinket you will charge forward laeving toxic farts

Tiny can of axe.
<@112975821186031616> it's folded up
you can throw it to stun/daze enemies
It could be an axe if you pretend hard enough, but I'm not thinking it's an axe.
woo
it is beans
That's a drum. Not an axe.
Looks like a can of beans

Oh
It's a brimstone that throw a lot of axe X_X
so dont worry about brimaxes
When you throw it weak brimstone spins around it like krampus
theres no brim-coin tears
Or...
I don't think brimstone and axe can be compatible :/
I can try improving the Brimaxe in a bit if you want
Brimaxe really early not really happy with it



Whoa, what is the last one ?
What would brim-axe do?
*waves fist at Zatherz*
"Some changes were made to Lua sandboxing due to safety concerns"
They all look ok some better then others







It was kinda just a quick attempt at it to be improved later
Yeah
I'll make a new gif real quick
I've changed it since
<@114848454336970752> the way it would work with spoon bender if we do add the tomahawk throw would just make the throw follow enemies
<@113732793787351044> that animation does look great, but it needs some more inbetween frames
"gameplay adjustments"
noice
http://steamcommunity.com/games/250900#announcements/detail/248095310200099228
https://gfycat.com/HarshBlankBarnowl
It's not tears tho

axe tears sound painful
(Oh and, about ludicovo...)
butt
Oh bob, how your mod work with spoon bender ? Does the axe is throw away to find the first enemy and then get back ? :D
nah you're just dead
No, he's just a fickle bot
was it like a spam warning or something
Robo-Baby killed you
what do those gun reactions mean
Psychic* ?
I have spoon bender
Im now phychic
so I'm left without the MaxFireDelay bonus from the item I picked up in the first floor as well as no Damage increase from my code in MC_POST_UPDATE
and it also didn't remember the MaxFireDelay that I had removed
it lost this damage increase
when I finished the floor
in MC_POST_UPDATE I have code that turns MaxFireDelay in to Damage
alright here's a conundrum
noice
nice
o
<@!164178433453064192>
Thats perfect
Actually
Ummmm make it drip with water?
idk if this would work

http://i.imgur.com/XGu5oNz.png what do i do to make this better? (it's a tortoise tail)
Thats the ds character reference

I haven't done much with costumes tho so maybe just start with 1 sprite and see if it works
head*
You just need to do that for hear

woh
head is pretty easy


I mean It would be harder to add the beard to the head
Not that bad actually
On all of those

how bad is it?
really
Wait
You have to draw the lumberjack shirt in like a million positions
Lag
that sent twice?
I can try
I can try
just FYI
Could somebody add ears to the sides of the were beaver form I couldnt do it well
I feel like it'd look really awkward if it was just always there in his hand
like in his hand
is isaac going to hold the item
I will work on that then
yeah
o
ooh yeah
Lumberjack shirt?
Better butter bean essentially
I might just want to completely redo it at some point tho
better bean?

I actually haven't started any coding, but I slightly improved the "Better Bean" sprite
hmmmmm
Ummmm
A sweet beard?
A scar?
What would the axe add?
every passive item adds some effect to Isaac
How the Giga Butter Bean going?
One thing you could do is make a costume for it
So uh
<:plum:259939492008296448>
?
axe first giant impossible mod later
yeah
It's getting there
sure, but right now I wanna get the axe perfect
just mashup a ton of mods made here
and as long as we use a different item it'd be fine
That defeated the room idea
It'd still be a cool idea to have in a bigger mod instead of a singular item
Well
yeah the rope ladder right?
Rope ladder I think
Oh
already*
Someone made a mod that does that alreadyu
Now we still need an item that can bring you back floors any ideas of what it could be?
¯\_(?)_/¯
i dont like the tool
make the full animation with the tool
instead of just the sprite
You can just make the animation
and 64x64 frames
with more precise speed
im gonna make a new one
leave it for now that swing animation looks sick
eh
But tomahawk is not a bad idea
Forgot
It can chop doors
can only use sprites
Oh wait
You can't render stuff
Heck, if a trail could fluidly be programmed in that'd be even better.
It needs some sort of range attack to deal with rooms that have enemies fire from afar over pits
no idea
are we gonna still make it that if you hold down the fire button you can charge it and throw it like a tomahawk?
once i save it it will be transparent
I still think it'd be best if you just had a few animations for a trail and tried to rotate the sprite with it. Would be a lot more flexible that way for speed.
thats just paint.net being paint.net
ik
also, need invisible background
Wait
its not
To make it smoother
I think maybe double the number of frames?
It shouldn't be the same speed the entire time
Ye looked like it, bob
but
180 I think
or just that
360
do you want it to go
meant to be its a reference
that might look better, but like I said, it's not a good animation sheet
~~that looks like lucy~~
N                                  O                                       I                                 C                                   E

double noice
noice

What was that April Fools thing for the 3DS? Maybe we should mod that in.
So back to dat axe
and then rip them to shreds with the axe
But im getting ahead of my self here
Also I wanna include some kid friendly bosses
It would be all stupid
Oh that'd be cool
nah I was thinking of having shoop as a mini boss in a dream level that you would access through a special be as a extra mini dungeon of sorts
nothing too interesting there
update comin
finish slowly, like it's recovering from the swing
BoI *is* trying to go for a pixel art style, adding tons of blurs all over is probably not good for it.
mid way through
so.. start off with a smaller trail and make the axe move faster with a lo9nger trail
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1jPiuBUAAEZ_vT.jpg:large
GUYS
Or maybe instead of a miniboss it could just be an enemy that only shows up in a certain secret room?
but you gotta account for the swinging momentum
I mean, that looks fine, but maybe sharper?
noice
yeah
something like this?
Would be funny bur im reserving shoop for another idea I have
Duke of Flies miniboss alt, always drops Shoop Da Whoop?
Please no.

Why would anyone ever want that?
Now we need to sneak this in somehow
i.e. motion blur

The smear simulates the fact that it moves so fast that it shows up in multiple places in a single frame
thats a smear not a blur
So ok I think thats enough combinations for now right?
Of course not, it's simulated
thats not actual blur though
So more-than-one-color?
This is what I mean by "motion blur"
http://s21.postimg.org/3xk0m6b5z/mega_Man1.png

so i use this image right
Eh, could always add *that* as an animation.
First off
I mean fire has to have a trail
oh
But then we wouldn't have the trail behind the axe
I mean in the code.
well
I'm using SwingSmooth
Here's the animation file
nowhere in isaac is blur used

I tried taht
however
Maybe you could just find a way to rotate the sprite.
yw
<@!164178433453064192> Thanks
oh ok cool
I aint the best at that anyone good at itr?
i can ig
that simulates momentum
either someone fixes it for a smoother motion blurry effect
soooo
cause it looked choppy in game
So I'm kinda using this right now, but I had to make a custom animation with different timings
use that?

Okay
?
wat <@!164178433453064192>
Made another edit to the axe blade, not completely sure about it tho
just copy tear frames
i actually specialize in pixel art graphic design rip
D:
Y MUST I ANIMATE LAST TIME I DID THAT IT DIDNT EVEN WORK
o
ye pretty bad
now you animate them all ?
is that a brimstone axe
ye
<@!188945290923868161>
So uh now what?
ye
Thank <@113732793787351044>
Pfsh.
Im not proud of brimstone but whatev
nice
yup
and do that?
save as
so i can just edit nothing
aight
ik
It'll look something like this: https://puu.sh/tdZtQ/bf3fe0af6c.png
oh right
Oh, when you save a png in paint.net or photoshop or something like that there'll be the options of bit depth
Oh probably
Probably already better than most melee weapons, in fact.
Yeah?
The thing is the range is so bad that you take a lot of damage anyway
<@!188945290923868161>
Maybe, but I think already giving it a scaling knockback is sufficient.
<@113732793787351044>
It's a confusion effect, not stun
how would i do that
<@112975821186031616> Idk, the stun doesn't do much, it's very short
Looks like you need to resave all of the pngs with 32-bit depth
I'd say it's an improvement.
in fact its the only item that works
Ah, so that's an existing item.

It looks ?
but i made it more sleek
it had transparency before
I think it looks nice, <@!164178433453064192>. Though I don't know any item pickups to have semi-transparency.
Giving it a stun as well kinda makes it seem like it's doing too much stuff, to be honest.
thoughts on tractor beam?
Actually wait I'ma try something with that sprite
Luck affects chance of stunning
Shot speed affects knockback

Damage is obvious
Tears affect swing speed and cooldown
I do use most stats tho
no, you have to recode all the synergies manually afaik
Does the axe currently respect tear effect application?
niiice
yep
Head of the Keeper?

Endershot your idea looks very good I will try it out tommorow
does anyone know how to fix ab+ crashing on startup after changing a mod
where it only swings when you release
I actually had the charge idea in mind for the basic item
Brimstone charging could be him slowly raising the axe above his head to let out a larger beam. Probably making this one item way too complex as it is.
night
G'night Ender
Brimstone + Polyphemus = 20 second axe swing
lmao
I can imagine Isaac swinging the axe like a wand, a laser beam firing out the corner of the blade.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836666550
Gn guys, not like you care. Enjoy my mod I guess
yeah
Or maybe an extended range with the laser making up the extension?
Ooh yeah
<@!188945290923868161> Tech synergy could maybe leave a line of laser in the axe's swing arch.
Isaacs Dad is shown in two of the endings

also
Its disgusting
Its just a resprite rn
I know but I need to get better at doing portraits first
don't directly copy greed
Maybe like
I'd say it fits the lore pretty well
That's actually a p cool idea
I gotchu
I mean I scrapped by Bob idea... The idea was that bob was isaacs father and the reason he looks like this is due to all the false information isaacs mother fed him about him being a giant lazy asshole
Oh yeah I was working on a tech axe
and another one that gives you pickups instead
that gives you trinkets instead
I might add another rubix cube
(But i'm lazy)
We all have ideas
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836666550
Holy shiet.. I have ideas :3
Wait... Fireplace is classic entity...
Could somebody do a tech axe for me as there alot of synergies for this item pls
The problem is, we cant add new grid entity
I think we can add floor
yaeh pretty sure its impossible at the moment but if we do get the tools to do that I would love to start a mod with that idea
I mean, it'd be hella difficult, but it'd so cool
That would be impressive, <@!188945290923868161>. But sounds very difficult.
Pretty sure you can't even add floors right now
Really? It sound pretty hard to do even especially with the tools we have now
<@!188945290923868161> YES
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836666550
wrong link
I was thinking this... With my suggestion with the item that makes you back floors if used in the basement would bring you to a secret room which was your bedroom withe useful stuff in it well what if in the room there was a window that if you broke open with bombs and such could be entered to access a new level callede the outside in which there would be a room in that level that had a stump with the axe in it and you had to get it out somehow
https://youtu.be/b2hugJj4wpY
ITS UP
(weird)
(not a grid entity)
the whole fireplace is an entity
Okay nvm
don't we all
I need to find a poop
I see
Wait, i'll check that
Angra : I think the gridentities fire create a normal entities fire on creation
Yaeh I was thinking about that
That you have to clear to unlock the axe?
There should be a forest alt floor
I have the axe logic working for breaking rocks but fires aren't affected
There should should bee an active item called "Bad Computer" which confuses all enemys and gives you the Retro Vision effect. The Description could be "But can it run Crisis?|
are fires not gridEntities??
yes
I'm ready
Now we shall die
HEHEHEHE
HAHAHAH
U DA BEST
:^)
U SO FUNNY
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
Or should I say, God-Headless?
yep
Yo is that Godhead Axe
np
Thanks again <@113732793787351044>

I'm gonna think of some mod Ideas
Test it for bugs?
You improve it ? :3
I finished my mod
what do I do now
uh
Crap :/
Not sure if you'd want it, but I tried my hand at a Death's Touch Synergy version too <@!188945290923868161>
Its uploading
Oh...
the higher number will appear on top of the lower number
stacking images on top of each other
but higher number = drawn on top
that's like
that's not vertical height
I don't know if it has a parallax effect
(If i put a really high number, it will be offscreen ?)
Th renderZoffset : The highter the number is, the highter the object will be ?
Angra just to be sure...
i made the worst video of all time
beautiful
Maybe just rotate the blade to be more stabby?
The most stupid one right here
So is it currently possible to add items without editing the base files so people don't end up with mod conflicts?
ok cool hopefuly you can do that
I'm pretty sure I can hot swap the spritesheet without having to create a new animation for it
Yeah sorry about that
need to clean up the base Axe animation spritesheet and use it as a reference to animate the different Axe sprites
np
<@113732793787351044> Thanks
The axe plus deaths touch
<@!188945290923868161> Here's an idea of The Axe + Mysterious Liquid for maybe poisoning enemies and creating creep on hit?
Editing video now
(In case it's not obvious I just planned on using them as a reference to getting started with modding. Can't tell if you're actually offended or not)
Me too. ?
thanks I really appreciate you stealing my hard work
<@266032468853915650> I'mma download your mod and steal your luas. Can't be bothered to look up tutorials to get started with it.
<@266032468853915650> I'mma download your mod and steal your luas. Can't be bothered to look up tutorials to get started with it.
anyway since this item is special and very good heaps of cool synergies
discord servers are under heavy load
Ditto. Probably Discord.
Time to record the test video
Imma lagging
gotcha
the timing
gotcha
omg

The fire mind costume
woo power flicker
Yeah I used this from fire mind

The outlining could abide BoI's standards too.
That's the flame sprite
I don't think it looks bad. Might look better with shading, though.
That's the flame sprite
Its ok..
actually too big lmao

scaled from 32x32
my sprites are shit
my sprites are shit
it looks better than my sprites
that's a good start
woag
I really suck at flames

IT IS UP BOIS
<@!120669965236830208> be my mod buddy ?
<@114848454336970752> is one of *those* guys. The ones that extend a syllable that you're not actually saying for a longer duration.
Are unlocks like that possible rn?
btw the dice mod works now
"FATALITY!"
Han :c
Call it
No
Call the achievement "Here is johnnyyyyy"
^
Unlock after beating headleass Horseman 5 times
That makes more sense actually
<@!188945290923868161> Maybe something like destroying X fire pits. Or collecting all of the wooden items in the same run (e.g. Toothpicks, Wooden Spoon, Wooden Coin).
<@!188945290923868161> maybe unlock the Axe after beating the Cage and Sisters Vis cause of the whole headless thing?
fire is an entity now
BTW, Did someone find out how to create new grid entities (Rock, pit, spike, fireplace, poop, etc...)?
Robo-Baby so savage
maybe later
not now
<@267112861921181697> It's okay then, don't need my help for the image ? x)
Edmin will deliver more docs
Laser Axe lol
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Like a fiery axe with Fire Mind or something
<@!188945290923868161> You could add synergies to the axe
there is an achievementID class
Btw thank you guys so much for helping me make this item
also Im working on taht pumpkin
hmm
it works ok now,
"Yeah"
Yaeh
oh fuck me picture is massive
like any achievement item?
What you mean
Plop. <@267112861921181697> i think i have a workaround for your pcture problem, but it's kinda dirty
Ok guys any suggestions on how the axe would be unlocked if unlockable?
Testing again
```
local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube", 1 );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10
local rng = RNG();

function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
            cubeUse = 5 + rng:RandomInt(5);

            player:AnimateHappy();

            local spawnPos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position, 1);
            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, spawnPos, Vector(0,0), player);
        else
            player:AnimateSad();
        end
end
cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, cube.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);
```
then what do I do?
I gave you a different version
Reset the count*
Why wont this reset the timer?
```local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube", 1 );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10

function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then

            player:AnimateHappy();

            local spawnPos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position, 1);

            player:AnimateSad();
        end
end
cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, cube.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);```
mispelled
nvm
Did you restart the game?
in the hotbar or?
also the cube sprite isn't showing up
I want it to give me more failures
after I get the first cube, it just keeps giving me items
maybe you can tinker with that
Portable slot makes isaac bring up the slot machine item up
NO MATTER WHAT
WHAT THE FUCK
final mod test
ok then
You'd need to do custom rendering or something
As far as I know, there's no easy way to do that right now
I have 5 differnet picutes I want to use for my active item. I want the image to change each time I use it, and to change to a another image when I finish unscrambibng the cube. How Can I do this?
With?
<@!120669965236830208> Can you help me real fast?
gonna ask again, what does QueryRoomTypeIndex() do?
what about a little pumpkin?
Wouldn't hate an Isaac-ified version of this, if you can be bothered. http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/0/0a/SC2_ProShields.gif
Lol
New rule: I aint doin logos they are boring and have like no shading required
thank you! <@132307248578953216>
alright, seems to be working!

ok
yes
in resources>rooms?
hey bob can you do a goofy overwatch logo?
alright kid now import the binary again
Dont care somebody can use them tho a couple I will keep for myself
uh
https://gyazo.com/e9f858a380afcd439aade340034996d2
yes
isaac-ng should be the executable right?
One more cube formation
the next line will auto fill
and below select the executable
<@!188945290923868161> Are you making sprites that someone(s) can use or just drawing around for yourself?
yup
alright, so i select the resources folder for the rebirth resources in room editor?
Ehhh at the moment im working on The axe idae with <@!120669965236830208> but I also ahve another idae of having a secret/room
what does QueryRoomTypeIndex() do?
eh, it kinda makes the front cover look too seperate
I based it off one of the existing book sprites, but I'll see how it looks with black on the inner outline
are you just doing random sprites?
there is already a void in the game you silly
Floating in the endless void
<@!188945290923868161> what are you doing?
I guess the inner edges of the book could be black, though.
set the resource folder that should be resources
<@113732793787351044> i think it could be a little sharper but it's nice atm
Ok what should I do now somebody give me an idea of what to sprite
on the software head to tools then settings
*I* like it.
what next?
i'm kinda lost, last thing i did was import binary to resources>rooms
but not bad
its eh
How does this book look to you guys?
100 percent accurate
here
but its faster on the software
you can do it from there
on the program itself
kid the amazing
oh
is this what you meant by settings?
no no
https://gyazo.com/777105579552d2730c1fc70aaf940e93
That too.

why is it a gif lol
Is it supposed to only have the one face?
I have a rubix cube right next to me lol
We need an expert to verify the accuracy of it.
noice
cube*
my xubw

has anyone gotten the itempools to work?
and next you want to set the rebirth executable that should be isaac-ng.exe
not resources.jp or .kr
browse to the resources folder
and on rebirth resources
head to Tools, then settings
oh forgot one thing

i did everything you said, still getting the error
Ill try I guess
and idk <@267112861921181697>
yeah
so i select the rooms folder?
Can item images be bigger than 32x32
ok got it
YES FINALLY COMPLETED THE BASE EXPANSION
head to file and hit Import Binary
open the roomeditor tool
yeah
also, how do i import binary? and what do i do it to?
so this folder? https://gyazo.com/cec8f6a90e5eca1fca50d8796467f619

then on the next message that pops up hit yes
when you select that folder hit ok
<@219284479275958272> Head to file, then import binary, make sure you select the folder \The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\rooms
then let's get to studying!
<@116386733905412105> it's possible
i saw a settings thing in the roomeditor folder
that lets you select the folder I think
no there's like a settings or config or something in the roomeditor
I want like 5 scrambled forms that it switches between as it fails
and then mine said it couldn't find all of the pre-built rooms but I didn't need them so I didn't bother finding them
so just copy it to the resource files?
<@!120669965236830208> hey, is it possible for me to change the sprite of the active item? Like randomly change colours until I complete it?
I think you just point it to your resources files
oh
why are you importing a binary
i'm trying to get the roomeditor to work
so, i extracted resources, and apparently i'm supposed to import binary. How do I do this?
you'll figure it out if I make you smart?
so you're telling me
Well I'm dumb so no where really
I know, I can try though.
that's what you probably should have done to begin with tbh >_>
telling people to shut up on the internet rarely works
<:plum:259939492008296448>
<@165644528424845313> how far have you gotten?
**wink**
Blocked Jack lmao
What
no that's shareware
I'm trying to figure out Tear Params too
oh i thought malware was a nice program for your computer to make it look pretty
and you wouldn't even notice
Jack, shut the fuck up. I have enough anxiety on my own, you don't need to contribute to that.
then that payload could also steal your account
one could simply execute a payload that rates up the downloaded malicious mod from the workshop, as well as favoriting it, to make it more visible
does anybody know how to use Tear Params
okay, let me put things into perspective
more importantly
yeah not sure why this is even a point of conflict
there are tons of other ways to execute code
¯\_(?)_/¯
it's not just loadlib
I know that this isn't the safest workshop by all means, I already contacted Nicalis about it
so you know that software is grossly vulnerable but still use it...
You are, however, being an ass.
I am not retarded.
thanks for the heads up Jack ?
really?
...?
your being annoying about something we already know about
Chill guys
i'm being annoying because I'm warning you of glaring security issues?
can someone shut Jack up? he is being annoying
it just goes to show that there was absolutely no thought put into security
and loadlib is one of the most basic things that Nicalis could've easily removed
No idea, not documented
if you download that mod from the workshop, it executes code
I need me some seed stuff working correctly
That's the general attitude of online users, I'm afraid.
I'm not using workshop anyway
case in point: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834354236
<@132307248578953216> What about setseed???
<@267112861921181697> really? you should
i dont care
kk
someone could easily make a "trojan-horse" type mod that functions but also infects users
oh yeah, i heard that exes were allowed on the workshop
hmm yeah what exactly setseed does
an executable payload is only a few hundred bytes...
Ill only be downloading popular mods
it's because nicalis didn't implement any of their mod loading or API with security in mind
its not like Ill just be downloading random mods
no
so is every game that uses workshop
_any_ mod on the workshop could be riddled with malware that would fuck you over
because afterbirth+ is a security nightmare
Whys that
hey guys, nobody should be downloading mods from the workshop
there's a SetSeed function
I thought RNG used the level seed but I'm not sure if it does
rng is a certain number while math.random is a number between 1 and 0
<@266032468853915650> Thanks! It still doesn't quite work the way I'd like unfortunately lol
whats the difference between rng and math.random?
thanks

<@132307248578953216> Please how do I choose a random number between 5 and 10
your code is messed up
But when I move it to resources/scripts it just stops working
<@!120669965236830208> How do I choose a random number between 5 and 10?
If I put it in the root directory it sometimes says [Old]
<@267156751936126977> root
where is import binary?
how do I choose a random number between 10 and 5?
Which is the right place to put main.lua, in the root directory or in resources/scripts?
I think I changed it to 1 while testing
^
Ender, just change the number back to 10
if so then hit Ok
is it rooms?
if you clicked on import binary check the folder location
so this question might be out of my league but is there a way to use a EffectVariant to change what kind of tear you shoot
o no
folder called room? i don't see a folder called room, where should it be?
you gotta reset the value at the end
after ten times you can have any item...
it doesn't reset the counter...
oh no
oh
is there any way to detect explosions?
and confirm the action
you just hit ok
it should be already on the folder called room
just head to file then import binary
IT FUCKING WORKS
<@132307248578953216> so how do I import the binaries? kind of new to modding, sorry if this is a stupid question
and player.position instead of player.Position
amazing
Yeah nil works
cubeuse instead of cubeUse
so would nil work too?
o
It was just bad capitalization
That wasn't the problem
instead of player
oh the entity spawner was nil
There

<@131576903722074112> help
yeah but its pretty easy to get jera + blank card, then again breaking runs like that isn't too hard
thirty rooms for 1 item
three charges
every ten
seems a bit powerfull doesn't it?
```<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <active description="The old enigma, is it even possible to solve?" gfx="Collectibles_Cube.png" maxcharges="3" name="Puzzle Cube" />
</items>
```
Supposed to give an item every ten uses
so what is it supposed to do? i really don't understand anything about coding so i don't get what's happening
The item spawn code might need a specific sub type
I'll test it
Can you paste your items file too?
I pressed it like thirty times and nothiung
I got the item ok, And I tried to use it but nothing happens.
what's going on ender describe
```local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube", 1 );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10

function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
            cubeuse = cubeuse+10
            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, player.position, Vector(0,0), nil);
        end
end
cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, cube.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);```
Can you send me your mod?
Ender, what's your code now?
can't you just spawn batteries?
NOTHING IS HAPPENINGGGGGGGG
thanks guys
dammit
but I did it in render
OH wait yeah float val
I would assume anywhere
In render
tint uses float value
Or just anywhere?
In render? or update?
works for me
```
player.Color = Color(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1);
```
debug 8
Whats the command to give my item infinite charges
Brb
<@!120669965236830208> I've been trying with `Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Color:SetTint(255, 0, 0, 100)`, and I've tried in both the render and update callbacks
my console key is `
nah, spawning rocks
Spawn a pessure plate?
Has anyone gotten Isaac.GridSpawn or room:GridSpawn to work?
<@267065025024229377> I'll give it a shot, gimme a min
in spanish keyboards that is
well its usually the one left of 1 or the one to the right of L
<@!120669965236830208>  Yeah I've been trying entity.Color, no luck
i've pressed my entire keyboard none work :c
<@267065025024229377> player.Color(Color(1,0,0,1,0,0,0))
-or
<@267065025024229377> Costumes or I'm guessing entity.Color
yes thats the ñ
The key next to L is the key for Spanish keyboards
we do have the ° and ñ keys that are usually used as the console keys in... everything mostly
... uh?
On spanish keyboards there is no key at all
nope
Or is that not something I can do?
sometimes it's Ñ in spanish keyboards
What's the intended way to make isaac be shaded a certain color?
<@267112861921181697> keep pressing buttons until you get one, mine was " for some reason
the one next to 1
By the way what causes the old marking for anyone who doesn't know is when your mod errors at all
left of 1
backtick/tilde key
that key
^
How do i open the console
Alright endershot, you gotta find what causes it so you can learn
Sure, the number doesn't matter, but you need one
.Position is still nota captalised
The first patch after release made it so you need the number
how do I open the console
it doesn't matter what number you put there
ITS NOT OLD ANYMORE
Have you tried it since the update?
that's odd one mod i have works without it
Yes, 1 is required
ill check the api
RegisterMod("ModName",1)
the 1 is not always required is it?
okay
<@193389830690963457> The creep is probably just an entity. Figure out what entity it is and spawn it on you every frame
Oh yea and put ,1 on registermod
This is so much bullshit for a rubix cube
```local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube" );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10

function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
            cubeuse = cubeuse+10
            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, player.position, Vector(0,0), nil);
        end
end
cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, cube.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);```
avoids the "old" thing
try `local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( 0 )`
to reload your lua files without restarting the game
how do i make an item leave a small trail behind me, like aquarius or anemia?
Pro tip: use "luamod"  command
Delete update.it again?
STILL FUCKING OLD
I'm dumb so I'm glad I could help ?
.Position yeah
<@165644528424845313> Thank you!
just copy that?
Player.Position is captalised
`local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube" );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )

            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, Player.position, Vector(0,0), nil);
        end
end

From player var
Re.ove .positioon
i forgot how to markdown
spawn 5.100.itemid I think it was
local    cubeUse = 10
function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
local    Player = Isaac.GetPlayer.position(0)
I'm trying to make a gif of my mod
Just, using the console
Anyone know how to spawn an item pedestal?
in what way
Position is captalised
better?
after function
```local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube" );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10
local    Player = Isaac.GetPlayer.position(0)
function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
            cubeuse = cubeuse+10
            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, Player.position, Vector(0,0), nil);
        end
end
cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, cube.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);```
cause every entity depends on that
^ protip
Always define the position
Player.Position*
local Player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
Player.position
haha...
how does one do that
no
Havê you defined yourPosition?
yeah i don't understand anything about coding so i'll just stick to spriting <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>

ol'e mod
show code again
I DELETED UPDATE.IT DAMN IT
its just natural
and trust me physilver when you know how to sprite it seems way simpler
It says my mod is old
WHY
doesn't have to be perfect
well don't call it copying, its... "creative alterations"
its not hard, just picture what you want and do a quick sketch
TEST TIME
oh

for my kindred spirits mod I literally copied the dip
sprite what?
why is that?
I'm way too lazy to ever sprite
ez solve
Just rearrange the stickers
so ?
and much sprites
and ez to make
the IDea is good
I haz idea
The old Enigma, Is it even possible to solve?
I need to boost my mind
lol
Enigma
The Old Enima
?
fuffles
oo
"the new enigma"
I like Essej rn
Break your head!
"Is this even possible to solve?"
"it wont work you idiot"
also should I change my pfp so I look more masculine
Puzzle it?
What should the Puzzle cube desc be
Hey
Hey guys looking for whatever makes store credit work, can't really find much on the docs
<@216324079504982016> die plx
what a traitor
no, he loves MY BUTT
he just didnt admit it yet
butt
and Robo baby loves my Peach Butt
Well, some exceptioon
oh common ender, i just pity you
but will it hate me?
and I have been here an hour
I dont
everyone hates me
Indeed
Same
Nice effect
I feel like robo-baby hates you EnderShot
and happy when the pedestal appears
just like slot machine
yeah
it will make the player sad when nothing spawns
hah
Would that work?
^ that's great
it will add a kewl effect
you shouldnt delete it if you uploaded the mod to the workshop
?
use this instead
just checking for saftly
```LUA
function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
        cubeUse = cubeUse - 1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
                cubeuse == cubeuse + 10
                player:AnimateHappy();
                Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, yourPosition, Vector(0,0), nil);
        else
                player:AnimateSad();
        end
end```
yup it's just for the user id
You can trust me
ok good.
There, I'm an angel statue now
it generates automatically anyways
I dont want it
<@131576903722074112> is it safe to delete the metadata file
can I delete the metadata folder
I changed it
but k
shouldnt hothead.use_puzzlecube be different?
there is another mistake
other than that, it should be testable at least
oh thanks
You're missing an "end"  to finish the function
what
can you do something for me Ender?
lol
but meh
to make kewl effects
Angra can you please get a pfp its hard to trust someone without a face to recognize them with
I would do some mumbo jumbo
mhm
Would this work?
and I mean the Star Sign
```local    cube = RegisterMod( "Puzzle Cube" );
local    puzzlecube = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Puzzle Cube" )
local    cubeUse = 10
function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse == 0 then
            cubeuse == cubeuse + 10
            Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, yourPosition, Vector(0,0), nil);
        end

cube:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_puzzlecube, puzzlecube);```
510?
basically like cancer
I've never tried it but if you need to specify the item, just do a random ID between 1 and whatever
after hit
a shield thinggy
hmm this should be easier to do
thats only the pedestal
try that Ender
```
Isaac.Spawn(5, 100, 0, yourPosition, Vector(0,0), nil);
```
and the item itself would work like Tough Love - Tooth Shot
o
no clue
<@131576903722074112> how do i spawn an item pedistal
basically make a new Tear which on hit/destruction bursts into 7 rainbow tears
I'm personally not touching special tears until EntityTear is added to the API
How Do i spawn a treasure room pedistal
I might be able to help
What are you trying to do with them Fuffles?
Thanks Angra
why do I have complicated stuff only
= is assign
not =
i want to die
also ==
i spelled the typo wrong
other than the "Tehn" mispelling
maybe
would that work?
```function cube:use_puzzlecube( )
    cubeUse = cubeUse-1
        if cubeUse = 0 them
            --spawn pedistal--```
add a new Tear Type and make it work kinda like Tooth Shot
Fuffles
What are you trying to do?
I need to start with something easier
sure
yeah
?
```cubeUse = cubeUse-1```
yep
and then LUA doesn't have some C# goodies (I don't think) so you gotta use unscramble = unscramble - 1
this is a bit more complicated
ugghh
id say so
local cubeUses = 10 or whatever
would that worl?
local unscramble = 10?
outside of the function, around where you'd put RegisterMod
local STUFF = 0
how do I do variables in this
but how do I access it
I found TearVariant
sure
yeah that
okay
not a loop
I think what you want is a variable that decreases or increases when you use the item
loop*
i* look
when it hits zero it spawns a pedestal and resets the timer to 5
where is TearType when you need it T~T
it counts down once per use
A loop counting down to zero
if you want to make a loop
what? Fuffles just posted something that might help you a lot
I vaguely remember how to do it in c#
Robo Baby approved
My Peachy Butt is beloved here, lol
<@131576903722074112>  how do I make an i loop in Lua
I need to get into the chars code and his Tear Shot thinggy
sigh
not change their type
ya
this would do something **on** the tears
If Im not mistaken
how do I do an i loop thing in lua
```LUA
if player:HasCollectible(prism_item) == true then
        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                 
            end
        end
    end```
yeah!
or am I overthinking this
Im doing this wrong
wait
uhh
yeah boi
butt
Robot Baby likes my peachy butt too much
awe, robo only did it wants
I wish I had 2 soups
Soup
soon
jus tsoon
s o o n . . .
Rip Ender
soon?
someone type soon
rip
Robo wants you to gun urself
soon
OMFG
soon
thanks Angra
<@131576903722074112> I am gonna need your help
Working on the cube
okay got the loop to work
<@267065025024229377> Oh yeah, that should be totally doable then
<@!120669965236830208> He's not sure how he's gonna get the item to actually *execute* the effects of the item but hey, baby steps lol
<@109624258317033472> thanks
```                                                     code here```
<@!120669965236830208> Friend has a neat idea for an active item that just behaves as the last active item you saw on a pedestal
We need a !code command to tell newbies how to do it
```code here```
<@267065025024229377>  No problem. What are you trying to do with it, if you don't mind me asking?
<@193389830690963457> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836249223
How's that sprite?
Yeah.
ah ok
I mean as in custom  bosses
its really more xml and anm2 stuff than code, i suggest you to download a fam mod <@193389830690963457>
Thanks!
Oh wow, that's SO much easier than what I was trying
it's my first boss sprite
Boss modding is possible rn I thnk
*internal pain*
if Tears are Entities I need to make a new Entity
I am going to TRY to make the cube
Hey guys, I made a sprite for a boss I might make when boss modding is possible. Lemme know what you think http://i.imgur.com/lEe13rm.png
~ isn't opening the dev console
```
function mod:DisplayEntityNames()
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    
    for i = 1, #entities do
      local e = entities[i]
      if (e.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and e.Variant == 100) then
        local itemId = e.SubType;
        -- Do whatever here
      end
    end
end
```
ugh
can i see the code
i have a familiar mod on the workshop, its not too hard
some have

```
code here
```
have people figured out familiars yet, is that difficult
three times
Click the button below escape
thanks!
rather medium
three `
Yeah I was just gonna say that haha
I'll just pastebin it
easy
questionable, I'm not sure how the item pools work
How do you format code in here?
its not hard
it is
Is it possible to code?
wasnt that rather c#
it sounds great
<@267065025024229377> Yeah I have the code for that specifically
something like that
I = 1, I ++, I > 10
sounds awesome, hard to code
I never was good at it
<@131576903722074112> Puzzle Cube (Rubix Cube) Active item, 3 charge. Treasure room pool. Every use of the item "unscrambles" it by one step. Every 5- 10 steps, it gives you a treasure room pedestal. Using it once more will reset the scramble and repeat the process. Every six unscrambles gives you a Devil Deal item, and there is a rare chance that one unscramble will be required for an item. Is this a good idea, and is it possible and relatively easy to code?
how did this thing go
for i loop
I basically want to loop over all entities (which I've got), detect which are item pedestals, and from those, get what items are on them.
how was this endless loop method thinggyy going again...
to kill and entity you use Kill or Die?
ugh
okay got it
Depending on what you mean
Yeah Kirk
Shouldn't be too hard to code
Anyone have a method of detecting what item pedestals are in the room?
That Rubix cube idea sounds pretty cool
I need to gaze upon the guy the name I dont remember and see the tear code again
:p
ok ill finialize the idea and see if its possible
spawn 5.100 is item pedestal
and i was missing a quotation mark fml
ok
ez
I would need to spawn a pedestal from a treasure room
I have a basic imagination how to do it
not rly ender
so now my stupid brain, use your magical thinking via C# and create me the tear effect me wants
now that would be tough to code though
Use it again and it re-scrambles
after 5 to 10 uses, it gives you an item!
time to work on the effect
every time you use it, it gets closer to completion
noice
okay, got them stats to work
or Puzzle Cube for copyright reason
Rubix cube
well my isaac has decided to runtime error every launch...
Im bad at ideas lol
im jealous
good thing I'm decent at ideas
<@266706294306635776>  thanks, didnt know that function worked
Now I need to find a better idea to make that would be easier to code
rip
sadly I'm not really the guy to ask for help because I really don't
if I had the mental ability to explain things I totally would
hmm there must be an easier and more organised way to handle stats
if (Tear):Distance((Enemy).Position) <= 14 then
so that is conntected to the tears instead of the player and it interacts with enemies
<@109624258317033472>  I've been using Isaac.DebugString("This string is in the log file")
interesting, shotspeed is shotspeed
How do I edit that to make it
<@131576903722074112> Those little damage pickups look sweet, gj
probably pixels
literally no clue
pixels or some other unit
the distance`?
I dunno, big enough
what is the 14?
for now Im searching what is shotspeed in cache
vector distances aren't that hard
```
if npc.Position:Distance(player.Position) <= 14 then
```
example from my kindred spirits mod
Issac.RenderText
there is no console
another question, how do i ```print``` stuff with lua?
maybe I should start simpler...
but I never heared about distances
vectors are easy
I'm fucked
then I am not ever going to be able to mod
best way to do that would be to use vector distance
It could be an unkillable entity that is attached to the tear and dies when the tear dies
<@109624258317033472>  okay thanks anyway. It's frustrating because I want my results to be seed consistent, but also not the same across different seeds lol
xD
<@131576903722074112> Is it possible to create an invisible circle and if something goes inside that circle an effect is applied?
which sounds very wrong, in hindsight
I got Apollyon to start with puberty hair
So, a character can start with multiple costumes by setting it properly in players.xml
but its nothing I wanna touchy for now
<@266706294306635776>  Btw, i think soneone messed with RNG, maybe transit. personally i have no clue ^^
<@109624258317033472> no idea sorry
you can do kewl stuff in config
I have not personally been able to find the right RNG variable to utilize
uuu
lol
<@131576903722074112> Thank you!
<@266706294306635776> Hello
cant you make an invisible circle and if something collides that invis circle effects are applied
also <@266706294306635776>, mr. invisible man
Would love if even one person acknowledged they can read these messages
does any of you know how to dump userdata in lua?
to make an aura
I just want
that's ab+ for you!
hmm is there a Cache Flag list
nothing done
I got like
Maybe I'm muted
This is my first time asking an I have been here for an hour
I could make some code for you to do something like what you wanted butt my laziness is a curse
How to butt in on a conversation
This is the worst part about asking for help on here lol
butt
what triggers robobaby
I dont know how to do that lmao
I distracted it
thanks anyway
butt
RoboBaby is still going
thanks anyway
I dont know how to do that lmao
how can you throw everything away and replace it with local and function
fuck
Anyone played with RNG()?
you could use the update callback to loop through all friendly tears, and with each tear loop through all enemies to see if any of them are within a certain distance of the tear
Lua is just confuzzling for me
ty
or Y
Vector.X
is there a way to get the values inside Vectors?
if that works, i swear to god
but yeah EnderShot, to explain it in a way that's as lazy as I am
xD you don't declare types
RoboBaby is back!
did you emote yourself?
oh
types
declare
dont
you
xD
well
oh
xD you dont declare types
local thingy = false
I edited an active item
how do you declare a bool in lua?
oh sorry
uhh this is the stupidest thing I will ask for
or does it?
ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM doesnt trigger for passive items as faras i know
to be quite honest I've never messed with something like that before
```local    darkforce = RegisterMod( "Dark Forces" );
local    darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )

 function darkforce:my_update()
    if not have_darkforce_item then

This is what I have currently
the aura is invisible if that means anything
I want to make an item, that when picked up, makes it so that every so often your tears will inflict fear and slow in a small-ish "aura" around the tear. about twice the size of the tear.
yeah
should I explain?
I dunno, maybe
can you help me with something that's probably simple to you
hey um
wow amazing
if you just want the code here https://hastebin.com/yalenupozi.lua
as someone with 3-4 days of experience only in lua I'd love to see how you made that
still cool ^^
that's pretty cool
and please help me
<@131576903722074112> whats the code behind that
what do those do
nah they're just entities
<@131576903722074112> are those custom Pickupss?
any ideas?
(the game seed)
but I get the same sequence regardless of the seed
I'm calling RNG():RandomInt()
this is probably the best thing I'll ever make with this API https://youtu.be/WVFC-iCu0pk
Anyone played with RNG in their mods yet?
bah I give up on trying to make saving work
Hey all
sprite for item is going ok
I suppose EntityTear isnt something that exists
has anybody released code for a tear modifying passive item?  No dev examples of something like that and I'm too dumb to know where to start.
I wonder how far you can go with GUI. Maybe someone could make something NEI-like for the game.
some workshop posts have pictures of items on pedestals but i assume thats spamming the d6
I can't find a command but it would be nice to see the name of the item
i'm not sure myself
as for the item pedestals
i understand your inner desire and need for butt but take it to <#207259602969034753>
so, umm
indeed it did
this modding thread went into full shitpost mode
haha
the one that you can give yourself items with
HA
Genuine question here, can you spawn item pedestals in the mod menu thing
peachy butt is best butt
very butt
correct
peachy butt
consbreastution of the united states
Robobay does not approve
sure
butt
Hm. Can BoI do semi-transparency?
cool huh? Buttastic
woot that works
butt
butt
tyty
gl modding, tell me about all the cool secrets when I come back
wow
<@122924009527574530> have a great flight! and good night ^^
yes
butt
now
he is
later guys
well, airplane
robobaby isn't your butt servant
rip
now Robo Baby died
this peachy butt is the best bootie
I think its once per person
Buttholemeeme
butt butt and shield butt
chiabutta
lol no
Isaac
I just learned that now
astonishing
youre right
OH MY GOD
clbuttic mistake
butt
peaches*
Saying butt makes robobaby give you peachs
always repeach
yess
now Im a candle
butt
are we able to use custom assets for tears yet either
I have no questions
RoboBaby thinks youre a peach, <@146600389779783680>
time to move my lazy butt and do stuff
oki
atleast i have not found it
its nowhere in the docs
Level:GetRoomById returns a fucking RoomDescriptor. what even IS that?
it would be amazing if they allow us to check on the current items
(Room descriptor
Only thing even available is the Room Editor, and it's unusable.
I think its for the devs more than anything
Linux doesn't seem to have any working mod tools whatsoever.
We need better Docs yeah, its a pain having to search around
any of you guys knows what a RoomDescriptor is?
haha
ish
because at the moment the only easy thing to use is the room editor
so maybe they can make things clearer
I think so
Yes, they will add more stuff
because they made an update a day or two ago
are the devs going to continue to add new features that we can pull from?
better safe than sorry, eh?>
just checking
same
afterbirth+
the normal size is 32x32 pixels on rebirth
ah, what a shame
<@267112861921181697> im not good at lua modding ?
If Cricket's Head is just a re-textured Max's Head, it should be pretty easy to change it.
pixels
Whats the normal size for an item?
I figured, I was just checking.
Changing the assets probably doesn't take lua.
<@174193097285173250> are you any decent at lua modding? if so I would like to ask a question
is there a mod that changes cricket's head into Max's head
I was wondering if it were viable/possible to mod in the original assets from the API.
Should I scroll back a few days for context on that or?
<@!159492166542950401> yes i worked on reflash. its kinda finished ? it displays 100% of all vanilla isaac content in in flash optic ?
you could get the tears hitting and then spawn new tear entities
pls pls pls
I'm dying pls
not rly
can I rip parts from it?
I can do that
and u got parasite
you can add the Collectible effect
I mean
hmm
is that something I'd have to rewrite from scratch
Im dumb
oh right
makes your shots split perpendicular from where they were fired
Split shot?
~~what does the parasite do~~
that issue is that I cant write code, but I can understand it well enough.
its easy to understand
Have some dignity.
Jeez, <@116386733905412105>. Put some code blocks around that thing.
for parasites effect
what would I even seach for in the API docs
hurting me
this code is
o.o
aka a normal ter that has an effect
if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                    entities[i].Variant = 33
                    local sprite = entities[i]:GetSprite()
                    sprite:Load("gfx/002.033_rock tear.anm2", true)
                    local frame = "RegularTear" .. math.min(math.max(math.floor(entities[i].CollisionDamage), 1), 13)
                    sprite:SetFrame(frame, 1)
                end
I want to add a Dark Force Tear
I just need something similar to Tooth Shot atm
Currently the best source is browsing the API Docs and seeing how other mods did things, afaik.
o.o
it's super hacky and round-about
stuff like that
I just added a new tear type
that apparently nobody anywhere knows how to use
i wanted to know about how parasite was coded
I wish I knew how to add a new Tear Type
just tear params things
right that's tear color
like number one makes your tears yellow
yeah that
he means code for the items effect
damn
oh. no.
thats not what he meant
not the lua
thats just the xml
then go to items.xml
there's a tool in your steam install folder to unpack the game's resources
nope
is there a way for me to see the item code for items already in the game?
yea
If only they built the game around the API and not the other way around.
mhm
But EnderShot. This *is* the reddit.
maybe they can help lol
ill ask the reddit
I haven't even started modding yet, so /shrug
but I couldn't figure out how to use it so
ugh I wish I knew how to do the effect I want
the TearParams class also has tear variant I believe
The TearParams class has TearScale.
which I just tested and did in fact increase when I gave myself cricket's head
that's pretty cool
<@146600389779783680> right but each tear entity has its own collisiondamage value

I only made anims/pics for it
just checking
I dont even have my 1st item rdy
kk
me no lua genius
dud
I need to make it so in a radius of an Isaac tear, monsters get inflicted with fear and potentially another effect.
with
Fuffles can you help?
FLAG_FEAR
which was obvious
wouldnt Collision dmg be like an enemy bumping into isaac
I found the fear flag
for tear damage
Entity.CollisionDamage might be what I'm looking for
hmmmm
so how do I see the scale code?
double click ease
I associated it with anm2 files
yeah that thing
that's what the animation editor is for
OH
steam->steamapps->common->the binding of isaac: w.e.->mods or tools or something like that
there is an .exe in your binding of isaac install folder
also how do I open amm2 files
The latter still applies.
The thing is I cant explore the APi because the documentation is terrible
If you want to be a programmer/modder, having general knowledge of how to browse the API is important. If you ask people how to make it do *everything*, it's hardly your mod. Might as well just browse mods that do similar to what you want and see how they do it.
take a look at tearhalo.anm2
I'm retarded
TEAR_SCALE = (sprite shit scale)?
uh
check the tear scale and replicate to the aura
How will I scale the circle along with the tear size?
Wait
kk
<@267112861921181697> yes, it is double pixel, because its better to scale
which I think is 16 px
so just compare to basic tear size
well it will scale your  circle for you too
normally?
<@109624258317033472> figured.
it scales depending on your window settings
<@116386733905412105> man, i dont know. sorry. Its probably the best to wait for another API update. it might get added until then
like terraria?
oh is this game double pixle
basic tears are what, 16px wide?
trudat
Balance is up to you, man.
pixels*
pize
how big should my circle be?
but it was be simplest if I could just set the tear variant
I mean worst-case scenario I can just read player.Damage
do you still have the code?
no. just dug into the docs, never tried myself
because I tried using that and was unable to get anywhere last night
do you have an example of GetTearHitParams
<@116386733905412105> its not perfect. And wont work if different Tears hae different damage. But it mostly will
well, function
because you totally can, there is a SetBrokenStopWatch method
its all about trial and error
maybe it would be better just to apply stopwatch effect when you aren't moving
<@267112861921181697> no one knows, documentation is shit
dug a bit into the docs
oh cool, didnt see that before
take a look at EntityPlayer:GetTearHitParams
<@109624258317033472> just the player ones; enemy tears are ENTITY_PROJECTILES anyway
<@116386733905412105> do you need the damage of every tear or just the player ones?
I don't know shit about coding that kind of things
I don't know, I haven't done it before.
and then a function in your update that applies the feared status flag to enemies within a certain distance of your tears
How would I do that?
and then an effect that attaches your image of a circle to your tears
should be easy enough
with a bitdepth of 32
well you need an image of a circle
to have a circle around a tear in which a fear effect is inflicted?
how do I change this BS
but it's not an exposed class
or w.e.
right, that's id 2 for the EntityType enum
There's an ENTITY_TEAR.
I dunno what to do
dunno if that is possible, <@116386733905412105>
in the best-case scenario, I would be able to just set the tear's tear variant and be done with it
ugh
3.14x5sqaured
I'm trying to get how much damage the tear will deal
Can you check coin counter?
and you can treat em as entitties
y. atleast the class is not exposed in the API
so tears are just Entity?
if you use Hanzo you have a small penis
a familiar is EntityFamiliar, inheriting from Entity
yes you are. Hanzo is cancer
well the player is EntityPlayer, inheriting from Entity
I'm a retard
from Poopflies over text over tears to the player
sorry
HANZO IS A CLASS
almost everything is an entitx class
are they the Entity class?
are what class
you are correct
that have na ID of 2
sorry
LengthSquared
its an ID
right, but entities
<@116386733905412105> ENTITY_TEARS is no class
Where's the shitty documentation link
does anybody know anything about what class ENTITY_TEARS are
was trying to write a script that reads all stuff from an room xml file, and outputs it to luaCode which spawn exactly thoses entities.But all id and variants dopnt match up
but velocity is a vector
could I create a invisible field that effects something colliding with it?
you would have to get the position of both then compare distance between them
who thought it would be a good idea to make the entity IDs different in the API than how they are handled by rooms HNGNGNGNGNG
how would I make it detect the enimies in a radius of the aura?
the player's current velocity squared
exactly what it sounds like
<@213504838103859200> what is velocitySquared?
to the entities
And tell it to do something
kk ^^
I know its not done yet
you need to end all of the if statements
There's an edit button, <@267112861921181697>.
My current problem is using the api and syntax, I basically do pseudo code and try to puzzle it out :/
huh
that code won't function as it is
"aura"
now I need to figure out how to make an aura
ANYWAY
sorry making minor changes
the spam is real
```local    darkfroce = RegisterMod( "Dark Forces" );
local    darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )

 function darkforce:my_update()
    if not have_darkforce_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )
        if player:HasCollectible(darkforce_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                
                
darkforce:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );```
darkfroce
```local    darkfroce = RegisterMod( "Dark Forces" );
local    darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )

 function darkforce:my_update()
    if not have_darkforce_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )
        if player:HasCollectible(darkforce_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                
                
hothead:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );```
I could just change the if statement "if velocitySquared<0.1 and no tears in room" then addfreeze
```local    hothead = RegisterMod( "Dark Forces" );
local    pyrokinesis_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )

 function darkforce:my_update()
    if not have_darkforce_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local darkforce_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )
        if player:HasCollectible(darkforce_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
                
                
hothead:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );```
just Entity class
this is my code so far
are tear entities
Check for tear entities in the room, and allow monsters to move then
Not really sure how that works. Guess it'll just take testing.
It's like the lost contact
oh neat
I am just using the addfreeze function
<@213504838103859200> Does the enemy need to re-accelerate after they stop? If so, making it apply only when there is no input could be really OP.
wish you could freeze their shots too
that could work
just make monsters move when you shoot
Despawn the tears?
<@213504838103859200> its as SUPERHOT-like mod?
which is how it is now
if you coulkd
because then it would be super op
I also can't figure out how to keep the player from shooting while you aren't moving
Superhot-esque
<@213504838103859200> Do you have the code, are you gonna upload it? It sounds pretty fun
<@267112861921181697> subscribe to the mod on steam workshop
not sure how else to use it
but I do not like using velocity because it takes a sec for your character to slow down
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive cache="speed" description="Waits and listens" gfx="Collectibles_511_Earthbending.png" id="511" name="Earthbending" />
</items>
I made something that freezes enemies when you aren't moving
for registering and shit
does anyone have the Hothead code I could use real fast
Honeslty this is the simplist thing my mind can think of
<@267112861921181697> try to make a simple one first
pls*
pld
I just want to make an item
and to be honest this api is garbage, it's not a good place to learn
I have no fucking clue what I am doing
I need help really
yeah
and then I have a variable have_darkforce_item set to false, and darkforce_item is GetItemIdByName("item_name_that_you_registered")
other than the local toph_item I just noiced
have_darkforce_item is a variable
for now, it's in the game code on dev builds and he's going to start working on it again after he's pushed out an update or two to antibirth
would this work?
\
``` function darkforce:my_update()
    if not have_darkforce_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local toph_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dark Forces" )
        if player:HasCollectible(darkforce_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then```
you have to add the mod callback
there's more than just that though
kilburn threw it together in two weeks but stopped working on it after ab+ was announced
well it isn't as robust but the documentation and syntax is miles ahead
<@66197463593136128> probably gonna be better than actual api
my_update() is the function
tophmod is the name
function tophmod:my_update()
    if not have_toph_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local toph_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Earthbending" )
        if player:HasCollectible(toph_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
is toph the mod name or a fuction
wait
True
limt's close
none of the other testers can top him
true
pajeet is master antibirth api boi tbh
essentially antibirth has a work in progress lua api as well
recognized the name
close enough
¯\_(?)_/¯
antibirth tester
well
the code for which I do not know. so you'll have to figure that out.
hi
Oh is that one of the antibirth devs
you add an effect to them
so now that you hvae all the tears in the room
not used to Lua
It has been hard not to put a semicolon at the end of every line
how do do I use this to create auras for my tears?
enemy tears are projectiles
your tears are tears
yeah that's exactly like the antibirth api
which is EntityType.ENTITY_PROJECTILE
yeah
they're considered projectiles or something
enemies use a different entity type for projectiles
o
no it won't
I don't think so
that will affect enemy tears too
but like
then to get all the tears in the room
to check if the player has the item
that's my function that I use
what
<@267112861921181697> function tophmod:my_update()
    if not have_toph_item then
        local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
        local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
        local toph_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Earthbending" )
        if player:HasCollectible(toph_item) then
            for i = 1, #entities do
                if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
*lil brimstone
so I assume it's not linked to the player entity only
well brimstone lasers come out of monsters and a familiar (brimstone baby)
cya
cya
going to sleep now cya and thx <@116386733905412105>
How would I get a brimstone to fire from an entity that's not the player?
how is this supposed to help me create an Aura effect?
yeah
and you change stats with them
updates stats I suppose
<@174193097285173250> were you working on the reflashing of isaac?
oh
cache flags trigger once
tearflag, shotspeed, firedelay, etc
oh you wanted help ty but yea seems like it works^^
What does the cache do?
seems like^^
apparently you just figured it out with frames?///
<@120355885615808512> is framecount persistent?
```<passive achievement="156" cache="tearflag shotspeed firedelay range damage" description="God tears" gfx="collectibles_331_godhead.png" id="331" name="Godhead" special="true" />```
was trying to figure out your on game start problem
nothing
<@116386733905412105> what did you want?
IE: lose your items, respawn in first room as The Lost or something, then regain your items upon pickup of your "souls"
send help
not in a code way though
I'm smart like that
seems like it works
okay
haha
etc.
and I figured h was head
I have been wondering if a Dark Souls like death is possible
I saw a video earlier
neat.
how did you get that?
?
yes
Like in yogioh
Is that the card body thing?
```lua
function Xitems:PlayerInit()
    if FrameCount > Isaac.GetFrameCount() then
        H = false;
        LA = false;
        RA = false;
        LL = false;
        RL = false;
    end
    
    FrameCount = Isaac.GetFrameCount()
end```
that should work right?
True\
I am wondering if it is even possible
godhead has aura tears
okay, there is something I have been wondering about
and my game still wont start :(
im back
Ill check the items screen in boi
dunno
Missing contact?
Mom's eye?
hur?
I was thinking of the one that gives shielded tears
that's the wrong item though
I noticed that at the last second
o
the achievement bit tells you which achievement unlocks the item I believe
<passive achievement="35" cache="tearcolor tearflag" description="Freeze effect" gfx="Collectibles_110_MomsContacts.png" id="110" name="Mom's Contacts" />
why
but otherwise only once
and on luamod yourmod
The only Mom's Contact reference in Items.xml is an achievment
and on mod disable enable
yes
<@120355885615808512> does main.lua for the mod run once on game load?
where are unpacked resources stored? I wasn't paying attention to the command prompt
<@134478547795443712> does post_player_init occur on floor start?
not the .xml files
At least that's what I have been told
but those items are in C++
I would look at Mom's Contact
<@267112861921181697> you can unpack the resources and look at examples of similar items
<@236635041856225280> nice idea
<@120355885615808512> did you searched a function to check game time?
can I make something that only triggers at the start of a floor?
(Is cursing allowed here? I forget)
and I don't know how to organize my files
I don't know how to make the Aura visible and how to make it effect things.
like no shit
you'll need an entry in items.xml and a mod callback for MC_POST_UPDATE
Is there a way to differ a new game and a game you continued?
<@266032468853915650> it just saves a string of text, right? then you overwrite it each time you call it
Like, I could copy some code and edit it to work on health and on Challenge rooms instead, but I cant make my own items for shit.
same
I got some bits and pieces from the Reddit.
I know what I need to do, I don't know how to execute it
but what I gave you should point you in the right direction step-by-step
oh god... player_init is called after continuing the game too
I doubt anybody could just instantly put the code together from what I gave you
I'm not that kind of person
I can't just read something and get it automatically
I kind of just want a guiding hand
that's too much like my job
I know the basics like registering an item
well I'm not sure anybody wants to just sit and write code for you
I am retarded and don't know shit about how to do that
Ahem
<@267112861921181697> register the item to the game, add a check in your update for if the player currently has the item, if the player has the item update all of the tear entities in the room with your aura effect
(I was told to come here from the Reddit)
I want to call it Dark Forces
Can someone help me make an item that gives tears an "aura" that inflicts Fear on anything that comes in contact with the Aura?
maybe it's an Effect?
I can't find EntityTear.
EntityPlayer, EntityPickup, etc.
like, there are classes that inherit from Entity
ANYWAY, Can someone help me make a simple passive item? I tried some tutorials earlier but they don't work, either the mod is old and deleting the updates file doesn't work, or it just doesn't work.
No I meant mypfp
stop it, ill take the computer away from you
anyway, can anyone help me make a simple passive item?
no, stop the meme mods
shit I should have done Robbie rotten
anyone know how SaveModData works?
^
what am I doing with my life
I'm trying to get the damage each tear will deal
I've got a list of all the entities that are tears
you can loop through all the room entities and do an if check if it's a tear
I must be going about this all wrong
and the functions want the number
it's justa number
ya
<@122924009527574530> all it says is ENTITY_TEAR = 2
how  can I save?
is there a callback for when a run starts or is finished? player_init?
ill go classical I guess
since it's a reuseable pill
dunno if that will help
<@236635041856225280> you can save mod data
a big chest Kappa
I would do overwatch but that's cancerous
use the enums file
what should my profile pic be?
i lose my variable data
for ENTITY_TEAR
why can't I find the stupid api page
I never sleep
<@116386733905412105> yes, i save the stat increase/decrease in a local variable, and update the cache with this variable, but when the game is restarted
tztz
kids dont use drugs
right?
yea, let's just pop amfetamines and stay awake
xD
and how do I write vectors in here
what position is the middle of the room?
accurate
<@122924009527574530> http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/darksouls/images/5/5c/Andre_(2).jpg
fuck sleep, amirite?
What are you doing here? ?
ayy
lol
I like big chests...
no ending though
it's big chest
found it
He means that the Damage Up effect does not stay when you quit and continue
<@236635041856225280> do you mean to say the damage up from the pill is erased when you quit the game then continue?
brb
Oh shit I have no profile pic
hi.
Hello?
I'm trying to make a dmg up pill, but if the game is reset, I lose my mod data
anyone knows if  can I make a variable persistent in save file?
never used the room editor ? where do I see more stuff <@116386733905412105>
yea
that's not to say you can't, though
for the look
ok ty
btw I didn't see anything for adding custom debug commands
I doubt there's an easy way to do that...
Alright, so my ricochet tears are kinda working now. All I need to do NOW is make it so the initial enemy that's shot is immune to the tear
@me no good idea to type in stage 15 in console
I guess
it's a grid entity
dunno run the room editor and take a look-see
which Id? ?
ok?
it's in the room editor
I should play Isaac
but couldn't
I tried to find that in the entity list
I liked the idea and it's not really likely to get all 5 cards
I think I will wait until I get a windows computer before I try this stuff
you can drop a trophy/end game chest can't you?
^^
will have to find a better way to show this
just exodia things
auto win ?
<@120355885615808512> they restart the game? or do they just auto-win
there are other clues, such as at what point during runtime did it crash
<@183454711834345473> check your log.txt
when I put my mod into the mod folder it crashed the game >.< what did I do wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_BzKcNKWk4&feature=youtu.be
here a sneak peak what the cards do ?
ambush?
events?
anyone got any idea how to start the angel fight?
hang on bagon seeing if I can find it...
Normalized() is the one that returns a vector
Yeah, that would probably be it
Oh, crap
try Normalized() instead
maybe it's the Normalize()?
yes
still crashes
like add console commands?
what do you mean
uhm is there a way to write scripts for the console?
you can use Isaac.DebugString(string) to print to the debug screen
Hopefully they are.
I'm assuming your speed and target variables are all prim and proper
I'll try that.
did you try false false false?
there's my entire log.txt
http://pastebin.com/wVyQUU3z
OOOH I see I didn't set the values to false after the run FailFish
what about the lines prior to the exception?
wtf now it stopped working again lol
that's what appears when the game crashes
[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...
<@72413153614368768> what does your log.txt say
my fault
and didn't reload the mod
yea i just used luamod
delete the update.it and fix the error and you're good to go
<@120355885615808512> every time your code has an error in it it creates an update.it and gets tagged as old
it's the FireTear bit that does it
ok so apparently this code makes my game crash : https://hastebin.com/molutexoma.lua
<@116386733905412105> nevermind.. just decided to work now lol, the mod randomly became "old" tagged, I deleted update.it, now it works. thank you very much!
http://imgur.com/nhYPReH
I need an example of an item like Head of the Keeper for my mod idea ?
xD
wow
okay
oh
xD
doesn't work with items
so long as you pick the next-lowest available integer.
I think you can declare the id yourself too
indeed.
yes but that's very hacky ?
it's just the next lowest available integer
you can probably guess at what the card id is
when the mod registers it
yea
did you set a custom hud value?
yea
the card reference?
<@116386733905412105> haha wow it doesn't work for custom items
<@266032468853915650> that is sick as hell
yes
plus we would have had so many examples :P
but, too late for that now obviously
they should have just made the content for afterbirth+ using the tools, then the things it was lacking would have been obvious
<@72413153614368768> do you have the api version 1 in registermod?
then we'd have a (probably) great API and great samples
they are all http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835650828
I wish the dev just tried making a decent amount of mods based on popular suggestions on the reddit, adjusting the API as needed for whatever mods he was making
there's a few on the steam workshop
what is the dev's sample mod called?
I'm glad people are starting to make some cool stuff out of this, with a bit more dev attention this api may save the game yet :v
tyrone
who thought it was a good idea to add an update.it file every time there was an error
looks interesting
picking up poop boosts damage?
woah, that's sick
I think
https://gfycat.com/HeftyClearcutGrayling wow I did something unique for once
shoot any grid entity
shockwave tears bois
is that only when you shoot rocks?
this.. could be useful https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlFHpFx3LjLAZdS/giphy.gif
ty
worked on that like 4 hours
it works
nice idea dude
?
what happens if you try the hud?
<card description="Revel in the power of darkness" hud="15_TheDevil" id="16" name="XV - The Devil" />
that's explaining a lot... I had difficulties before..
neat
haha tried it with "Joker" doesn't work either
yea
<@266032468853915650> are your tears charging up the lazor?
the custom card might not be registered yet
when you make the call to GetCardIdByName
right but I mean
I have it in my hand xD
the custom card may not be loaded in yet?
no
i did something that happened https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsVBoYvTtP10y4g/giphy.gif
yes
or for a preexisting one?
is it for a custom card
not sure then
copied it
yes
oke ^^
are you sure you have the correct card name?
GetCardIdByName("Devil") or something like that
Alright, I ended up doing it like that
yes I know that ?
okay, I'm gonna copy that down so I don't forget, thanks EatMeReturns
you need to pass it a name
does anyone know how Isaac.GetCardIdByName() works? because it's always returing -1 for me
```        local closestDist = 9999999
        local closestID = 0
        for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i]:isEnemy() then
                local dist = player.Position:DistanceSquared(entities[i].Position)
                if  dist < closestDist then
                    closestDist = dist
                    clostestID = i
                end
            end
           end```
<@183454711834345473> you'll need to learn the lua programming language. after that, subscribe to the example mods from the steam workshop. use these as examples. they will download to My Games -> Afterbirth + Mods the next time you run the game.
I'm probably being really dumb, but I'm putting all of the distances into a table. I have no way to know what distance applies to what entity
so bare minimum knowledge
a small bit (I learned game maker language for a game project ? )
do you have any programming knowledge?
would anyone be able to link me a place where I could learn how to mod?
why?
But the issue I'm ahving is figuring out which distance is associated with which entity
That makes it much easier.
enough to get the closest distance
Alright.
jup
It just returns c^2 instead of c?
exactly
So I'd imagine that DistanceSquared is just the exact same thing just without the sqrt?
xD
so i was using sqrt haha
cause i didn't know that the Vector class had these functions and i was doing it without the vector function
and squarerrot is painfully slow
pythagoras takes squareroot from a² + b²
distance is calculated by pythagoras as you know
<@!152984637264756736> there are probably more text files in the same folder as your log.txt. it's creating a minidump when it has the exception. good luck figuring out what's happening in there though
Just wondering
What's the difference?
if you do that, please use Vector:squaredDistance, and not Distance, saves a lot of performance
thats less painful
or rather, the closest enemy to another enemy
but possible
that would be painfull to do  performance wise
is there an easy way of finding the closest entity to another entity
well, try it out ^^
would be painful for the player to see them being destroyed though
no that could be great
not too beautiful tho
you could just delete every entity that spawns of that type
np. ^^
or can I replace pickups with null or something
yeah mate sorry i can't figure it
how do I stop a certain type of pickup from spawning?
http://pastebin.com/UrRY7zaQ
dose this say anything helpful?
ok uhh
oke! cya, and thanks ^^
bye !
i need to stop for today
well it's a terrible idea though
there's the open source Chronometrics Basement Renovator in python that reads those binaries
yup
that makes it more complicated tbh
ye
oh, 2x2?
hm
yeah i could do that... i even have some similar script laying around somewhere
Room.SetGridPath?
its a 2x2 room completely full of entities
just saying
you could make a script to convert the binary room to a lua file
thats what i thought about. but no. fuck that, that would be a real pain in the ass xD
have any of you had any success with custom tear variants?
you're welcome
let me look at that n try and figure it out
hardcode the grid data of your room in LUA and spawn grid entities at the start of the run :p
yeah
right?
i know you can do it in debug console
idk i can't figure it out my b
but i know
i don't think so
is there a way to only do that in a challenge? that would be even better
ok wondered why there was no animation
yep
just return true in the function?
<@109624258317033472>  make your room Special: starting room with weight=9999 ?
found this in the description of MC_USE_ITEM:  Return true to show the "use item" animation, otherwise false. What do I have to do?
one sec
idk mate
teleport to it?
how do I get the run's seed?
the only mod i have subbed now is a music replacement mod
<@96016391173332992> Queen of Hacky-ness. Do you know a way to force a room to appear at the start of a run? a custom made one.
the two mods might not be playing nicely with each other or something if you had each working individually
brimstomp is brimstone mixed with whore of babalon
brimstump or something like that and hotheaded
in the log you pasted it had an exception after only two mods were loaded
oh
he did
uninstall isaac
still wont work
almost uninstalled all mods
:(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
oh, ok.
Mod:SaveData(string) = Isaac.SaveModModData(Mod, string)
there's an Isaac.SaveModData
but each saving of data overwrites the last, so you have to figure out how you're gonna save it all as text
ok this doesn't seem right
detecting the start of the run requires you also store the seed with Mod:SaveData
so you have to reset it
but that's persisten between runs
Mod:LoadData
Mod:SaveData(string data)
That's what I mean save it the normal way
here's the reddit thread for some love
then what are SaveModData, LoadModData for?
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mhl1k/the_networking_of_isaac/
<@229593818691928067> sure, why not?
then overwrite it on new run
you have to save it the normal way
here comes transit
is it possible
does anyone know how to save a value for the current run
alright
still nice
ah
a dude from here did
i didnt make it
i forgot to unsub
nice*
moce
its's custom made
ohh!!
that  causes the crash
code for what?
whats the code?
well, that log doesnt tell us anything. its creating a minidump
<@266032468853915650> How's you get that debugging window?
http://pastebin.com/mvnBwcVu
heres the log i was talking about
oh!
people rping as issac characters
make a split-screen racing mod, with microtransactions
just imagine
issac mmorpg
are you going to make an Isaac MMO ?
holy shit <@122924009527574530>
i have absolutely no clue from networking, but isnt lua so slow that it would create some latency?
this is to show that it can be done and will work
lol I did... something, I guess
that's the just time consuming work
so you could see another user
and another can connect to that server
the server can do whatever
you can send any data you want
if you go to bed now, youll be fucking dead if you wake up in 4 hours
does it only track movement right now?
you and your ideas
that's sweet
^
just sleep on the plane
thats hella cool ?
promise
writing a reddit thread and then going to bed
Indeed
Hello Network!
https://streamable.com/qryl7
but none of the other tear anm2s have an idle animation
and then use it for something else
Can I use the tears flag
so apparently my tear variant is missing an idle animation
do a pastebin and link it I guess
ok can i paste it
it's not in My Games -> Afterbirth + Mods though
in My Games -> Afterbirth +
ok
you can look at the log.txt
hmm
before that though
to the offender
to all of them?
gotta unsubscribe
ohhh
it still crashed
any mods you subscribed to in steam will re-download
and ran the game
i took out the mods in the folder
how do you know it isn't any of the mods?
and veryfying game chache thingy
ive tryied reinstalling
reinstall
Yeah whoops just found it lol sorry bout that
my game crashes on start now and it isnt any of the mods :(

^
how would you prefer lua over the beauty of c or c++
c, c++, java, javascript, actionscript...
Hopefully this is simpler than the bitwise ops: how do I just make Isaac take damage lol
certainly not
i only accept your opinion if lua is the only language you've tried
lua is my favorite language
fucking lua
0h shit
wouldnt it be entities[i]:CollidesWithGrid()
the 1st if statement works
<@116386733905412105> yeah i changed it and now it can get the entity type but it cant het collision ```          if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
            if entities[i].CollidesWithGrid() then
              print("col")
            end
          end```
but theres for sure a smarter method
w8 no. not nvm. you could actualy use modulo. silly me
<@266032468853915650> try Isaac.GetRoomEntities() instead
nvm
I was trying to use the bits module, but it doesn't seem to be loaded
The `CacheFlag`s are bitwise flags, right? How do I do bitwise operations in lua? lol
?
flight smight
yea yea
1 sec I'll make a video
but isnt your flight going in like, 5 hours?
<@122924009527574530> how cool is that ?
this is surreal
omg I have networking working
#entities gives "attempt to get length of a userdata value (local 'entities')"
I'm bad at this thing.
Do I keep the test mod thing
```          for i = 1, #entities do
          if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR then
            print("ok")
          end
        end``` why does this not work?
thanks
It was posted a while back.
anyone know how to spawn creep?
its in entitynpc
PlaySound
what's the function for playing a sound effect?
if it's for testing you could make that room a starting room with weight=99999
its not perfect
http://pastebin.com/KyiqzGkZ
<@109624258317033472> no idea how to go to a specific room :/
let me grab my code
Now, to find out how to do a Tears Up, and a Damage Down in the item code.
Kk thankss
<@!117109151334662144> firedelay
what are they
i keep getting runtime errors
thanks
hm. Good to know tho ?
it does work though i tried again
oh ok
or can i specify the start room or something like that? havent found anything ?
wait no <@229593818691928067> with change room i can only change to a room on that floor, i would like to teleport myself to a specific room i made in room editor. damn
what is tears if your doing 
`cache="tears damage"`
lets see
well, ill too give it a try
i put a random index
tried it, crashed the game :p idk
i must have overlooked that function. thanks mate
Level.ChangeRoom(int RoomIndex)
can i define a specific room?
you can use the telepill effect
is it possible to teleport to a custom room via code?
i don't know much sorry
<@!117109151334662144> take a look at the subreddit r/themoddingofisaac there's a few threads about changing stats
<@229593818691928067> does that work when picking up a item?
i.e. necronomicon or bible
one last thing, anyone know how to active the animation for a giantbook
where is player.anm2 ?
player.Damage = player.Damage / 2
I need to divide the current damage by two, and multiply the current "tears" by two.
no but you can look at them all if you unpack the graphics and then open player.anm2 with the anm editor included in the tools
they're the same animation but with slightly different timings
is there a list of the animations?
or 
`player:QueueExtraAnimation("UseItem")`
so you would just need
`player:QueueExtraAnimation("LiftItem")`
Okay thank you
in my mod I make the player play the jump animation repeatedly with
`player:QueueExtraAnimation("Jump")`
you can write to the log.txt with Isaac.DebugString
I'm talking about this thing ^^

you can print to the screen, I don't know how to write to the mod console, if you even can
what console?
Easy question. Is there a way to print to console?
if you just want him with arms in the air though you can totally do that
sweet
what Jacquerel said
Just return true in the function that the callback accesses.
but I'm not sure if you would be able to make that hold up a specific active item
there's a holding animation you could trigger on the player ?
PlayExtraAnimation lets you call anything from isaac's .anm file
You know how you have the Use Item callback?
plumbus
how do you do it for an active
well in that case
Is there a trick to getting the animation editor to work?
I don't know that sounds possible
Sorry :(
Yeah, it is.
unless it's intrinsically linked to the item activation
no this is for a passive item but I assume it's similar
Is this just for an active item?
anyone know?
Do it in the Cache callback thingy
EntityPlayer has attributes for stats
How do I get rid/add stats after a item is picked up?
how do you trigger isaac to hold an item above his head?
Answer.
Question.
:p
thats my plan
it actually ends the run when you pick it up
yeah thanks, just found it out ^^
spawn 5.370 <@109624258317033472>
Got it now
is it possible to manualy spawn the trophy that appears when finsihing a challenge?
it only searches things that BEGIN with your query
yes <@134478547795443712>
I put it in, and than it gave me Zodiac
or in lua use Isaac.GetItemIdByName("nameofyouritem")
ctrl+f and it appears 10 times
like I search a word and it comes up with no results
wait, you can define IDs in your items.xml?
pretty much
it said it was c512.
is it just me or is the search feature of the documentation WAY worse than just using ctrl+f?
start typing the name of your item in the game console and it will tell you the id
either there is an id to your item in items.xml or
that's all we can tell you
your item id is at least 511
ok
or Afterbirth+ Modding
I'm new to isaac modding.
I seriously don't know.
haha
><#205854501083545601> plebs
ok bois I just noticed I was in the wrong neighbourhood
you should know, it's your item
How do I find the item's ID
spawn 5.100.itemid
5.100.[item id]
I have a quick question. How do I spawn a pedastal with my modded item on it?
tells you the stats of each of your tears
Spidermodbuddy 3.0
not really helpful for anything other than getting entity ids
it's my debug mod lol
xD
<@72413153614368768> what the fuck.
on the workshop there are a few
on a side node, is there anywhere an exaample for a custom challenge?
```local mod = RegisterMod("Killer Queen", 1);
local itemBombTrans = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Bomb Transfusion");


local entdata

function mod:onBombTransuse()
  local entities = Isaac.GetEntitiesInRoom()
  for k, v in pairs(entities) do
    if v:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
      local pos = v.Position
      v:BloodExplode()
      Isaac.Explode(pos, v, 500)
    end
  end
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, mod.onBombTransuse, itemBombTrans);```
this is fine https://streamable.com/ddu4b
Buuuuuut. The actual item effect isn't functioning. G R E A T.
ohhh right sorry
apperently
is pad input accessible from Lua?
Sooo. The code I was given works. Or. Atleast. The item does.
usefull nontheless

nono, sorry. i mean the buttons you can walk on
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mejub/first_draft_of_new_item_the_axe/
someone on reddit did it
i think i saw something like this before, let me grab it
hmm
anyways, do one of you know how to?
im a real peach apperently ?
it just like peaches
holy shit robo baby
RoboBaby, what the fuck?
like, the ingame buttons you can walk on
is it possible to bind events to buttons?
:9
i cant find the devil room chanse
I did not know that
...Apparently coop babies have half the damage of Isaac
The normal Mom's Knife updates instantly, however
Interesting. The damage the knife from Yes Mother has only updates when you change rooms
procs on stat change
what dose MC_EVALUATE_CACHE do
including Mom's Knife
All projectiles a player fires gets their collision damage set to your damage
Wait, I already knew this
good thing i've got a debug mod that lists collision damage
maybe
?
does that mean that brimstone lasers that you shoot get their collision damage set to your damage stat?
what should i make the biology textbooks description
noice
the damage of a brimstone is controlled by the brimstone's collision damage ? `EntityLaser.CollisionDamage`
and make the bottom part of the mouth like the upper part
ye
although with coloring and shading it could look better
maybe make the top a bit more round?
doesn't look much like a cup, right?

yo
thinking of something to do with http
go for it
i'll look into figuring out the non-stopping networking on the lua end right now
good thought ola
so LoadChunk etc are enabled?
but idk how
i believe so zetaprime
just as a proof of concept
can a mod load and execute arbitrary lua?
thinking of packing the floats, sending them to the server, the server offsets them by 10 pixels or something and then I spawn an isaac sprite at that position
What folder do I use to try, and make a item with?
seems to be no way
now I'm wondering how to pack the lua floats into some IEEE format
that's networking for  ya
The thing I'm personally more concerned about is receiving messages non-stopping on the lua end
i dont code snake language
But no, nice ola!
>no proper async
how do y'all live
i'm personally a fan of 3.5
and I will fight you
2.7
I'm more a python 3.5 girl but to each their own :p
need python 2.7 for the server
<@96016391173332992> https://github.com/olafurw/isaac-networking/tree/master
<@!152984637264756736> like maybe it is still an active item, but when you use it, it makes you get older so you get bigger, and get more damage but less tears
Where can I get this beautiful console for `print`ing that everyone seems to use?
U could do it so everytime u click it he evolves
every floor
like he is evolving
but eliminates devils/angels
yeqah
but you could make it a passive that makes you stronger every time you enter a new floor
I know books are usually active items
hmmmmMMMmm
im not shure
what does it do?
oh that's cool
but no angle or devil rooms/items
its cool
sweet
yeah
biology textbook?
im going to make an evolution book item
1 sec
np
it looks good at normal scale
something I remember from my childhood
<@229593818691928067> yeah it's the "beginner's bible" sized down with a couple changes
was messaging someone else for a thing
sorry
yeah, totally <@122924009527574530>
most sprites have 2x outlines
is that the tree of Eden's garden ?
nah its ok
maybe the book is too thick
ok m'dudes i'm back
opinions on this sprite for a childre's bible?
and also when I'll know how to do that

When I'll get enough motivation at least
Okay, first project  sprite edit, replace the arcade cards and replace it with those ones :D
http://danbooru.donmai.us/data/__alice_margatroid_cirno_flandre_scarlet_hakurei_reimu_hijiri_byakuren_and_others_touhou_drawn_by_manaten__a0abdb688710b21a68baffdbe86e2605.gif
So to make an enemy shoot a brimstone: `EntityLaser.ShootAngle`
In the documentation it's listed as a member function but it's actually static. oh and the name makes sense, right ?
want the code?
nice!
<@96016391173332992>
np

Yeah, you apply the flag, then call EvaluateItems. Thanks!
sweet. hoped so
I had my debugging stuff commented out haha
<@96016391173332992>  Wait, nevermind! it does work!
hahaha
hm
<@96016391173332992>  Trying a couple cases with it, not working yet though
after adding to cache
but <@267065025024229377> does that work? I need the info for my mod as well
np
thank you
nah its cool
i forgot about that step my bad
OH xd
lmao
okay run the resources unpacker
i'm dumb
ohhhh
oh
if you don't your game ain't gonna work
there*
fam its not ther
i promise you i do in your isaac resources dude
<@96016391173332992> no, like i dont have the entitys2 thing in resources
Player:EvaluateItems() i should say
What if you add a `sounds.xml` alike the other xml files?
try `EvaluateItems ()` <@267065025024229377>
It might be possible, it might not be possible
I should probably try custom sounds tomorrow
no, like i dont have the entitys2 thing in resources
What does it mean if a mod reads name[OLD]?
it's in the room editor folder
it's not in resources
<@96016391173332992> I dont have that file in the resources folder
but not *immediately* yeah
it ends up applying whenever the stats are recalculated next (end of floor, another item that mods speed, etc.)
that's something i'm gonna be doing as well so i should check
idk then mate. lemme check
Basically, trying to get a stat thing to happen outside of having an item
because just adding the flags isn't gonna do shit
Yep
idk, Kirk. Haven't messed with that bit. are you adding an on cache callback to handle that cache?
Thanks
How do I make the game trigger a stat recalculation? `Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED)` doesn't seem to be working
good question. it's something i want to implement in my mod bitter but idk
is there a wiki or something where we can share our understanding of the API more easily ?
change the directory in `settings.ini` by adding /resources to the end <@152874880537198593>
Is there a way to make it play a custom sound on use?
Also, another question regarding this item.
aaaay i figured it out
Anyone know how to fix the room editor where it says  entitys2.xml isnt found?
this changes everything
Is it cricket? ?
black half hearts exist
b o r f
hold up
That's a pretty nice dog.
I'll give it a whirl. It's appreciated.
hackily, i'd argue
MY MASTERPIECE  IS DONE https://gfycat.com/OrneryHeavyBangeltiger
haha
It's good enough at the very least to (probably) be able to rework the health system
hopefully soon. it's becoming aight right now, but
When do you guys (or girls) think the official modding API would be better? I want to start modding by creating very simple items for a beginning :)
I also have more complex idea but... it's for the future
but eh
ipairs is for when it's more list-like
It uses `next` and unless things changed, it is faster ¯\_(?)_/¯
`pairs` just goes through all entries
I seriously doubt that but i'll google it
No reason to use ipairs
also you'd probably want `ipairs(entities)` for this
Pairs is also faster AFAIK
pairs is for iterating through dictionary type objects
because I find i=0,#entities notation easier mostly
'cause why not do that?
`for i, v in pairs(entities) do`
It's all good. Saves me [effort] in a real unique kind of gay way
Also protip
not sure if this is the place to ask this, so hopefully I'm not bothering anyone, but how do I make the game trigger a stat recalculation? `Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCacheFlags(CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED)` doesn't seem to be working
i just wanted to make that suddenly
also sorry for stealing the coding part from you :p
idk if that's *exactly* working
g r e a t
right?
```
function Mod:on_use()
  local entities = Isaac.GetEntitiesInRoom()
  for i=1,#entities do
    if entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
      local pos = entities[i].Position
      entities[i]:BloodExplode()
      Isaac.Explode(pos, entities[i], [damage])
    end
  end
end
```
?
set tear delay over 9000 Kappa
[Because you hardly wanna be giving people a suicide switch.]
can you change a champion variant of an enemy after creation?
Also probably gotta exclude the player entity itself from the ordeal, too.
obviously
Because if so you've *got* to do it with Entity.BloodExplode()
Yep.
do you want to kill them at the same time?
i guess, yeah
Just gotta get the entities of the room and then create an explosion at their location, right?
True. The first one sohuld be kinda simple.
haven't looked into the second one tho
the first one shouldn't be too difficult, yeah?
Also trying to grant the player the blindfolded condition out of challenge mode. [oh boy]
Trying to set up a [good item] that lets the player explode all of the enemies in the room. Think pay to win, but with more explosions.
stop, only12. I can only get so turned on
do you guys know if ROOM_DEFAULT is the first room of a floor?
yeah. try and make the head a bit more angular overall, but not flat up and down and to the sides like you are
Robo bitch
It's ment to be robot like, yeah.
make it more angular, if it's supposed to be a robot like i assume?
Oh, what items will it be? 
Looks cool!
[the bad sideways view]
haha
What you think is shitty art is impossible art for me ?
my art consists of colored shapes and texts floating around the room
its also better than anything i ever did ?
True. Gotta improve that schit.
you're pillowshading like hell tho
needs some shading
it's ok
?
eh, looks good mate
good idea thanks i might
Absolutely disgusting resprite.killme
(or you can win and play as the boss for the rest of the game, haha)
or as a challenge
that would actually be quite cool
try and make yourself lose
oh shit
you play as the boss
takes control of isaac
quality boss
alright thanks
hah
haha
so hey now the player randomly fire brimstone at the boss, who does nothing haha
Then you would create the entity, yeah
That's different
<@229593818691928067> Ah, okay
Do what you wish, tons of possibilities
oh but this is EntityPlayer.FireBrimstone... i want a boss to fire it
It's fiine
nah
i'll make something else then
oh
<@72413153614368768> I had that same idea ? I have an item that spawns tears from killed enemies that have the velocity to the nearest other enemy
so just save it to a variable
when you hit an enemy, the tear bounces off of the enemy to the nearest enemy
The FireBrimstone function returns the entity
ooh, i just had an idea for an item
or npc.ToLaser() ?
Do I need to create a separate entity for the brimstone ?
this robo baby is also randomly tagging emotes on various messages. im too, very confused
otherwise it will snap back to the player/parent
If you wish to change the origin of the brimstone laser remember to set its DisableFollowParent variable to true
thanks <@124088844181045249> !
and items?
what is this robo baby
the brimstone bending aspect
at least
hmm. I doubt one could implement Eye of the Occult in this...
You can modify the entity itself for more control
from EntityPlayer
<@229593818691928067> http://i.imgur.com/nbzI70l.png
im retarded. thanks
guys how do i shoot a brimstone ? ?
http://i.imgur.com/72Ma7rh.png
whether to load the textures immediately
<@228680372215349249> do you know what the boolean param is at Sprite:Load(anm2, bool) ?
Probably both
wonder if he actually has something or if he's just being an ass
then in post render, call update and renderlayer with the proper position
```lua
spr = Sprite()
spr:Load("path/to/stuff.anm2", true) 
spr:PlayOverlay("animation")
```
Sweet, added brimstone synergy to my item.
wtf, I've been tweeting at those guys with no answers ?
lmao
And he already emailed zath
Telling Tyrone to email zath about an exploit or he'll release it
Zatherz tweeted tyrone
hah
it's actually screen relative
or does some funky math have to be done probably
do you know
does screen coordinates take into account hud offset
brb
hah
nvm
ahh that guy
no hoops, 4 lines
it *has* to be an anm2
you have to jump through some hoops
i must be blind lmao
I'm using it
I know
it was already there
wait, drawing a sprite manually was added
yea
let me see if I can send isaac's position
<@122924009527574530> sockets?
drawing a sprite manually puts it *behind* the HUD :(
this was retardedly easy
I have working sending
hahahah
i'd still put it in post update personally but then i guess that might be before some mod item stuff so maybe postrender would be better
oh huh
postrender is after world render but before HUD AFAICT
as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure it is because i use that in my mod i'm working on
peffect_update, set hearts to one, then remove them in post render
but to remove it, on post update is probably before rendering
try it in the on cache update first just to make sure you can't take the easy way out
alright, i'll try this
<@72413153614368768> I have a hack around that that kind of sort of works
or smth like that
try to detect item pickups, then add a soul heart, but remove it before render
?
final
When I'll want to really start modding I'll find a good item to have base on
i can't even use the lost trick of giving half a soul heart because you can't hide your hearts
o shit
KyoZM I foudn your megabrim mod on workshop x)
rip
tfw i make my numerical hp mod only to have it so that every time i pick up an item i die
xD
dose anyone know how to use the anm2 editor
<@266032468853915650> I'm here
[g r e a t]
How evil of you to springboard off of someone else's mod.
omg
and i stole the costume and made my own out of it >:)
i found a mod with a custom costume
gotcha
oh cool!
making a boss, reproducing a Duke of flies movement
what're you up to? :p
we already have bouncing tears tho
gotcha :p
detected which corner of the room, then if horizontal or vertical, then flip either X or Y velocity component
or
detected when it was close to a border and changed the movement vector i guess?
<@109624258317033472> i got the bouncing off walls working. Genius ?
guess i should probably put the mod i'm working on on github actually
did I drop it? sorry I'll pick it up, didnt wanna mess the place up
lol
damn
you guys really dropped your knowledge right there
np. i'm going out for a smoke for a minute anyway
afk
give me a few minutes, ill come back here
hehe
yeah, but don't look too much. tons of unfinished projects and the only finished ones are too old to look good :p
you use github?
xD
I'm up for it
lets do this
10pm now, flight leaves at 6am
actually curious now
would be cool
that's why I was thinking of just the smallest amount of code you can imagine to send stuff and the rest of the work is somewhere else
I'm a linux user myself, so I could build the .so if you get something working, and I'd love to help a little if you'd like
ya
you'd have to build a dylib for that ofc
no, probably were
did you check if they were mac users?
so there's some edge cases probably
i'd guess they'd block requires in their, but I guess you could manually load it
yea but note that I tried it with my mod and some users complained about it not working
i hadn't really tested that yet
so you can write a C wrapper that does the heavy work
can you? nice
<@96016391173332992> you can get current file's folder so you can have .dll's in the mod folder
gotta hope for the best now
E-mailed isaac@nicalis in hopes of getting an answer on using the special characters that are in the font so my translation works properly
with their own stack, that might work
ahh they have coroutines
keep in mind that technically speaking it should be possible to add c modules to resources/scripts in the actual isaac folder
dunno if they have threads
hmm yea only learned lua in the last few days
then again my experience with asynchronous networking doesn't really extend that far. I'm mostly used to just using libs for it, not building from the ground up
Yeah. And I don't know how to do threading in lua, and I'd really like to be able to do that for multiplayer. At least need some decent asynchronous that I'm 90% socket doesn't handle on it's own
yea it's really in a "dunno" state now
haven't gotten too far since I haven't tested much of anything
cool man
yeah, i've been putting together how to send all of the data necessary with small amounts of actual information in my offtime
hehe
The Networking of Isaac
so anyone can write services that recives the data
building networking in lua lmao
<@96016391173332992> I think the smart idea to start with is to make a generic library that sends data from the client
What is it with swedish game devs, man. Buncha crazy motherfuckers
some beautiful countries, sweet ?
I've been thinking of getting a speedrunning mod going, but that either requires me to hook up to the Speedrunslive IRC server or have a server that handles it specifically, since I'm not gonna fuck with Peer to Peer
< my twitter handle as well if you're curious
Iceland currently, from there, xmas vacation, live in sweden
vacation?
where are you at? ^^
hehe, flying home tomorrow, so nothing today
yes
but have fun mate
it is really really hard
gonna be a bitch, still
fair enough
xD
but I've done this a few times
sorry for the title dropping
< game dev, programmer for 18 years ?
but yes, *technically* feasible, as I've discussed before
it's impossibly hard to build online multiplayer on *top* of a game
so the rest is just work
but we know isaac's position, the seed, the room he is in, and lua has networking libraries
sounds cool tho!
<@109624258317033472> dunno
np Kyo
I doubt most mods save much data, though, so you can just save the seed directly then do tonumber(stringseed) to get it back
Keep in mind you really do need to save the seed using Mod:SaveData(string) to make it work after closing the game
thanks
THEY KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
<@122924009527574530> do we even have possibilites to edit how the rooms generate?
new run code
https://ptpb.pw/0pB3.lua/lua
xd just ideas
<@266032468853915650> probably not too interesting to code ? thanks tho!
or that the seed is global
<@109624258317033472> Item: "Panic Attack" Effect: "FireDelay- SPD+"
also thinking if you can make an infinite floor and let people join the floor
network multiplayer would be SICK
I've written servers like that before
since lua has networking libraries
or network multiplayer
thinking if you can do an mmo
see if anyone comes up with ideas
neato, I'm kinda done for now, probably gonna let the mod stew for a bit since it's generally working
keep in mind you need to use Mod:SaveData to save the seed so it persists through restart
lemme type what i've got out in portable code
<@122924009527574530> finding new ideas ?
on continue
on restart
>continue run also triggers it
when else does PLAYER_INIT trigger?
burp, what are you guys upto?
? what is it
<@96016391173332992> it isnt? ?
nah mate i've got one better
closest thing :b
<@266032468853915650> still spreading that shit that MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT means a new run, you scoundrel? :p
because
Plum..Bus... why xD
I tied both and it doesn't work for me, I'm sure I have some weird bug. I think I'm going to tap out until there's more documentation haha. Thanks for all the help everyone
<:plum:259939492008296448> ? , you there? Kappa
also <@162306308752670721>  you may want to change from 50 to 500 cause when a run starts the screen is black already
? ?  WHO DID THIS
may it stay forever
i absolutely love that plum emote
right ?
that was from weed
xD
no
including Green Isaac ? ?
and the other half
half of my mod ideas came from Dream Theater - In the presence of enemies Part 2
sounds good.
always work
listen to music
im out of mod ideas. halp
you can do Isaac.DebugString("it worked"), it'll go in log.txt
cheers
the screen will go dark
do Game():Darken(1,50)
not sure how to test if that actually ran for me then

I don't take it it's possible yet to add new characters without needing to replace core files and thus causing conflicts with other mods that would also want to do so?
i have a custom terminal
Thank god there is a way to do things like that !
no
<@266032468853915650> does that print to the log file?
wth
doesnt look so beautiful tho
no. i faced your problem once and just rotated it in one direction, if its the wrong one it will automaticly rotate 3 times so its correct
but if i don't know which wall it's touching can i know which direction to rotate the velocity ?
So my entity has a Velocity, and when it touches a wall i want it to bounce off like the Duke of flies
maybe he faced the problem i'm facing now
i'll try to contact the guy that translated the game to spanish
sick
thank you
itemExpansion:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , itemExpansion.newRun)
--[[New Run--]]
function itemExpansion:newRun( )
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  
  print("[ItemExpansion] New Run Detected!")
  hasReckoning = false
end
or what do you mean
a function that only gets called when the game starts?
can anyone give me like a very simple script they know works when a new game starts?
Can you get the amount of pickups a player as? Like bombs, keys, and coins?
<@229593818691928067>  "wait does it" DONT LEAVE ME HANGING HERE D:
The font for the text of items, floors and etc.. is terminus_0 , right?
wait does it
that'll work
right ?
sadly, its not said which one, but its the best youve got
if its true, its colliding with a wall
<@109624258317033472> that's a boolean, what does it say ?
<@198846198122151937> i've seen this when messing with velocity, you must a position/velocity that's either invalid or out of bounds
Entity:CollidesWithGrid ()
it spams my log.txt every time I'm testing this entity
should i just check its position every update or is there a collider of some kind ?
does anyone know what this error means  Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 118, Subtype: 0; Pos: 320.000000, 280.000000; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000Entity Teleport Detected! Type: 3, Variant: 118, Subtype: 0; Pos: 320.000000, 280.000000; Size: 0.000000, 0.000000
would it be possible to add these to the font, somehow?
how would i go about the collision of an entity with a wall ? i want it to bounce on it
Ehh :frowning:
does ```player.FireDelay = player.FireDelay - 1``` not work?
the difficulty is a constant. sadly no
Hi, is there any way to change difficulty mid-game?
If it's not in the font, it's not in the font...
so, there's no way to use foreign symbols when editing item names, right? Like á ã â ç etc...
yeah I've been bashing my head against it for a day haha
that's weird
```test:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, test.Tester)``` works just the same, nothing on start until run from console
yes
player:GetName() -> Cain
tested, works
try EntityPlayer::GetName ?
there is atleast a player enum
Or, can you at all?
How can you check what character you're currently playing as?
yeah sorry that bit might be wrong because I've been trying loads of things, I'll try
what are the other parameters supposed to be ?
i'm not sure
try `test:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, test.Tester)` ?
yay
Victory!
ah I see
``` testing ```
(probably... some keyboards are weird)
it's not ', it's ` over by ~
It's super basic just to start testing
sorry
ok I didn't understand haha

yeah, I'm new to discord though, are there like code tags?
can you show me your code Robb ?
nvm i got it `npc.GridCollisionClass = GridCollisionClass.COLLISION_WALL `
Yo, I don't spose anyone knows why a main.lua file wouldn't run on load, but using luamod in the console runs it fine? No errors in log
how can i make an custom entity have flight ? is it an EntityFlag ?
Wow...
you're setting the timer to -1 at each timer() call

Any ideas?
And it still doesn't work!
This is about the fifth time I've rewritten this mod...
Aand now that that's done, I now have to make damage values for every entity in the game that can deal damage...
i just had to make the damage not be 0
wow. so i figured out invincibility
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872
New mod made by ©  Wofsauge INC.
Anyone knows what the color offset does in the color class?
Well, second after the mod table
https://hastebin.com/itaravabeh.lua
ty!
<@266032468853915650> The second argument is the flag
that works specifically for my situation and this situation only
is there a way fo find wich flag gets updated on MC_EVALUATE_CACHE ? [2]
I didn't want to recommend using & and | blindly
so not really important to me lol
i found a hacky way around it
<@126590786945941504> That's awesome!
<@134478547795443712> congratz!
<@83630921097437184>
Because there's bitwise operators in 5.3
But there's no bit32
Not sure if still relevant
oh lord
Guys I just found my first bomb bum
can you divide the interface in tabs ?
this here is Moddign of Isaac
ah ok
noo the different channel
They mean on the main Isaac Discord
this is <#205854782542315520>
you mean <#220581404612886528>?
this is <#205854782542315520>
there's activity on Binding of Isaac <#205854782542315520> too
ogg
Ok
<@240743817530179584>  If you follow anyone's tutorial on getting modding set up in the first place, you then just go into the sfx/music folder and replace the desired .ogg file.
well. you create a music file, save it as .ogg, and crete a mod folder and put it in the corect folder structure
is Blind Rage the only thing that increases invincibility between hits?
there are 2?
Then how do you do it?
why is there 2 modding rooms :/ i want to be in both
you dont need a mod tool for that ^^
I sorta just wanna mod music tbh
Oh I was searching the tool area of the steam library
even though i dont think you meant that
Animation editor, roomEditor, ModUploader ResourceExtractor and ItemPool editor are the tools we have
öhhh
he talked about all of them
The one tyrone talked about
which one?
What is the name of the afterbirth + mod tool?
i thinkhe did a mod that pooped a red poop
someone on r/moddingofisaac did that
ok i need to figure out how to hack in invincibility frames
is there a way fo find wich flag gets updated on MC_EVALUATE_CACHE ?
even though it's a stupid solution lmao
i'm glad that i had a solution though
i suppose
Guess I have to write it myself
No bit32 ?
since every other flag is an even number, so DAMAGE_NOKILL would make the number odd
and i can check if the number is odd
i can check if the flags given are greater than DAMAGE_FAKE, since that means it has to have DAMAGE_FAKE
since DAMAGE_FAKE is the largest number, and DAMAGE_NOKILL is 1
this is the stupidest way to detect if there's the DAMAGE_FAKE flag and the DAMAGE_NOKILL flag
isaac doesn't have bit32 :(
rip
I'm gonna mod Space Funeral stuff into issac
This guy talks about binary
https://youtu.be/DPfMATdVN-w
In his coin vid
The half A press guy talks about it
I think 4 binary slots = 9 or something like that
and vice versa
i'm dumb
uh... so how do i convert the decimal to binary?
I'm gonna mod issac so the will shit talks me
I can't test it, hence me talking and asking questions and making assumptions!
?
what am i doing i can just test this lol
Does bit32.bor accept integers or only binary?
so to add the stuff together i'd make it a bit32.bor(DAMAGE_NOKILL, DAMAGE_FAKE, flags) ?
alright
001 or 101 = 101
That's a bitwise or
hm.... since i'm adding the flags that the damage had into the takedamage function, how would i make it so that it doesn't add the fake and nokill flags a second time?
guessing not because value type
can you modify the flags in the callback?
can you modify the flags in the callback?
001 and 101 = 001 (~= 0 thus TRUE)
nokill with explosion would be 5, so 101
```DamageFlag = {
  DAMAGE_NOKILL = 1,            -- damage can not kill the receiver
  DAMAGE_FIRE = 1<<1,            -- source is some sort of fire (ie. fireplace) (2)
  DAMAGE_EXPLOSION = 1<<2,    -- (4) 
... --and so on```
alright, good
Yup
would that just do something like 11010010 and 01001010 = 01000010 ?
The flags are set up for it already
except that i don't know how binary in programming works lol
it should be
if it's available
bit32.band() could help with that
a littlebit hacky but yeah... that would work
actually i could probably just convert the flag into binary and check if the two bits that are the DAMAGE_FAKE and DAMAGE_NOKILL flags are 1
The random emotes from RoboBaby are confusing as fuck
So your player has invincibility but takes your fancy new damage?
But then I wouldn't be able to detect the DAMAGE_FAKE and DAMAGE_NOKILL flags
The only thought that I have is throwing the flags from the original damage into the TakeDamage function
someone on the reddit forum posted how he did that
How do you mod music into afterbirth+ ?
you could just hackily add invinc frames by our own
It works fine other than invincibility
I've tested this
It returns true by default
The issue I'm having is that I'm not geting invincibility
I think return true ignores flags
so it won't kill you
the damage has the DAMAGE_FAKE and DAMAGE_NOKILL flags
but that time you return true, which is real damage
since the if statement checking for the flags the TakeDamage gives activates before the TakeDamage
thought so ? thanks
if you look the TakeDamage will never be reached a second time
Cool! Seems like it could potentially be really interesting
Putting TakeDamage in a take dmg callback is a recipe for disaster, innit?
<@70946604139425792> yep. It does
yes
And is this in a take dmg callback?
There may be an issue with your flags
that grants invincibility
this is my current code : https://hastebin.com/eqotilusuc.lua
isn't there an example item from nicalis on the workshop
"Return true or nil if the entity or player should sustain the damage, otherwise false to ignore it."
sorry false
that's what i'm doing
could you just return true on player take damage to ignore the damage?
i still have to put in custom damage for every single entity in the game
well, dealing damage will be solved
if i can figure this out then damage will be solved
alright, how do you give the player invincibility?
<@109624258317033472> Does it bounce around the room like peep's eye
except for the fact that it's not giving a damage cooldown properly :(
holy shit i got it to work
strong familiar but it makes it hard to aim and hard to predict where enemy tears come from
very attractive
Watchu guys think? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836249223
Well, when I print player.FrameCount it works fine
Nah
Knife baby.
Two words
Guys I have an idea
ah, ok
also. Lua is loosely typed, spaces don't matter
it is defined
i dunno
and you need to define player before
every 2 seconds it should do the thing so
player.FrameCount is the correct one
you could probably solve this yourself if you print player.FrameCount
Yeah, I don't see how that would be a problem
player.FrameCount is from when the player was created
that gets the global frame count
ok, let me try
i think
Isn't it Game():GetFrameCount()?
that would do the same thing
IsFrame(60, 0)
modulo is better
i don't understand,  example pls
instead of the modulo
try IsFrame (integer Frame, integer Offset)
its the if statement
fucking ctrl+F is failing me
the fire tear works
all entities have FrameCount
when I tried to do that
its on the docs
player:GetAimDirection() didn't work for me
also
since when does player have FrameCount
its the if statement thats wrong
hm.
oh
that worked before
and before the ()
remove the space after GetAimDIrection
```if player.FrameCount % 60 == 0 then
          player:FireTear(player.Position, player:GetAimDirection () * 10, false, false, false)
        end``` any idea why this isnt working?
He should stick to snarky twitter posts about donald trump ?
<@266032468853915650> I wouldn't trust Tyler's stance on anything related to games since he's yet to make a good one
gj
there you go ?
and so on
so i take damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage from taking damage
oh geez
it's cause i'm calling the TakeDamage function inside of the damage function
you probably saved too much memory in that function call
oh duh
Good ol stack overflow
ok i'm getting this error now : "[INFO] - [Tech Geek] Error in PreEntityTakeDamage call: C stack overflow"
peace plum
eyy plum
I'm back.
perfect nutshelling
welp
beautiful
http://gamewebcomic.com/comics/webcomic86.png AB+ in a nutshell
or atleast for all pickups and Tears. Which doesnt really make sense because the CollisionMass in entities is above 3 for both
for some reason
I think the Mass attibute of an Entity is always 0
ty Jean
has anyone made a custom entity ? i'm having trouble
its definitely needed for an api like this
probably
hmm. maybe I should make a mod base of sorts with table-based abstractions for items, characters etc.
<@266032468853915650> i did `player:GetFireDirection() not Direction.NO_DIRECTION` but it's not optimal
atleast `Game():ShakeScreen(20)` worked for me
oh
just `Game()`
uuh... how do i get acces to Game ?
yeah the play sound on player doesnt work for me at all
does EntityPlayer have something like isShooting?
Ocean Man ?
is To* fixed now? no longer a copy operation?
have I gone too far? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UON-lDrjYho&feature=youtu.be
player:ToNPC() didnt even work for me at first but wtf
but. Why tho?
i guess
dunno
not player
try to use another entity
player:ToNPC():PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_ISAAC_HURT_GRUNT, 100, 0, false, 1)
what the actual fuck
<@266032468853915650> I made one, but it doesn't have a select screen graphic or anything
post the playsound code you have pls
that doesnt even make sense
you what
if i comment out the playsound for getting hit i no longer die
seriously?
i'm serious
wat
kills me
playing the hurt sound
what the actual fuck
<@228680372215349249> are you the guy that made a character that works?
still a clusterfuck, I see
ehh...
not a single callback is for in the menu
highly doubt it
Do you know if there is any way to run code while in the menu?
thanks
cool. Then it seems to work now
only actual NPCs
HI <@162216634633814016>
```lua
    for i, e in ipairs(entities) do
        if e:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            e:ToNPC():PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_VAMP_GULP, 100, 120, false, 1)
```
because before the patch, playing sounds almost never worked with most entities
HELLO
I'm back!

any entity?
entity
whats e?
alright
`e:ToNPC():PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_VAMP_GULP, 100, 120, false, 1)` this is what i ended up doing
now I just need to find the ID for player hurt
ok i found the PlaySound thing
hold on i also messed with this sound shit today
that doesn't tell me how to play a sound
w8, i think he made a post about that. 2 sec
hacky but apperently worked
i think he went though all entities tried to do ToNpc with them, and if it didnt return nil he played a sound
how?
someone managed to do it
wait can you not play a sound
i can safely say that i missed a step somewere xD https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZtkN6jBOctqJq48/giphy.gif
i think you could somehow use ab+ mods folder for this too but that'd disable achievements so why bother
So the "professional mods" go into the other map
Yea?
oh if you're using that kind of mods that dont use .lua, yeah just drop it in resources lol
Thanks!
Cause my question is, why if I edit the items.xml (where i change yum heart to test for example), i don't see the items name changed in game (same with when i change the maxcharge). I do insert it correctly just like all other mods that DO work. (In the My Afterbirth+ mods directory, it DOES work in the /resources directory where i just insert the items.xml)
unfortunately I don't know the name of the hurt animation
What happens if you use player:PlayExtraAnimation("whatever the name of the hurt animation is")
i might just have to find a way to play the damage animation without actually calling the damage function
ab+ mods yeah
or in the resources directory in steamapps
Should you insert it in the My games map (The afterbirth + mods)
cause my mod deletes normal hp and replaces it with numerical hp
If you install a mod manually
Guys
ye
ah
doesnt the lost have half a soul heart at all times
not 0 hp
the lost has half a soul heart
a character that inherently can only have 0 hp
and also the lost
oh right devil deals yeah
It shouldn't, but neither should DAMAGE_FAKE
yeah
devil deals
is that even possible in rebirth
how does a player have 0 hp without dying
This function only runs on players with 0 hp
(if they died)
player:TakeDamage(0, DamageFlag.DAMAGE_NOKILL, dealer)  that wouldn't kill the player, right?
Hmmmm. Revive them afterwards?
nope :(
How about DAMAGE_NOKILL?
How would you take fake damage that wouldn't kill a character with 0 hp?
handle the frames
and on MC_POST_UPDATE
and set it to true with the cache flag
local hasItem = false
damagefake still kills me :(
that part works
ok so you want to create a variavble
the numbers need tweaking but it's supposed to give - yeah
luck over time
ah
no no that's how the item works
remove the frame count stuff
do i need to specify any flags or anything in the callback?
yeah i've got it set there
<@102194039104737280> As far as I know evaluate cache isn't run all the time. So each time your player gets a stat update you'll have a chance to get the luck ugrade.
<passive cache="damage"
lilith did you set the flags on items.xml?
Aight, I've got it
How would you do that flag?
Oh, there is?
<@72413153614368768> There's a damage flag for that (FAKE)
It'll be dealing a 0 damage hit
make sure it doesn't kill the lost
Wait, I think I've got an idea
How would you put Isaac in a damaged state without dealing damage to him?
having an issue with this code, luck resets whenever it's modified by any other source and i think i'm using MC_EVALUATE_CACHE wrong
```local holyPromise = RegisterMod( "holyPromise", 1);
local item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Holy Promise");
 
local luckBonus = 0.13
 
function holyPromise:item_effect( currentPlayer )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(item)==true then
        if(player.FrameCount % 50 == 0) then
            player.Luck = player.Luck + luckBonus
        end
    end
end

holyPromise:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE  , holyPromise.item_effect , EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER );
holyPromise:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE , holyPromise.item_effect );```
Until i added the second one and now, neither of them work
is here anyone who made cards?
Everything worked fine
When i added the first one
Ive just added a couple of passive items that add some stats to the player
Can anyone help me?
GUys
so prolly
i mean its would be counterintuitive to the point of mods and the established pixel aesthetic
35 no matter what I type in as damage
do you think making a high resolution, hand drawn graphic overhaul would be pointless
wtf addburn does ALWAYS the same amount of damage?
yeah ofc, its just bothering me xD
<@109624258317033472> Seriously, just ignore that and make it to a scale that other similar enemies have
<@174193097285173250> My Man!
i hated it doe
but i worked in games
to be a web dev
learning javascript atm
<@109624258317033472> it has something todo with Grids, Collisions and some Points
all this shit is over my head. im transitioning from animator/artist to programming
Has anyone figured out what GridCollisionPoints are in entities2.xml?
i mean shit it'd still be miles better than this i guess
and only the lua api would go public likely so
oic, thx flotilla
anyways, cya guys, good luck
<@257671069484318731> That's far over most people's heads anyways, if Kilburn decides to throw a bone to the modding community it'll be through releasing his API, not by documenting the means by which he made his API
no id in items? gg
woah
glhf
there's partial information on the xml here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QWFUn-zAunGcIGxeMlaxmVGFW4bhLVBpFbyZ3CGoOw0/edit#gid=0
dirty secrets
anyways, im gonna go
dank secrets
oic
dark secrets
no
has kilburn documented how he exe patched
even ab+ has id="x"
it matches the xml files in the game though
well it mostly does
that tutorial is 1 year old XD it doesnt apply 100%ly to ab+ ?
he most likely did posts on the other ones as well
for everyone trying to compare 2 entities. here's a tip don't do entity1 == entity2 but do entity1.index == entity2.index ..
yeah just items
oh this is just items.xml
but the ids and stuff dont work
ill just make a game in unity fuck it
i did a bit. yes <@229593818691928067>  of what files do you need one ?
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/3mub9c/ways_to_modify_items/?st=ixm5o2oh&sh=4363e404
im on the page right now actually
who knows
he did i think
gratz
wtf I did it
actually didn't Wofsauge do documentation on some of the .xml on /r/themoddingofisaac
^
and the official versions are worse lel
<@257671069484318731> the tools are cool and all, but alread existed before afterbirth, they just made the "official versions" , the real meat of modding is just the lua api(which still kinda sucks atm xD)
<@257671069484318731> People have to resort to hacky workarounds to do really basic things at the moment, which shouldn't be the case
but it looked shit
i've used spine, i saw there was a tool for animating
theres literally no documentation/examples regarding the .xml part so that sucks aswell
all i know is animation
and they need to expand on it for sure
please forgive me
ok sry portal
its the API that blows
alright stop saying "tools", the shitty tools are worthless and have nothing to do with this
hm
like "whoops sorry, this is how: X"
<@257671069484318731> Like portal is saying, the current state of the API doesn't make many people confident that future patches will make the situation much better
is it possible to expand on the tools
then again they managed to miss stats so
you'd think there would be feedback from the devs
how do you miss item pools of all things
like
http://i.imgur.com/ulwuK6E.gif
thats an incredible oversight
this api is messing with my mind
is there going to be continuous dev
whoops
you
So nobody has figured out itempools? Everybody on the workshop is like "TODO: figure out item pools"
whats everyone's assessment with nicalis and communicating on improvements/new additions to the api
yeah they added them now
emphasis on **were**
I thought stats were added last night?
poopypoo
why make so much shit read-only ffs
well there goes one idea
just like the stats were ?
yeah i think its read-only
i see `GetBackdropType()` but nothing to set it
how'd it look?
i hacked a way to change the floor a while back
you could always make new tiles and just place them over somehow
yea probs not
shheeeeeiiiiiit son
I feel like it would be loaded at the start of the game and wouldn't be able to change mid-game
during gameplay?.. i wonder
or is it a static asset
during gameplay
Well, I'm not saying it IS a new game, I'm just saying, if you wanted a new game, the closest you could get is pretending.(and even thats a stretch)
can you switch out tilesets
you can change shit but its still isaac
eh thats like calling godmode a new game
how'd that work
you enter a room and the ground is a NL vid, doors locked until it's over
i want to make Binding Of Isaac But Every Room Is a Northernlion Episode
I mean, you could probably make an extremely changed version of isaac and just treat it like a new game. But that's the closest you can probably get rn
no
can I make an endless runner
probably
yeah
Tyrone's definition of new game is probably "you can put an invincible larry jr in a room with doors that never open and see how long you can survive!"
i think they meant more like... gamemode
someone port that to isaac
can I make a zoomed out fight similar to witness
doesn't ygopro run on lua
"whole new game" is still exaggerating
D'oh, oops
allegedly this isn't the api's "final form" so maybe in the future
controller
we can't draw to the screen right ?
Input hooks were added last patch portal, weren't they
yeah go ahead make a new game in this
>no input hooks
WHAT
yeah thats just blatant bullshit
don't believe his lies
NO!?!
that we could make a whole game with the api
didn't tyrone say that exactly ?
no
no?!
no, carry on
hey fam, so whats the dealy deal with the modtools. can we make an entirely new game with the engine
has no one figured that out yet?
oh right item pools
you let the game do it automatically
Because itempools.xml needs an id, and I need my item in an item pool, I can't live with people needing to spawn my item in
...thats exactly why you WOULDNT assign the id yourself
probably so you  can add multiple items from multiple mods without conflicting IDs
now why do you want to assign an id to your item
Hey, for some reason I can't assign an id to my item in items.xml, the game just auto-picks its id as 512, anybody know why this happens?
bye
bye !
bye transit
have fun with ya lives
talk to y'all later
anywho i'm tired i'm gonna chainsmoke then go to sleep
it's the lua way lmao
player.HasCollectible(player, screwdriver_item) <=> player:HasCollectible(screwdriver_item)
Btw, KyoZM, just use player:HasCollectible(screwdriver_item)
only because ```--local isFlame = false
    --for i = 1, #FlameEntities do
    --   if FlameEntities[i] == source.Entity then
    --       isFlame = true
    --    end
    --end``` 
this doesn't work somehow
because that's the way to do it if you don't use `:` instead of `.`
intersting
oh I see
that's as close as ya gonna get Xbagon
why are you passing player to hascollectible
Mod.ent_info[entity].attribute
Any ideas where I should start with the Lua programming?
instead of going entity.attribute do this
why does this not work ```--[[Stats--]]
function itemExpansion:cache()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  
  if player.HasCollectible(player, screwdriver_item) then
    player.Damage = 1.5 + player.Damage
    print("[ItemExpansion] Screwdriver Cache Flag")
  end
  print("[ItemExpansion] Cache Flag")
end```
but whenever you need to access that attribute
Ok
but i need to give enitty a new attribute ?
thats a nicer workaround than using tons of local variables on top i guess
You can use anything as a key in lua
```test```
that's the kind of bs i've been pulling
just keep track of it internally lmao.
```
Mod.ent_info = {}
Mod.ent_info[entity] = {info = 5}
```
could they not have made some lua wrapper around it tho so it would work?
It doesn't work because they're technically C objects i believe or something like that
:d
fucking hate life
Keep it out of modding dude
ugh why isn't it working now
You shitpost everywhere you go, snowman?
AP?
I tried. input:5: attempt to index a nil value (local 'test')
but iirc that doesnt work with this api? didnt try myself tho
i think you're supposed to be able just do `e.attribute = "something"`
like in js?
just accesing it and writing something?
in lua
can i like add a attribute to entity?
^
can't base them on regular items ? like coins
CollisoinBody thing didnt work?
making them move is easy. making them persistent and move? very difficult
i'm not sure how i'd modify my mod to make that work properly so i just won't
that's illegal
except pushing the collectibles around
fuckin everything
but i've got persistence, resetting persistence per floor, handling restarts (need to test this real quick actually)
wins you the run
best item in isaac
if player.HasCollectible(player, screwdriver_item) then
    Game():End(0)
  end
lmao
Whoop! everything working other than y'know actually spawning or doing anything
? ty for looking
just tested right now
oh yes indeed its 6
sorry, i see nothin no idea
and it totally should be the same
I checked that source.entity.type is = FlameEntities[i].Type
becuase FlameEntities[i] == source.Entity doesn't work
I just know that isFlame is always false
tried going through it with the debugger?
```lua
function Xitems:damageTaken(entity,amount,flag,source,countdown)
    Isaac.DebugString(entity.Type)
    local isFlame = false
    for i = 1, #FlameEntities do
        if FlameEntities[i] == source.Entity then
            isFlame = true
        end
    end
    if isFlame then
        entity:AddBurn(source, 60, 3)
    end
end```
anyone an idea why this doesn'T work pls send help for <:isaac:257394072933761026>
so when i change the stats it goes back to the original value when i pick a stat up
ok
me have no ideaz
idk
and depths 2 is the 6th floor
since basement 1 would be 1
wouldn't it be 6
is it 5 or 4?
meaning i probably fucked it up
apparently mine it ends on flooded caves
thingy
in the  challenges
what is the level id for mom?
wait help me
ah, found em! thank you!
don't meme too hard
rebirth
im making a rival to the green isaac mod
YELLOW ISAAC
would be under enemies I assume
maws I think
dunno whats their name is
Do you guys know where the gfx of these gravity-stone-faces is?
just checked anyway bc why not
gotcha
another floor doesnt trigger player init
eyo
my b
i guess
lmao
probably something in Game
transit did you just break Green Isaac ?
wait, let me make sure going to a new floor doesn't trigger it
but how do you know the old seed
hmm
I'm gonna have it check for if the seed is different on player init i think
i just tested it too
lmao yeah continuing does
yeah continuing a run does trigger it
restarting certainly triggers it
I'm gonna test
hmm
or even restarting
after exiting
I mean upon Continuing a run
that's not
it doesnt print on my terminal every tick
yeah
Are you sure MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT doesn't happen on continue
you guys have your petty fun, pajeet's doing magic on the antibirth api
pajeet back at it again with his indian hacks
ooops
wronc callback
itemExpansion:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , itemExpansion.newRun)
https://gfycat.com/CreativeJampackedAmazontreeboa
itemExpansion:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, itemExpansion.check);
--[[New Run--]]
function itemExpansion:newRun( )
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  
  print("[ItemExpansion] New Run Detected!")
  hasDemonHeart = false
  hasHeretic = false
  hasReckoning = false
end
Since POST_PLAYER_INIT probably happens on continue too
no
I guess to detect a new run i should just get the seed and compare, yea?
green isaac will cure more cancer
tbh
yeah thbn
cool this will be great news for him
it will cure it
give him binning of isek
weird, my uncle still has lung cancer
it cured cancer
thank you for making such a great mod
yes
<@!173420370773147649> you the guy that made the binning of isac?
i'm still impressed that someone has made twitch subscriber integration
yeah i made it
best mod
online isaac
it's a good parody of the API limitations
best mod
green isaac
lol
hey <@266032468853915650> you're the creator of Green Isaac right ? i heard about your mod, super impressive stuff!
port antibirth to iosaac
i saw it so many times in game but i was convinced i knew what it was
port antibirth to linux
Replacing libraries
ok m'bois i'm back
Technically speaking, it's largely how Kilburn did it too, if the method is translated to how it would be done on Windows
10/10
damn it i wanted to do a portal gun mod... just learned about the Ventricle Razor
lmao
Because that's how you  do it on linux
i know many about computer too
thats how zatherz did it
what
LD_PRELOAD meme
and use LD_PRELOAD
build a library that replaces the SDL initializer, says "hello world" then runs the initializer.
and actually now that I think about it i could on linux tbh
If you gave me, like, an hour I might be able to, though, honestly
Learning assembly is one of the next things I'm planning to do, tho
Me? Nope. No clue. I don't know assembly and there's not a good linux disassembler anyway
Whether y'all believe it or not, he does know what he's doing with code and shit
i bet you cant hack into isaac to print "hello world" on startup
so
he knows how to be a piece of shit
I was still making the world's shittiest minecraft mods
he knows how to HACK isaac with RAW C
how old is zatherz
oh yes
He definitely knows more than I did when I was that age, tbh
microsoft loves linux
And Zatherz, no matter how much of a piece of shit scumbag he is, is actually brilliant with computers, especially for his age.
zatherz loves python
let's just replace giving functions names with randomly generated strings of numbers
why not have a simple constructor
this is amazing
You're telling me you have no interest in differentiating functions
yeah cause python programmers are children who normally call random functions
make it so no one would call it normally
the _s make it unobtrusive
then again i unironically love rust and it has some of the most cancerous syntax ever
no, no, explain what you'd prefer
look at literally any other language ever made
like the rest of python
What do you recommend for designating the class initializer?
`if __name__ == "__main__":` is also the ugliest thing ever
something as basic as classes should not need underscores like that
python is for scripting
^
you're not supposed to see underscores except if you're making classes
\_\_init__ is the initalizing class, *args is for a list of the additional arguments, **kwargs is a key value dictionary of the keyword arguments
looks like im looking at some obstructed c++ header
also the underscores are the actual worst
so theres that
i dont know how good it is but it looks disgusting
makes me think of pointers
fucking not using a weird ass `*`
what's the way you'd recommend, portal?
it makes literally NO sense
kwargs lmao
I think some of this convo should go into <#220581404612886528>
yeah? it is
uurbguh
i fucking hate python
so simple
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
`def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)`
love u guys
lmao
>people hating on python because it's easy to understand
phytonic way
pythonic way
and an embedded language like lua!
you can't argue that python is better than lua though
i'd rather write batch than python
because a lot of people hate doing things the "pythonic way" but that's actually good for a browser!
id much rather write js than python
especially for javascript-like applications of it
Phyton is by far my fav scripting language
but python is good as a scripting language
C# is best
ah hell yeah
i love Javascript personally
i am
c# is the best imo
y'all might jump down my throat for that
i fucking hate python
Has anyone ever explained it
Opinion: Python is cancer
Why *is* it ~=
Opinion: Python's design is what both Lua and Javascript should have
lol
.
wow
lmao
thats apparently why
Lua is descended from Sol, a language designed for petroleum engineers with no formal training in computer programming.
why would you ever subject yourself to it
js was made for hamsters that snort cocaine
im kinda happy i never messed with JS yet.
whyy
1 indexing is actual horseshit
wew
i didnt rememebr that
pm2k you only now figured out?
ewwwwwww
yes
lua is 1 indexed
lua starts at 1
wait what
yes
^
true: (1 == true), false: (1 === true)
which is pretty much the only thing yuo should ever use
it's an equal that doesn't autoconvert shit
stop typing slow you fuck
js has both == and ===
its equal
jer stop sniping me you fuck
no
wait. in JS === is "not equal" are you fucking kidding me?
1 indexed arrays
1 indexed arrays
=== or 1 indexed arrays
ok
no doubt
===
===
*rotating
not sure whats more stupid, javascripts `===` or luas `~=`
excuse me?
totating
totating in javascript is 100% seppuku
javascript was made by looking at several other languages and going "UH WHAT DO WE NEED"
and its one of the worst designs ever
lua was made with a sense of design at least
not denying that
like it's just badly made
hahahahaha
tru
>implying lua isnt an actual shit language
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>notepad++
javascript is an actual shit language
ugly piece of shit
Portal why is notepad++ a meme to you
nodeos best
who needs a file manager when i can navigate through the terminal faster tho...
nodeOS is also good if you can stand the fact that its javascript ;^)
lmao
i still use the file manager
atom's good if you can stand the fact that it's made in html
weirdo
but
i mean i3's great
like i like weird shit like that
Atom it is!
true
that's how
with no file manager
Because I know it makes me more efficient as a programmer
i don't know portal how is transit on i3 window manager
how did you have the patience to get used to vim then
Atom
Not vim, you'll hate it for like 2 months before it becomes comfortable
>instantaneous
>vim
>half a second
ATOM
ok guys, ill download a new editor now, Sublime Vim or Atom? what shall it be?
500 milliseconds is almost literally instantaneous, jer
please go
mine's instantaneous
>caring about open source
uh
that's
closed source text editing lmao
wow vim opens in 500 milliseconds for you
notepad opens very quick too.............................................................................
visual studio code Kreygasm
^
>>>>>>>>Sublime
yeah, and vim opens in like 500 milliseconds
atleast use sublime
>notepad++
<@96016391173332992> was just kiddin, everyone shall use what is good for em. ? Personally, i havent find anything that really suits me. Im probably Stuck with Notepad++ forever *sigh*
mine would be one second but i have extensions for days lol
y'all are great
lmao
>the most basic thing you do on a computer
xd
*sec
for me its like 1 sex
takes me like two seconds
>needing a good pc for text editing
get a better PC >.>
thats you
that's just you
it takes like 2 minutes to open
it's electron
i mean yeah
atom is the actual bloatiest text editor on the planet tbh
linux people are weird
i've been using it for configuration edits
also Scayze actually fight me I genuinely work best in it
atom is just so good
but vim good
sometimes
jerry still uses atom tbh
it is indeed a good config
Jer knows that my vim is of the highest quality because he uses my config
without assigning it to anything
ummmm im not sure that you can just write `local rng` and use it
I find myself closer to orgasm every indent
vim good
vim?!?! oh look we got a "cool" kid over there >->
2 spaces is pretty much the equivalent to the absolute territory
vim best
vim handles that for me
no
cant tell if thats ironic or not
you use it 2 times?
lol I mean I use the tab button
2 more like 2short
you can feel the love of god fill you up when you use 2 spaces
i dont enjoy mashing my spacebar
hail tabs!
tabs for live!
4 ;-;
2 spaces
Your opinion is incorrect
same
spaces are a meme tbh
i use tabs
ok thanks for the warning i'm coming to your house with a fucking gun
srsly
>not using ANY text editor that fucking makes it consistent
i warned you
i told you its horrible
i used both tabs and spaces in that
>tabs
who taught you to hate yourself, poor child
corresponding items.xml
https://hastebin.com/obujedeyik.xml
ok so now i just have to see if it fucking works
wew
i'm proud of y'all
I'm surprised no one's quoted 
```
if line == "NIPS"
```
yet tbh
warning
https://hastebin.com/jewuqutumo.lua
That's a nest I could lay my eggs in
END END END END END
it literally reads like fucking assembly
this is transit screaming for help
end end end end end
I feel like this loader was written in assembly lmao
oh my god what

  local table = nil
  local linehandler = nil
  local cur_room = nil

```
pm2k pls
Hmmm
iactually i dont wanna share it since it looks like serious ass
figured its frames
aka frames
one sec
wait
ticks i think
I havent figured out what unit they use for time yet
the all stats up
Yeah I suppose
pm2k do you still have code for that
that worked
well, you could either constantly apply charm or just apply it once with a huuuuuge number
i tried to make an all stats up and those two didnt work, but i got around range by changing tear height instead
neither does range
changing the player's firedelay doesnt seem to work
Can you charm them forever?
In unity*
Like instantiatebin unity
Thats pretty cool, thanks
local enemy = Isaac.Spawn(id, variant, subtype, position, velocity, parent)
enemy.AddCharmed(time)
Uh, you spawn an enemy and have a variable to reference it?
you can spawn an enemy and then charm it ?
im not too sure on how the cache shit works
Looking for the snippet/whatever you can use to spawn them
As for the rest, that's something else
Is there a mod that successfully spawned charmed enemies alreadym
Well, you can increase damage I think. I tried that and it worked
*magic*
<@160772316920414208> i'll answear if i can
show us more magic oh great videodrome
all we do is whine about no stats when they're clearly there
you're good man
nah you're smarter than everyone here
Videodrome wasn't that insulting
So can I still ask modding questions or am I forever in exile?
ok, stop this discussion
chill
also yeah it was rude and i stand by my words
guys
The idiot above who thought that this channel somehow glossed over the ability to alter some stats, despite it being added later
pm2k said firedelay doesnt work???
Because that was rude
Who are tou talking to portal ?
fuck
also doesnt damage need ummm
... oh
do me a favor and fuck off if all you're going to do is act snarky over something you're clueless about
I'm sorry for offending you
I tried doing an item that decreases firedelay and increases damage but it only does the latter
tell that to <@160772316920414208>
?
It didnt exist before
There been an updatz
Can you affect firedelay too?
Actually no one missed it
I even not started coding, but actually I guessed this can work that way
works for all stats!!!!!
everyone just missed it heh
it was that simple
nah its just player.Damage you genius
So right now editing stats only works for some of the stats?
but aight
i did too lmao
whew i'm gonna take a break before i write this data decoder
someone needs to call out fucks like that
that sounds like an accurate statement tbeh
lmao
could it be that you only show up when theres something to hate? <@162156525337575425>
Honestly speaking though I do swear like every other sentence
Ok
and i'll swear whenever i damn well want to, thank you very much
kindly fuck off
if you dont know what you're talking about
mate you were the one getting snarky
maybe you shouldnt be such a fucking moron
And then its just player.Damage
Stay classy reddit
Wow, everyone was butthurt about not being able to change stats\
Maybe you should not swear at someone for being unaware of something
our thing
sort of
it's
that's what we're about
yeah mate it's mod support
in <#205854782542315520> on "Modding of Isaac"
maybe you shouldnt be such a smug fuck when you have no idea what you're talking about
it's "just mod support"
ayy fuck off dude
aaaaand now you're backpedalling
No need to swear
Guys it's just mod support
and it doesnt even work for certain stats
lmaoo
it was added later you fucking moron
...because that got patched in afterwards
It saves to save.dat in the mod folder, Scayze
Stay classy reddit
And then its just player.Damage
no, that's with SaveModData
NIPS
Wow, everyone was butthurt about not being able to change stats
NIPS
was saveModData not sufficiant?
fuckers didn't tell us how long our strings could be lmao
if it works, it aint bad
save format
my beautiful
https://ptpb.pw/g4PS.dat
source is EntityRef
any idea why this doesn't work?
```local isFlame = false
    for i = 1, #FlameEntities do
        if FlameEntities[i] == source.Entity then
            isFlame = true
        end
    end```
fuck yooouuuuu
i could've done what i needed with a string.split but nooooo
oh fuck me with these lua patterns
any ideas?
entity:IsEnemy() doesn't seems to work
why
what
ugh I need to do smthing else then to make it work
mhm
and they are damaged?
spider mod
if you don*t deal damage
how can you see if you heal them?
Im alrdy at negative 1000
I just dont deal anything
nope
pls
does it heal enemies if u shoot them
ouch

omg I shouldnt have done that
This is just an idea of what i want to do
makes sense
oh ok
yea
```lua
if player:HasCollectible(prism_item) then
```
```LUA
function fuffles:passiveItems( currentPlayer )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    
    if player:HasCollectible(player, prism_item) == true then
        player.Damage = player.Damage - 1
    end
    
end

fuffles:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, fuffles.passiveItems, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER );```
what were you doing lmao
nvm
I might have fixed it now
1s
Can you show your code?
my code is broken then
ok
uhh
dont you have to call reevaluateStats or something
Just did that.
none worked
player.Damage = player.Damage - 1
player.Damage = player.Damage + -1
I tried
it doesnt register
Wow.
nope
So you can't do something like player.Damage = player.Damage - 2
they thought about adding, but not about lowering
this sucks, I cant lower isaacs stats
but doesn't work
k no syntax error anymore
throw it at someone
i dont like oranges. what do i do?
i just  found an ORANGE in my CLEMENTINES. unacceptable!
thanks
that too
entity.IsEnemy() -> entity:IsEnemy()
FailFish
should be entity:IsEnemy()
Kreygasm
dp
line 2
```lua
local isFlame = false
    if entity.IsEnemy() then
        for i = 1, #FlameEntities dp
            if FlameEntities[i] == source.Entity then
                isFlame = true
            end
        end
        if isFlame then
            entity:AddBurn(source.Entity, 60, 3)
        end
    end```
It seems to be a syntax error in here.. can you find it?
k
__mul
did you really used mul or * ?
wroked fine
i only used __mul and __add
you cant lower stats
interesting
hmm
Are all math operations posible with the Vector type? seems a bit buggy to me...
it looks like an USB or a Mouth refresher
<@229593818691928067>  thanks, i was able to spawn 47 different champion variants until the enemy became invisble. holy shit
make an item that sends you something IRL
<@109624258317033472> i meant champion 11
i wonder whats the cheapest thing you can have mailed to somebody
I'll have to improve sprite making I know
When I'll be able to start modding good (with better api so) here's an idea : http://puu.sh/tdd7b/45bc98d958.png

USB Key : Can  can store a rune/pill/trinket when you want too but don't have the item to store too. Hope it will be possible.
maybe like 10 people with the mod because 1 person would be way too bad
5 deliriums in the basement
there's actually 23 different champions ?
it keeps me up at night
lol
i hate that it's possible
and i hate it
no, that's possible
chat gets to choose the enemies that spawn
twitch integration with iasac
imagine a mod that gives a 1 time use spacebar item that gives a random person with the mod installed a passive item
but f u c k i t
it'd be a bitch
you could make an entity and direct it over the internet
omg
like literally fucking
the one that pulls you in is champion 41
or some shit
you could probably make an item that gives a random person who has the mod installed a coin
it'd just be horseshit to implement
well i guess i have to do that to find out.
although technically online multiplayer is possible I believe
the modding api supporting nearly as much as i'd hope? not so much
Scayze you can spawn them ingame with id.variant.subtype.champion
absolutely
the networking being possible bit?
what, there is no CHampionVariantEnum? is there a list of what is what?
<@96016391173332992> I'm completely illiterate, would you say anything in https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5ktagy/networking_seems_to_be_possible_in_afterbirth/ ended up being accurate in the end
yeah, I suck at using the console.
i guess that's a start, but it can be kind of a bit confusing for a newbie
eh
the little fucker
well the console kinda gives us the feaures from spidermod
so i'll just write a fucking save encoder myself
ok so json.encode hates me and my family
I mean the program for teh boi
i dont mean that thing
lol
there is alrdy an item that does that
uhm
i wonder if we will ever get a spidermod for ab+
is there table.contains(obj) in lua?
struggeled with that earlier that day ^^
wow, good to know, thanks Jean!
cool
it's that ez
oh really
is there a way to create an "magnetic" entity, like the champion variant?
<entity shutdoors="false"/>
i guess i can just make it not spawn unless the doors are open if i have to???
hahah
make my entity not keep doors closed
how the fuck do i
Well, since there's no way to hide hearts, I give the player 0 HP and turn every collected heart into the numeric HP system
idk
Or you could just... have numeric value based on the hearts numeric value?
And also letting you pick up infinite HP ups because of the way my item works
you have to go through every enemy and give them a damage value :p
yup
So it would literally just be cosmetic
hahahhahahahah
oh right
i love life
i'm trippin
Since if everything did 5 damage it would be just like having hearts
my collectible stops the doors from opening
LMAO
well why is the 5 damage a problem ?
ooh
Giving Isaac numbered HP
what is your item ?
So yeah, still pretty useless to make this item without giving every entity a seperate damage amount
Most things do 5.00 damage, it seems, then
<@72413153614368768> I just tested and my Globin did 8.25 damage.
again, felt like meat boy was just doing all the fighting
its the same but you have 1 cube of meat
with change notes now
just updated it one last time
that means my item's practically impossible to make without making an individual damage stat for every entity and every enemy projectile
oh ffs charmed enemies only ever do 5 damage
k ty
Yes.
just a space?
cache="speed damage" iirc
how do I set the cache to multiple thing in the xml like cache="speed"
Oh, also, I found a site that gave items effet idea but I can't find it anymore, anyone know what I'm talking about?
for example, currently we can't even add to the item pools
yeh i am in a run now
it should, yes
<@162795183845539841>  you have to do it too :p
Oh, it will improve for item creation? good
much less new ones
it's already unfriendly to experienced coders
wait until they've updated the api more, <@149079441908301824>
....I'll save on room completion, I guess
Hello, I want to launch myself in isaac modding but I've never really put my hand on coding so....
I've already some ideas but I don't even know how to find samples, or how to code effects. Can anyone give me a slight hand? ?
<@229593818691928067> see if you can go further now!
or saving of the data (because I don't know when's a good time for that tbh since I have to json.encode it and that's intensive)
hope y'all enjoy my mod :p
or spawning of the pickup
Good luck!
i still haven't added the effect to the active item lmao
I mean, I can't really blame them. The damage a charmed enemy does is a slightly obscure thing to need
one of which is a pickup
it's more needlessly complex now because I technically have added two entities
Flotilla sorta
Oh, I just realized why enemies have a collision damage stat. It's so that it actually hurts Isaac
I can't find anything about this and I don't want to do it hackishly
Ah, that makes sense
Is there any function which checks for a tear's collisionbox *overlapping* with another entity or object, even if they cannot collide? An example would be spectral tear vs. rock
<@72413153614368768> Familiar entities can do specific collision damage to enemies
you could also have put a changelog message at the top right in Moduploader gui
alright i know now
yus
oh it updated!
it worked ? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/836044481
the only thing that I've seen that has a different collision damage stat is the player's tears
More rooms, and change the chest ending music the Obstacles from life is strange
for tear delay you have to use CACHE_DAMAGE
why do entities even have a CollisionDamage stat if it's always 1
it says i uploaded the mod?
i found how to fix that
Not ab+
There are two mods I want to make for Ab
teardelay and range are broken lol
two}
<@195131617558265857> i think item pools yeah, not sure about floors
Did you try adding to passive items that change your stats_
<@195131617558265857> no because it isn't possible to do either
ok im gonna try now
Guys
yes <@162795183845539841>
tfw u have no idea how to make the game seek out the other color files
But yeah, I'm having trouble figuring out how to get the damage enemies do
i wonder, has anyone done like... " a new item pool " or a new " floor " yet?
like this?
<id>836044481</id>
ugh
giving isaac the enemy HP system
put it back at <id>836044481</id>
yeah
<@72413153614368768> so its practically health but replaced with numbers?
the id was at 0 then when you uploaded your mod it changed to <id>836044481</id>
do i just leave it 0?
ooh no
i changed it to 1
the old one was 0
yes
did you change the id in metadata ?
Something about a charge bar??
since as far as I know there isn't any way to get the damage a charmed enemy does
<@96016391173332992> I've already forgotten, but wasn't your mod only so complex for some very basic function that should've already been in the API
works fine so far other than picking up hearts under full HP and actually taking damage
this is the progress I have on my mod https://streamable.com/f8kro
i know i succ lmao.
haha
wut
i only have a reskin of lazarus and a new enemy (like 5 lines of code)...
nevermind touching the metadata
just launch moduploader, select your metadata.xml and Upload mod
#ignored
in modupload?
My mod is currently.... 165 lines of code
and add the updated metadata?
i just change the id
but i had an error
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/836008220
BTW TFW shitty shader mods https://gfycat.com/PartialUniqueHyrax
wut
let's see wof
<@162795183845539841> yes it's that simple
lmao what
my mod is pretty code heavy with ~800 lines of code, but only 50 lines of that are real code, the rest are arrays XD
ive been working on a new enemy/boss : )
I still just love how my axe Sprite fits in so well
Head's bugged atm
¯\_(?)_/¯
hrm, okay, how do i save on game close/exit so that it doesn't lag from json.encode too much
I mean its pretty neat but where da head tho
yeah more or less
that's pretty nice
so its practically a swingable moms knife?
https://gfycat.com/HarshBlankBarnowl
Don't know if you'd consider this something big, but here's what I've been working on
i'm making a mod that rewrites Isaac's damage function if he has a certain item
now I need to make this thing do things I wanna
and honestly i have no fuqqin clue how to make it... i mean i got the base done like the anm 2, its practically a non damaging idling enemy right now.
Yes, it works.
yup
If isaac gets hit
ugh
what do you mean?
<@162795183845539841> let me try
for Isaac?
y know im actually trying to create a boss
i can confirm
it does work
can anyone confirm the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback works
aah
just adds one fairly complex code-wise item
<@72413153614368768> something like an actual item that fits into binding of isaac... or maybe a new boss?
My mod is "big" code-wise, but fairly small content wise
thats what it says
bloat mode+ now with greedier green bloat mode
it's a work of art
isaac is green
error 9 file not found??
only the best mod
define "big"
alright now i've got it fixed
what's green isaac ?
i'm stupid
g od damnit
green isaac
uh... has anyone actually modded anything big yet?
no
without deleting the old mod one?
do modupload again with the metadata.xml that was updated after the first time you uploaded it
tfw it's good that an API doesn't work
New PRism Costume
so after all how do i update it?
since it stores positions and rooms
lmao
now that i think about it
and it's good it didn't actually because that would've fucked up my thing
no, collision class doesn't work
if it creates a new mod the previous one should still work ??
i cant even edit my tweet
but wouldnt the link i tweeted be broken?
just re-upload your aecx_challenge and see what happens
then what do i do?
<@162795183845539841> because you already had a folder it didn't download your mod
Nice job <@174193097285173250> !
idungetit
thy <@229593818691928067>  ?
i actually dont see the new subscribed folder
hey that's cool <@174193097285173250> !
update the files in the new folder?
finally am done with the costume
what do you guys think of this ? https://youtu.be/r5iplbRrhCg
id 1?
already subscribed to it
yep
well when you uploaded it it changed the <id> in metadata so i assume it updates it instead
that seems painfully annoying
<@162795183845539841> subscribe to your own and then update the files in the new folder and upload the metadata.xml from that folder
wouldnt it upload as a whole new mod tho?
wonder why you can't set that in the config. seems like a pain to do it in here
yep seems fair enough now
<@162795183845539841> i haven't tried but i think through the same process than uploading it
no problem ?
??
THANK YOU
TRUE
(which is probably why they aren't persistent)
wouldnt Entity.EntityCollisionClass work
how do i update it in workshop?
alight now that i updated it
only straight Entities
They aren't EntityPickups though
Yeah, they are
i'm gonna have his smaller version
nvm this made it so you can cheat and just let meat boy do it all
<@96016391173332992>
are those pickups also entities?
actually it'd be pretty easy
I'm in a callback from MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, but it appears I can't manipulate state attributes in it
but that day is not today
yeah rip one day i'm gonna make them pushable
but definitely more possible
not very easy
and you also start wth a super meat boy
the finger deals double the damage
Anyone succeeded in changing a state value?
cant push around nipples/10
alright i nerfed it quite a lot
how cool is that?! nice one transit
QUALITY
I would be the one that complains and is salty asf but I wont this time
literally shows a bug in her mod recording
https://ptpb.pw/emGQ.mp4

kinda
hi
Hi guys! new to this place hope you all modidng like beasts!
adding item rooms
this is why i'm nerfing
i'm not sure it's even possible
i guess i didnt expect it to be  99% impossible
i'm not doing any better
peace
hi btw
?
lolz
lol
trying to
right now im nerfing it
nope i cant even get past floor 1
hey <@162795183845539841> have you beat your own challenge?
noone could tell me if it triggers for all enemies or only for one
then I think on damage callback is better
yeah
we really need some kind of collision callback
if you want you could check the x and y variable to see if it's in the right square range before checking the vector distance
woops.
well how do you think it's done in the base engine?
entitties
but it works
that would probably require to loop trhough all entitties and will probably not perfrm very well
that's probably the least hacky it gets
just... check if their positions are close enough?
you require us to work with the API and not be hacky? thats a challenge ?
does anyone have an idea how to make enemies burn on contact with an entity? the less hackiest way possible pls ?
is it just as the previous one?
i dont see it with the numbers
wait what where is my mod
i read upload
update
o
subscribe to them and then choose the metdata in the new folder
yep
just through mod uploader i guess?
how does one update a mod
oh yeah how do you update mods in the workshop?
its too difficult, so i thought of making item rooms possible
i wanna update the mod
can i get some help again
i wanna get my asshole removed *personally* ?
too true
ur right
fuck
asshole always win
but if you remove it there is just a bigger one
because nips deserve love too Kappa
all I said was nip
why so defensive about nips, transit
sounds hot~
personally
one by one
i'm gonna remove all of your assholes
nipple
nip
nipple
fuck off they'll never see the name of the consumable, just that it looks like a tiny bottle of jack daniels lmao
nipple though
nip
try me
they're tiny bottles of alcohol
Huh, thats pretty cool!
google it fucker
but gives a permanent damage up on use
nip
only charges from these "nips"
a "Flask: Liquid Courage" item that introduces a "Rare drop" to enemies which is a nip of alcohol
the implementation issues aren't much of an issue
I mustve missed it haha
What were you actually working on?
but you get my point
since there's several visual issues from the implementation and i don't have spriting
well not looking
it's looking good
brb recording what i've got, guys
https://gfycat.com/UntimelyRealisticJunebug
you wanted to make a challenge right ?
Where should I start to create my mode?
can i see your code ? ?
Guys.
Just a lua script and animation file
¯\_(?)_/¯
screams
what happened
i mean what is the technology behind this axe
please?
i just misreplaced something
thank god
i'm a fool
pls
what. changed
<@229593818691928067> What do you mean?
now it's not persistent anymore
daaamnit
damnit
FUCK ME WHAT DID I CHANGE
2 sec xD
damn
upload to gfycat
wait. how do i embed videos?
<@!120669965236830208> how do you use the axe?
Credit to <@!188945290923868161>  for the sprite
Anyway that's f amazing.
Thanks ?
No idea why the head is missingi n the first place
Ah, that's just a glitch actually
But yeah, lookin good! ?
Yeah that's what I meant.
Yooo the axe looks amazing
cuz the head comes back when he is hit
I think he means isaac
If you want to re-sprite all the enemies sure
I mean you can repaint sprite, can you?
Is it possible to remove head when getting hit?
Nice.
holy shit that looks awesome
https://gfycat.com/HarshBlankBarnowl
The Axe
Behold
So many questions lmao.
And do I even need it?
So how I can enable debug mode?
oh shit edmund liked my tweet
Quick question, is there any way to run code while in the menu?
Should I create my mode from here?
Shit. Have some difficulties with english. Isn't my first language, sorry.
oh i mean the same thing i was working on the other day except now i made it so you don't pick up batteries with the thing
Wait. I can't figure out how to enable debug mode.
I just have to make this second thing persistent lmao
what'd you make transit
no please
i tweeted it
Yooooo guess who's got her shit mostly working
no
there we go
i guess i can add the mod thumbnail
Right?
So for now to do it properly `Isaac.GetPlayer(ply.Index)`
The player passed to the cache callback has an Index
Aecx, you might wanna add a screenshot tho
I just realised
guys
he might not respond but he's happy to see people making mods
idk its weird
nah its just that im kind of a shy person and all
xD
Well, that's automated, so yes :laughing:
why would you not? worst case he deosnt retweet?
<@162216634633814016> do you always enter a chatroom with that image? ?
should i?
idk
why would you not?

i dont think i should do this
Thanks man.
No. I only read the old ones.
<@85733051396526080> have you read this ? https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m092c/how_to_do_things_with_the_ab_api/
Do I need metadata if I'm the creater?
whats an easy app to capture small videos from the desktop?
cant find it
does anyone remember where the god damn sound playing function is
yep it works properly!
We need a character but it doesn't fire tears and instead has a trumpet familiar that fires music notes and every time he enters a new floor or a boss fight the john cena theme plays
awesome <@162795183845539841> ?
i'm gonna see if it works
well here it is
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836044481
~/.local/share/binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/ on linux
no you want the local mods i think
Should I create it?
All the mods are located in \workshop\content\***\***
The problem is there's no mods/ folder.
in your folder aftebirth+ mods/ make a new folder with the name of your mod
YAS IT WORKED
I mean change few tracks.
here's for the mod:
Also repaint one sprite and music as well
well that's simple enough
I want to create a single challange.
Make mods.
<@85733051396526080> make mods or install mods ?
make it <id>0</id> ?
I unpacked all the files.
1,0 or what
Where should I start?
do i have to change the id?
Or in another words.
How to install mod as a modder?
it helped me
this is copied from no pain no gain
I have another question.
yes
Hey folks.
oh actually you copied the metadata.xml from that other mod right ? the id is going to be wrong
if that doesn't work try restart steam
try to delete metadata.xml in your modfolder and run isaac again and then try again
Unknown errors are the best errors ^^

its right theree
weird huh?
i had to logged in in the webbrowser on the steam site to make it work
it's a black box their moduploader
gahh
well beyond that idk ?
yes
steam running?
you have the steam client running?
;-;
well that's not helpful ?
a card against humanity but instead of poops it spawns black hearts
but I cannot make chests spawn
I'm making a lottery card (sort of)
Failed to upload mod Pointy (2) - Unknown error
time to make a shitpost card
thank you for the help, I'll try that
it is in pocketitem.xml
what did it say <@162795183845539841>
lmao
no it's in pocketitems
help meh
oh
it failed to upload
and you need to use the pocketitem.xml
and make the card name description and shit in pocketitems.xml iirc
but I tihnk we have to add a cards.xml
pretty much a spacebar item but you use the card callback
seems bloddy simple
sure thing its possible
quick question: has anyone figured out wheter it's possible, and how to make custom cards?
every time i think ive heard the worst about this api it just surprises me again
i got use to typing luq,od
i knew there was a reason : didn't work
it has to be eng(US) and not eng(UK) if that helps
lol
they hardcoded the letters
brilliant
maybe if i change it before launching the game idk
no
LOL it doesn't even use the layout you've got?
on linux
that doesn't even work for me haha
im sick of changing my keyboard layout everytime
no. but let e know if you find out
does anyone know how to change the keyboard locale for the in-game console ?
now the correct familiar code and my old one mixes up and i get a new familiar every room. hoorey
my first ever mod :p
and the mod should be ready!
alright i just gotta add an image
then mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE , callback, variant)
thank you
god fucking damnit, that sounds logical
for familiars yup
that makes sense
ohhhhh! all ids have to be 3?
then when you Isaac.spawn it it stays forever
i made a new entity of id=3, that's familiar
it should be done like on_npc_update, yes? no experience with it meself tho
Scayze i sort of did
oh i see
Has anyone gotton custom Familiars to work? i just got it the hacky way without the mod callbacks of familiars
it's not healthy for the soul
don't go there
is there a BOI discord ?
fair enough
oh
nope, still didn't work
you can either change the metadata.xml or change the name and all in the moduploader gui
just change it in main.lua mate
I think I'm dumb, I accidentally called "main.lua" as "Main.lua"
lmao
and all that..
its called no pain no gain..
but
something like that
right?
and just when it changes handle the new ones
will one entity go away and 1 appear at the same time? i hope not
or just a number
wait
keep a list of entities in the room
solution
oh
hahaha
lol, the game chugs by default on my shittop
sublimetext3
i just use a text editor
you loop through them anyway and when the game starts chugging find a better solution
what program is everyone using to mod the game?
then select your metadata.xml in your mod's folder and the rest should be self-explanatory
you have to launch Tools/ModUploader/moduploader
how should i do this
damnit
It's gonna cost *way* too much to loop through all of the entities in a room on_update
how do i make it a mod in workshop
now
great :p
oh shit it worked on  no pain no gain
quality mod
pls
saying BAD
it sends nicalis an email
and instead of printing bad
release this as a mod
classic conditioning Kappa
and in red text
I'm just gonna print "BAD" in all caps every time you walk near a battery
maybe its because i should delete the middle stuff
hm
h
but not the coolest to implement
it is, but it's ugly :c
pretty much the easiest work around
because it's a massive goddamn pain in the ass
<@162795183845539841> in your mod folder, make sure there's no update.it ??
i might just spit a battery back out when you pick one up or something at this point
because they're just wasted
you should be able to just edit with notepad or something <@162795183845539841>
i'm trying to make it not pick up batteries right now
holy shit transit
great api
ain't it beautiful :p
yes
you had to code a whole new charge system
is that
i
the nopain no gain .xml just opens up an internet explorer page
https://ptpb.pw/tHqS.lua/lua
wait how
gib code
also, <@66197463593136128> check out my code now it's a shithole and actually from hell, probably TM
all i did is this: aecx_challenge/content/challenges.xml where i put your xml
but there are 100000 tutorials that can teach you better than us jackoffs
im gonna try it too
<@162795183845539841> i tried too and it shows up in custom challenges
but this is not a good place to start
no offense at all
yeah the docs are messing experienced coders up
Like no offense intended
Google it mate
Also is there a way I can get all batteries in a room on_update or whatever without iterating through all the entities because I find that to be an absolute sin
where do I got to learn lua code?
so i would assume your files aren't set up properly
<@162795183845539841> I just copy pasted your challenge into the No Pain, No Gain challenge mod and it worked
but that's enough to make basic lua mods
they don't give you any tools on mac besides the unpacker

transit's on linux and she's modding like crazy

wait WHAAAAA?!? I can mod on mac???
oh boy reskins
lol
Erm, yes you can JR_1414
its just *so easy to use*
i got my custom challenge to work by just not putting an id tag  <@162795183845539841>
the api is hard to use??? remember this guys!!! http://i.imgur.com/XPYNGJf.png
mac, can't mod on this thing
you've only got console?
I might get into it once I get a windows
tyrone
it's just that the api is horrible
asshole
eat my fucking
not really
oh fuck me i'll have to fake persistence with this as well
wow, it must be pretty difficult to mod the game o_O
wll yeah i looked at them
<@162795183845539841> someone made challenge mods already IIRC so you could look at how they did it
the closest we've gotten is adding a new slot on the character menu
but the docs are so bad nobody has 100% figured it out yet
it should be possible
i'll try
<@135254843567767552> so I'll use hot boms ty
I got a quick question about modding, is it possible to make completely new characters with the tools that afterbirth supplies?
yes
remove the id=0 thing completely?
you go to custom challenge list
and press tab
if you go to challenges
no i mean
just remove the id tag
oh is there a different list ? isn't it content/challenges.xml
if my custom challenge list is blank
not in challenges
that's the id of an already existing challenge
its in custom challenge list
yeah but it doesnt matter does it
<challenge name="Pointy" id="1"
what id?
yeah it doesn't work with several
last one in ab+ is 35 so 36 or more
of only all of them could be shot at once
try changing the id
it doesnt do anything :p
but not on custom challenge list
it appears on my mod list
yeah
https://hastebin.com/lorazululi.xml
 guys can anyone help me if i did something wrong in making this custom challenge?
cool :p sorry i can't help with your  challenge
nice, i'll keep it!
what do you think ?
neat !
it works perfectly
yeah i just did that
thanks <@162795183845539841> ! you can give yourself a dagger in the console with "g c172" ?
shoot me

i was just curious if standing still would make things not be able to hit you because they got knockback from hitting the fire
uhm I guess the fire but why does that matter? they won't die so fast
do they hit the fire or you first?
like zombies and stuff that run at you 100% of the time
<@135254843567767552> chasers? ?
or just one
is it for every entity?
I could use MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
Recommended from that a minecraft mod video by me xD
lol just do what I do check the positions and burn anything that touches them haha
wat
can you stand still and have chasers just get hit and bounce off you?
excuse me?
>Recommended from that: "Girlfriend's REVENGE - Pepper Sprayed Toilet Paper in Butt PRANK"
if they're smaller you won't hit anything xD
I need the burn and then it's okay
very weak atm
they deal 5 damage
and I need to add the burnig effect to hit enemies somehow
you should scale them down a little for balance purposes though, if you can
name's gonna change though
ahaha that's cute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1slaRTYd464&feature=youtu.be
yes
you're just spawning a flame entity or something?
let me open this stuff up and mess around
I'll try the collision class first i guess
hm
didn't do anything
I did this flame.EntityCollisionClass = EntityCollisionClass.ENTCOLL_ENEMIES
i haven't tested any of this stuff i'm just reading the doco
can you not use EntityiCollisionClass?
flames still block tears FeelsBadMan
<:isaac:257394072933761026>
I need help with collision
XBagon
lol
thanks ilise you're brilliant. now to see if it causes visual problems
DID I HEAR COLLISION?
but
i'd use ON_NPC_UPDATE, rather
well
if you're not, search for the other ones and replace them with batteries
if you're holding flask
and replace them
check for batteries
on update
that looks exactly like batteries
create a custom entity
can you use EntityCollisionClass to make it not collide?
....That's an exceptionally good idea, actually
here's an exceptionally silly idea: when holding the item replace all batteries you find with another entity that doesn't do much and if you don't have the item replace those entities with batteries again? it's terrible!
unless we can magically draw sprites to the screen now
i'm not just gonna write "charged" on the screen
Yeah, but then how do people know when it's charged :s
Make it zero charge. Implement your custom charge tracker
one sec
Wait, I might be onto something
damnit
haha
I'm gonna make it a variant and see if it still picks up
i'm working on that bit :p
fucking with them is harder, yeah
but i don't know what you would do to them
easy enough to find all battery entities
Ooor! Can I somehow get the battery entities and fuck with them?
worth a shot
i mean
haha
i wonder if i could charge the item before the battery pickup part, then discharge it after
i wonder when the battery pickup time is in the game loop
that wouldn't work if it was in a corner
i was thinking have it push them away if you got close enough, but
uugh how can i possibly make this not just *eat* batteries
so i'd have to add that i guess
That's a better idea than mine
Although that doesn't take into account special items
That would work
Also, I might make a mod that just whenever an item pedestal pops up, it gets all items in that pool + any custom items registered through the mod, randomizes, then replaces the item
maybe a good temporary work around for mod makers is a custom item room mod that we can all check if the player is in to spawn an item there
You'll probably get at least 1 a floor, typically
Also, you think, Dr. Alto? Good chance for multiple damage ups throughout the run?
that's actually a pretty decent idea
300 maybe
Yeah I thought about that. Give it like 1/500 chance
That's crazy that we can't even do that
I'm thinking i'll have my mod randomly replace other items in item rooms with it :p
seems like people would only take it if they dont have any other active items
i don't believe so
also no, <@175809793196294144>
i'm not sure yet
I might make them not drop if you don't have it, honestly
o
Only when holding the item
or could you get them before having the item
would you only be able to collect the nips of alcohol when you have the item
Damage up it is, then!
Fair enough
or carrying a bottle of pills instead
Has anyone figured out how to add items to item pools dynamically yet?
in fact if it's not straight damage it doesn't seem any more effective than hoping for pill drops
damage would make it significantly more worth taking for sure, or even dps in general
I'm still not sure whether to do a random stat up or straight up damage up
and if your luck is bad then it's just eating up space as your active item
but you're betting on being able to get at least a couple if you take it
that's an interesting concept
nothing too special
It's a rare drop from killing enemies
how do you earn the collectible?
The collectible is nips of alcohol :p
Flask
Liquid Courage
hmmm that's neat
i'm making an item that only charges with a custom rare collectible but gives permanent stat ups when you use it
what are you working on anyway?
only thing I need to do now is make it not eat batteries
ugh
thank you for pointing out my stupid error, seriously
hahhaha brilliant
register it before i delete it lmao
i just need to reverse the order of this bit
there's going to be so much pointless function calling
oh i'm an idiot
it'll be nice when people can update their mods working these hacky ways out for the proper ones
it's mostly working out
i'm hacking this shit in as well as i can figure :p
yeah i get you
maybe in a few weeks i can make stuff i want to
i'm just watching new informationg come in since the ideas i have seem still far off with the api
they didn't make adding a custom collectible easy
it's a bitch of a mod
impressive work so far for being blind though
damn i never knew i was actually blind
no problem
thank you
there's still an update after i remove it where it gets removed that frame
i'm so dumb
you're right.
oh god damnit
i am, yes
am i blind
one second
quick question, are you perhaps not starting at table index 1?
wait what
https://ptpb.pw/d8dK.lua/lua
that looks like you removed the first one, readded it, then you checked the table again
```[INFO] - Lua Debug: [{"y":280.0,"x":280.0},{"y":280.0,"x":360.0}]

```
```
[INFO] - Lua Debug: nip registered at (320.0, 320.0)
```
, no it didn't re-add, because when they're added it says this
it looks less like they're still there than they were readded. shouldn't they print in the same order? maybe you're not accessing the same table?
am i a fool
wait
uuugh
it's still fucking there
but then i re-enter and ```
[INFO] - Lua Debug: [{"y":280.0,"x":360.0},{"y":280.0,"x":280.0}]
[INFO] - Lua Debug: spawn

when i pick it up
this is removing  `{"y":280.0,"x":280.0}`
because look

it isn't
am I an idiot?? am i missing something??
everything kinda looks fine to me
fuck
the
what
with the before and after
the ones up top with two in a row is when i explicitly call table.remove on the table
the ones with spawn after them are when it's reading from the table to spawn them into the room
it is

depends if it's a table you made or not
why the actual hell does this value still exist in the table when i explicitly remove it AND PRINT THE TABLE WITH IT REMOVED
ok what the actual fuck
tired of pointlessly deleting a pointlessly added file
i just revoked write access to the folder while testing
sometimes mods just turn old for no reason
yea whats up with that
in my case apparently it added update.it while i was testing it with luamod
the collision sucks though
I did it speed up works
i know
cant seem to find a way to get firedelay to work though
while player.Range doesnt work, changing tear height does the trick
it does it on a syntax error too
g o d d a m n i t
fuck you
my mod didn't suddenly turn old
nononono
oh this fucker
wtf, so my speed up from my item does only work after exiting and continuing the run
Yeah I think they aren't updated yet
i couldn't say. i use my local copy
that might be why i cant find them
hmm
Also, if you're looking on the site the docs might not be updated?
it's in public attributes or whatever it's called
it's not a function
Going to look again
ty
Didnt find them there
Hmm
oh
In EntityPlayer
But where exactly xD
in the lua docs?
Or at least where are they written?
lmao calling json.encode on the wrong object has made my game stall hard
and those?
.Damage
like
GUys do you know the classes fro the stats of the player?
should work
oh. Well havent tried that but you can set the anm2 file to an entity, and with GetSprite() you get a ton of animation functions
I did
i mean like, triggerable with code
<@129475107583295488> yeah
anybody successfully implemented a custom animation yet?
ok
<@195131617558265857> yea
hm :/
should i like, pm some pictures so you can get a better picture of the problem <@109624258317033472>
<@120355885615808512> havent tried it myself yet, dunno. dont know whats wrong ?
spawning 1500 crashes my game.
strange...
trying 1500
<@109624258317033472> ```            flame.EntityCollisionClass = EntityCollisionClass.ENTCOLL_ENEMIES```
I did this still catches my tears
1000.1 and above are kinda for bombs.
k then ^^
yeah uh, i need to put it higher
check the log file for errors
because i just realized spawn 1000 shows alot of bomb stuff.
<@195131617558265857> is the mod marked OLD ? does your xml have the correct name? dunno
i might try 1500.
It isnt appearing when i write "spawn stonewalker"
Uh... Doesn't seem to work...
hi, well, can someone help me finding where I messed up with a code?
Thanks by the way
how cool is that? Was probably a bug, before te last upodate i couldnt get it to work ? lemme try too
Just a typo
Yep
<@175809793196294144> have you gotten sounds to work?
If this works i owe you big time.
Alright.
everything above 1000 or so is definetly free, some ID ranges beneath are too, but i wouldnt bet on it
dunno. Might work, might not
Should have been enemy:ToNPC() rather than entity:ToNPC
Oh. So i should'nt make it something like 600?
Well what do you know its because of a typo
take something above 1000, everything below is probably already used by the game
Let me try that.
...Oh.
yeah
you mean in the id="(numbers)", in the entities2.xml file?
something very high atleast
have you given it an unique ID?
If anyones willing to help i'll be happy.
Appareantly i cant get it to show up when i do "spawn stonewalker" into the console menu thing.
np <:isaac_happy:231218439778336768>
THANKS
Hello everybody? I came here to ask about my uh... my enemy that i am making...
public attirbute of entities
EnityCollisionClass it is
there are some collision enums
yeah
any idea?
noooo fire blocks tears not only enemies' but also mine
I'll have a look. Will need to run a game quickly because I had the code commented
Has anyone gotten the custom failiar callbacks to work?
What's the error in log.txt?
Yep
Is your entity an NPC?
I currently have : entity:ToNPC():PlaySound(SoundEffect.SOUND_PENNYPICKUP, 1.0, 0, false, 1.0)
I have found the EntityNPC.PlaySound method but I think it doesn't work because my NPC is dead
What was the function again?
I know it's in the docs, I'm looking ATM
Just the penny coin drop. I'm having trouble getting the call I have found to work
Have you read the API docs?
Built in sound
<@175809793196294144> Do you want one of the built-in sounds or a custom one?
in entityeffect is no function for that
true..
Hi, nice to meet you all! Does anyone know how to play a sound effect on demand?
so some creep slows things that walk on it, so you might be able to change the slow effect to burn
yes I set the collision damage
what kind of pickup? <@96016391173332992>
nice
there's collision damage
<@252687592024309761> so what could I do with player creep?
on room leave and return
I made my custom pickups persistent
what did you get to work? ?
sweet god
I'm jesus
GOT IT WORKING
no, not in the mod callbacks, i  thought i seen something in the docs
then it would work
or all
is it for a specific entity
no
but
I could use
MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
isnt there some collision callback which you can check for?
yes
maybe I can achieve that somehow
cause it's an entity effect, right?
no idea
is it being treated as player creep?
do I have to check every enemy if it was hit by my flame?
any ideas?
oh god.. what if I want to addburn to enemies that walked through my flame
spawn coins near your player with velocity away from him
and spawn some coins
check coin count, decrement and spawn a coin on the ground
well, reduce the amount of coins the player has
any thoughts on how to drop coins like when you get hit by greed?
is is cool shit
is it the collision damage?
but it does WAAAY too much damage
It works yay
thanks <@135254843567767552>
^
I think
everytime it's not 0
oh i know
it spawns less
so what it's doing then
right
FailFish
`if Isaac.GetFrameCount() % 10  == 0 then`
```if Isaac.GetFrameCount() % 10 then```
what's your spawn condition look like
that's more than 10 xD
cannot be though
a new flame is spawned
every 10 frames
frame*
what ?
are you spawning them all in a single flame, and then spawning again on top of them?
shouldn't there be like 2 flames?
How does this make sense if I spawn every 10 frames and they have a lifetime of 20 frames.. wtf?
player.Range and player.MaxFireDelay seem to be broken
ok does work yay
It is FrameCount indeed
greater problem is that I cannot add speed ?
I think I fixed it
I made another mistake
I would not be surprised there is a way to get the lifespan of an entity, but looking at the doc, I don't see one
You could get a function called every game tick and keep track fo the lifespan in that function.
do we have to use 2 for the API number in RegisterMod ?
let's test it
am i missing something in my implementation, here? probably
I just add poison and then the flame dies Kappa
fupcruckle
ye
i guess
Also if no subtype, just put 0?
<@77068961144909824>
I try to remove every flame that's longer alive than 50 frames
ok
you can just use the player
my custom pickup
what entity spawned the first entity
what do you spawn?
or does it need one
what if there's not a guy that spawned it, <@120355885615808512>
have i fucked something up here
I know that but that's not what I want atm
https://hastebin.com/anafayozum.xml
<@77068961144909824>
yes
the guy spawned it
With modulo
The doc says it is a way to get something worky every X frames
guys what is "Entity Spawner" in Isaac.Spawn again?
seems like framecount is the global framecount?
worked perfectly Kappa
lol jk

pretty damn, im using it to spawn a familiar at the start of every room
You're 100% sure that's a unique identifier?
<@96016391173332992> GetSpawnSeed
i'm gonna lose my goddamn mind
please god tell me i can uniquely identify a room in a way that can be converted to a string
mostly in terms of the selection screen not breaking horribly
<@120355885615808512> isnt Entity.FrameCount what you are looking for?
has there been any update regarding custom characters?
shrug
or get the lifetime of an entity?
any ideas how to set a lifetime then?
If something's broken, say it's broken, don't break it even more and say it works fine
For the sake of you, your modding and the whole community
I guess
ooh.
I mean I have a very similar line of code in one of my mods and it works without it
You'd be applying the stats in the wrong place, causing them to possibly get overwritten or applied twice
That'd be stupid
No, don't get rid of it
<@120355885615808512> try getting rid of the CacheFlag check
```lua
    -- Callback is a method that takes (EntityPlayer, CacheFlag). 
    -- Called one or more times when a player's stats must be re-evaluated, such as after picking up an item, using certain pills, manually calling EvaluateItems on EntityPlayer. 
    -- Use this to let custom items change the player's stats, familiars, flying, weapons, etc.
    -- Items tell the game which stats they affect using cache values in items.xml. Then the callback should respond to the CacheFlag by setting the corresponding player stat.
    -- Other items' stat modifiers, multipliers, etc are applied before this callback is called.```
Check the enums.lua after update
well, the way the game works is it only updates stats when an item "caches" the stat
what a life
what IS the cache update callback anyway
lmao
what
yeah
But if you try to set it outside the callback (it explicitely tells you to set it inside the callback) it works
inside the cache update callback?
well, what else is new in API town
For me it says that the field doesn't exist if setting it inside the callback
Yeah, the thing is
i'll just have to hack it
i need that as well for myself
```function Xitems:cacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(HotShoes_item) then
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
            player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 0.5
        end 
    end
end```any other ideas?
I don't believe so, zeta, sadly
any idea if it's possible to save any amount of data to the player? like just persisting data for a suspended run
we can edit stats.. not working for me though LUUL
We can mod stats
i wasn't
the api's been updated, scayze, unless you were there for that
because i need that
is there a unique identifier for rooms on a floor
well, `room=x+y,` might actually work lmao
Good morning anyone! What did i miss? did we find out something new? ^^
with just "="
use key value pairs Kappa
but i guess i can skip it for now
although i still want to store it in as small amount of space as possible because i'm weird like that
Kreygasm
oh nice
thank god
thanks zeta
i forgot the check
json library is included! thank god
i mean i guess you can
so can you make Configs with this <@96016391173332992> ?
json library included with the game
because each instance needs the room, the x coordinate, and the y coordinate
so i'm figuring out in my head how i'm gonna store this
it's easy to convert a table to a string but not as easy to convert it back
and i need it to stick around on continue
lel
is i'm gonna store all of the floors instances of my custom drop in a table
oh, okay, so the thing i'm doing that needs more than a string
use some xml interpreter and you have everything you need
but oh well, just convert whatever data you need to a string and convert it back out if you're hardcore
what do you need more than a string?
i wish you could save more than a string
nice
ok so Mod:SaveData and Mod:LoadData are useful as fuck
pls
I wanna make my enemies faster
why the fuck are the stats only in player
where speed_up is what you change it by
player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + speed_up;
yeah
so just the other thing is movespeed?
is correct
CACHE_SPEED = 16
basically you have like the shot speed and movespeed and all the other kinds of speed
too lazy to look into the doc
LUUL
thanks
movespeed
no clue, xbagon
can't use speed
anything we can turn into a strng can be saved
any ideas why that doesn't work?
good info
ok, so that's persistent even through different runs
```function Xitems:cacheUpdate(player, cacheFlag)
    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasCollectible(HotShoes_item) then
        if cacheFlag == CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
            player.Speed = player.Speed + 0.5
        end
    end
end```
or maybe trial blaze
speed up doesn't worlk though
burning feet
i'm gonna see if that's persistent only in a run file or if that's persistent between runs
It's an item called hot shoes
fire snake
make that a mod
ok. so mod:SaveData will save a string
lifespan is a public attribute, so that might help
omg it looks awesome
like damage and duration
wondering thought, how I could change the stats of the flame
neat trick
it shows the numbers
just spawned a Red flame in console
found it
ENTITY_EFFECT
Look at the doc, go in the enumeration page, and ctrl-f "effect" and "fire" or "flame"
uhm yea and what entity ?
It is an effect, so you gotta give it the flag for an effect entity, and then the flag for the fire effect.
and I crashed the game LUUL
yes
you literally mean the flame
oh
know anything, kube?
when I spawn fireplace in debug mode it gives the fireplace and the flame spawns
1000.52
hot bombs
fire mind
like red candle
flame
I'm confused
a fire
what do you want then?
don't want a fireplace though
its too huge to copy paste
<@120355885615808512> ENTITY_FIREPLACE
its all weird stuff
Documents/My Games/blahblahAfterbirth+ (not mods)/log.txt
entity_fireplace
what log.txt
but on custom challenges list its nothing
Nothing in your log.txt?
my challenge mod is in mods list and its enabled
yes
<@162795183845539841> You're looking at custom challenges, right?
what entity_type is that though
like red candle
no fire place
I want to spawn it
<@120355885615808512> like you want it to apply to tears, or you want a "fire place"
there's RED_CANDLE_FLAME under EffectVariants
or hot bombs
pointy still not appearing in challenges <:isaac:257394072933761026>
like from fire mind
Hm?
im still confused
does anyone have an idea how to spawn a fire?
Actually, it's "Fart Boy"
Got it. Thank you.
<@85733051396526080> download "Farting Boy" from the workshop (It is made by Niccalis), and look at how it works.
? you
tell the kid how to make a challenge
erm, Ghenza
idk. not my thing. ask someone else, sorry
<@96016391173332992> Is it? Ok, but how can I create a challenge?
every time i enter the game ?
I guess i will have to delete it
so
over and over again
It happens the same thing
When i run the game again
but
It seems it fixes it
ive just done that
<@132627275307810817> try deleting the update.it? mine are always blank, and it seems to fix the problem
or maybe both
or its because the game just updateed
the mod may be updating
D:
It doesnt work
wtf
Just woke up and the game says my mod is old
still havent found  a way to fix my challenge
Hey
yes
challenge, yes, but apparently it won't be compatible with any other mods, at least for right now
Is it possible to add an custom seed or atleast challenge with new modding tools?
I have a question.
hello folks
for things they need to add
also, wonder if nicalis is like lurking here and checking out what we're saying
for what purpose
Guess I'll have to test
https://gfycat.com/PartialUniqueHyrax
there's no description for them so i can't say for sure.
but idk
I'd guess it has to do with Mod.SaveData and Mod.LoadData
do we know anything about that?
The thing I'm more concerned about right now is how to save mod data so my mod is "Continue" friendly
not sure
Oh crap that might happen on continue too, though <@252687592024309761>
i'm not sure if that happens every floor or just the first
might have to check if floor is FLOOR1_1, though
that's a thing
right
nah, you're looking for "MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT" probably or something like that
so I'm looking for a way to say "hey the game reset. go back to your original value"
like right now I have a variable that I am persisting through several callbacks, but doesn't get reset every game. I have to manually do that
basically something to say you've started a new game
why would it, zxxv?
so that seems like you have to check if you already set it
nah it was just when you said that I was like "wait what" because I knew i saw it
Anyone know if STAGE_NULL  in the Level stage enum be used to reset variables local to the mod?
haha
FeelsBadMan
ye sorry
maybe that's new
but that's not a getter m8
if it doesn't work that's one thing
?

its like the isaac boss
someone posted a mod on twitter "gives flying" and isaac was juts standing on the ground with wings xD
1 sec
i just saw it
what
^^
only getter
We can't?
also we still cannot set flying..
They also have to add more callbacks... this workarounds are shit and the MC_USE_CARD isn't even working properly
yea I'll need to do that too
Fair enough. I'll check it out, but also it might be a bit different with manually adding cache flags so i'll see
I have no idea I'm just gonna read this https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mbwj6/editing_stats_with_ab_modding/
So, internally, um. You have to have a variable that holds whether the cache for that specific item has been updated yet? so you don't add damage every time the cache is evaluated? or
2 things I'm still missing. Freakin itempools and how to make tarot cards working..
sorry, i'm working this out in my head.
......
or do i have to delete the whole challenge format
https://hastebin.com/ugobavexeq.xml
wait but
animation*
AddCacheFlags()
just need the enimation
i guess
oh
I'm super happy with the axe effect right now
Also, how does one only change player stats in MC_EVALUATE_CACHE if you want to change them on spacebar item usage
you are the one who made the no hurry challenge?
oh wait
My mods kept working without changing it
do i have to change the version number in RegisterMod?
which i'm here for
well the api is like, moderately usable now
so that means i should have done everthing right
oh
No, the numebrs means you downloaded them from the workshop, yours don't need to have numbers on it.
cause all the other mods are like thehidingofisaac_[numbers]
oh yea the comment does toatally make sense
?
doesnt have _randomnumbers
is it because the pointy folder in mods
Here it mine https://hastebin.com/yejanasore.xml
in the xml
i thought i did someting wrong
Well, that's pretty strange, because that looks exactly like mine.
no, i meant what does the comment mean
https://hastebin.com/elamihusaf.xml
@transit you sent a picture of the Isaac.Spawn method and I said it's pretty simple and easy to understand
Just to not spam chat with walls of text
hmm, please use something like hastebin.com and then link it
i have no idea if i did it right

blindfold and no item rooms
trying to make a challenge only with the finger
what bagon
alright
Show me your challenge.xml file

<@96016391173332992>
hmm, I don't know, maybe it works exactly like the debug console command `spawn`

it's very easy
still didnt work
what I used this like 10 times
nicalis pls
what does this even mean

Well, the code with self explanatory name is kinda pointless to comment
hm okay
#selfdocumentingcode
Hmm, I got my challenge name displaied alongside other challenge names in the custom challenge menu. Now, I didn't test them, but mine worked.
also like one out of every 27 functions has a comment lmao
yea didn't work for me and it's hacky because it only works for one mod at once
what the hell
wait really why would challenges
wait we can't get the id yet so
<@162795183845539841> you have to deactivate all the othet mods.. challanges override other challenges
we've tried editing the itempools with whatever the xml is right
no itempools though how it seems ;(
Kek
my mod is showing up in isaac but it doesnt appear in custom challenges
so i finished making the challenge
wait we got an update? i just said fuck it and slept for a day and we can actually do things now?? cool
Later
bye
Also thanks again so much <@!120669965236830208> for doing this
i want the end stage to be mom
how do i do this
* endstage = the last stage of the challenge (use eLevelStage ids)
cya
Anyway im probably gonna stop spriting now
I got something planned for this can of beans
This "old" shit is so annoying
so there's still no itempool functions?
Its a can of beans
cya
Aight I'm going to bed
yup
niiice
huh
There you go
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mc1ff/how_to_create_a_challenge/dc2ho0q/
and look at it
jsut download a challenge mod from the workshop
oh?
you can make custom challenges
we can
<@162795183845539841> I don't think we can
anyone from here know how to make a custom challenge yet
The code's a bit of a clusterfuck, should I clean it up first?
no update for itempools? :D
Post code?
Setting it in the base code works fine
Setting it inside the callback with the passed player entity errors
`    Player stat - Only change this in a callback to MC_EVALUATE_CACHE. How much damage do the players tears or other main weapons do?`
Setting the damage works fine everywhere **except** where the docs tell you to set it
Because
I'm not sure what to think of this
fucking
Actually
ty BrosterMedia for the update
Kreygasm
Comments PogChamp
<@120355885615808512>
`no member named 'Damage'`
Setting it doesn't
Reading the damage works
`ply.Damage = ply.Damage + 10`, say
I'm having trouble with the stats tbh
erm
yeah
REALLY STATS?
The math library doesn't have an atan2 function?
we can edit player stats now
soo any updates for the api today? :D
uhh not us... I think anyway
okay which one of you guys made the oceanman music mod?
Also I got a new item idea
Somebody has already posted a mod on the workshop that brings you back a floor
Yep
mods can now modify player stats?
did i just read the update correct?
Hehehehe cool
I can't draw for shit so implementing someone else's sprites is great lol
np, it's fun
Ok cool thanks for doing this again
Working out the best way to tell whether an enemy's in the swing's area of effect
So how are things going <@!120669965236830208> ?
cool
Gotcha
I sent a friend request
That's a good idea
We should all make a mod together. We work really well together
yeah
Man time flies
its Pm here
whoops
It's 2:40 AM here I just noticed
Be back in a sec
oh snap
Whoa its  9:30 here
noice
Lookin good
A bit better?

Yeah it's really what sets in the style
That double wide border really changes everything
KK

the colors kinda blend in
I think the yellow could be darker maybe?
kk
Also I don't think the tip of the pencil needs to be double lined
Oops forgot to double line the ball
Ooh
It would send you to that room immediately but is consumed
Its called Memories or Reality
let's hear it
But i came up with an item you would unlock when getting to the bedroom room/floor
I wasnt able to think up something that could send you back a floor
Ok guys
That's gonna be tricky without having any sort of debug rendering :/
niiice
Now I need to only damage entities in the swing's range
I've got the logic working to prevent tears firing and only damage after a short cooldown
But I feel bad that it's just a copy paste, so I'm making new stuff.
It is just a copy paste.
Download my new mod:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835868610&searchtext=
POOOP
CUM
Y
WHY MUST U DO DID
NOOOOOOOOO
I made cum poop
Better Bean
Yo I know what to call the upgraded Butter Bean
I'm planning on it being a "Face-down Card" which, when used, would activate a random card effect
Also made this, which didn't come out how I meant for it to but I think it looks nice like this
anyone know how to spawn creep?
Noice
I feel like I might have used too many different shades on this but idk
I got an idea
I know
Not sure... something that evokes time or nostalgia?
But like what should it be?
kk
I do like that idea
You could sprite that item that goes back 1 floor
oh nice
this is the first time I've made isaac crash with a mod
There is actually a bseball bat gun in gungeon called casey that knocks back bulets
oh jeez
http://enterthegungeon.gamepedia.com/Fightsabre
You mean Casey?
would be really awesome for bullet hell bosses
Yeah
Great levels of detail they thought of everything
I just want something to reflect bullets like that gun in Gungeon
yeah
that's so cool
wait really?
oh nice
A baseball bat would be more Isaac-like
Yeah tech + the sword turns the sword into one
is it?
Well thats already in antibirth
¯\_(?)_/¯
Clearly a lightsaber
So uhhh what should I sprite next im kinda bored
It was in the patch notes
Anyone know off hand where the new functions are to get the joystick input?
except I forgot to put the really dark red used in the skull and crossbones
The colous he used
that's the pallette
Yeah I've gotta fix some perspective stuff
those pixels in the top left?
Looks Great!
That looks like a pretty good start
Omg
G I G A B U T T E R B E A N
Its ok <@251632757715894273> you will get better at that plumbus
get an item in the game
that's basically my life goal right now
For sure
Who knows if we could get it to function well it could be one of the items that are in the booster packs
unlike my plumbus XD
Really fits the game's art style
Yeah, good job on the art
This looks so amazing
Not yet <@129475107583295488>
cant even get him to play his existing animations on command
done
anybody figure out yet how to give isaac custom animations?
Sure man
It looks so natural ingame
Could the item description be "It holds a terrible secret"
I wish I could code I have tried but I just suck at it
Picking it up
It looks actually propper
Looks so good ingame
still looks nice tho
Yeah it doesn't do much yet lol
wait there was a problem with just making it an item?
THATS AMAZING
THANKS SO MUCH
WOOO
wOO
Hmm what's this?
Ooops caps
AND A BIT OF DAMAGE
is cain's advantage just his speed?
which is why I have my jason suggestion
We need to give more meaning to beds I think
Im back
Gt pee be back in a sec
NAILED IT
im absolutely shite at art, but i tried to make a plumbus
But I think if you did enter it you would have to like survive a wave of moms hands and legs coming down
It would just be a kind of bonus thing
Idk
yeee
In the bedroom there could be a mirror and it shows you as a demon
Or here foot
and he has a mirror in his room
or maybe mirrored isaac cause of the whole evil alter-ego thing
Fighting just regular mom on the basement with no items would be pretty tough already
Maybe you have to survive a round of her hands coming down?
Idk
But you would have to fight a special version of mom?
like a super error room
and a trap door
Yeah
like Isaac's toys
with a bunch of items in it
It could just be 1 room
Yeah
Honestly you could use the already existing bedroom textures to make that floor's visuals too
Umm sure
I have no idea
Doing a multiplier of your damage?
How do you picture the axe working damage-wise btw?
Yeah imagine the bedroom
Yeah
The tough part is creating the new floor really
That's probably doable due to the whole thing with the Backasswards challenge existing
Also thanks again <@!120669965236830208>
I want an item that sends you back a floor and if used in the basement as I said would bring you to a secret floor
working on getting your axe in the game Bob
I need this
sign me up
1 use when used you fart so hard you are shot up a floor going to the floor where you were before if used in basement you access a secret floor called the bedroom
you could probably use something along the lines of the Censer projectile reflection for that
does that exist?
A lightsaber that you swing like the axe and it reflects bullets
and it said "I can't believe it's not butter bean"
but it was actually way better than butter bean
You gave me an idea tho
Oh man
what if there was an item that looked like butter bean
Idea MEGA BUTTER BEAN
but it's too much like butter bean
I was going to say blocks projectiles, does a little damage, and knocks back
brilliant
lol
butter bean
wait hold up
BUTTER BEAN
knocks back
active item with 5s cooldown
shine
item idea
oh dang
we're hitting sm64 levels of speed weirdness bois
uh
also having exactly 0.00 speed gives you infinite speed
thanks
here is the animation file for the axe if you want it
0.1 is slow, but not as slow as you would think for being the minimum
so it's probably 5 + speed stat
-5 is you can't move
idk
stat*
but with mods...
so I'm guessing the speed state is just added on top of a base movement speed?
normally the range has to be between 0.1 and 2
The real Backasswards challenge
hahah that's amazing
that's... interesting
seriously
REALLY
lmao
if you go below -5 speed you start to move backwards
Hmmmm you could do it if you want I guess
holy shit guys
I'm looking at the documentation to figure out sprites and animation right now
Well idk about the transformation parts, but getting the item in the game and the swinging mechanics should be doable
Really <@!120669965236830208> ?
hey no problem
Anyway thanks for all your help guys! Man you really like this suggestion!
actually no that's not in the lua api
I think if we wait for antibirth to get unpacked we could probably use the code for the sword swing from that
Could get some of it working
or with what we got anyway
But I dont think its possible yet
It would be amazing if we could mod this in the game now
Yeah that'd be cool
or maybe to make it a little simpler have it so when it's thrown you just can't attack for 2 or 3 seconds and then you can attack again?
hmm yeah maybe it could be kind of a weak chaos card
I'm thinkin to balance it, you'd have to go pick it back up before you use it again, but that'd be a pain in the ass lol
But then its less of a risk
unless you want him shooting beaver teeth
the beaver would not be able to do that sadly
sure
uhhh
I just wanna see that thing spin in the air
What if you only swing the axe when you release the button, and charging for more than let's say 2 seconds throws it instead?
It would be great if we could get this in a mod lol
Spinning axe looks sweet
lol
to lazy
I will do that later
Uhh
Oh yeah the tail
Imagine this with ludo controlable sppinning axe
is it gonna have a beaver tail?
niiice
Fixed it
instead of player.MoveSpeed
and it was because I had player.Speed
I just realized that I've spent the past hour on a bug that stopped my item from working
is that in the ab+ animation editor? I still haven't tried it out yet
Maybe "plumbodes"?
"Everyone has a Plumbus in their home"
plumbii
Is it "plumbuses"?
you wouldn't *dare*
hey plumbus hope you don't mind if i make a mod that adds plumbuses as a trinket ?

awesome haha
oh yeah I was about to mention that
forgot double thick lines on ears
Oh shit
looks sick
ninja'd
yep
Reference is from Don't Starve
don't starve?
Basically if you chop too many doors open you turn into a Were Beaver that is really slow can only bite and im still thinking up some other stuff
WorldToScreenPosition \o/
stats can be edited \o/
yeh
The API got an update, eh?
OH
oh
It may look like shite it was kinda hard to do
?
hype
oh snap
i finished the change
k
so 4th is similar to 3rd and then it starts tapering down in the 5th
edited the trail of the 4th and 5th frame a bit
Huh
i tried photoshop after years of using pdn and i hated it. dunno why. probably just wasn't good at it XD
I need to get more used to paint.net, I basically just switched to it a few days ago cause I had photoshop cs2 before but it seems adobe took it off their site so I couldn't get it on my new computer
looks like the same speed
yeah
hm
the swing trail is shorter, kinda like you slowed down mid-swing
I think the 4th frame there would look weird in the animation
yeah that looks much better thanks
global magic wand with 0% tolerance is useful for finding semi transparent pixels

but I guess I missed some
I basically rotated them, and then erased all the semitransparent pixels I could see before retouching them
did you just rotate the sprites? the shading gets pillow on some of them
aight thanks
one sec touching it up
whoops
oh shoot do they?
<@113732793787351044> some of the sprites in that have semitrasparent pixels
If you took the screenshot might be able to help make it easier
Nah didnt get it fixed but I can easily work around it
np
So no screenshot? Did you get it fixed?
Also thanks <@113732793787351044>
Its really weird
Its just a glitch I think
was that nvm about the screenshot or the problem?
<@!188945290923868161> I made a kinda crude idea of the swing animation for you
I use photoshop but it's great
yea .psd saving and reading in paint.net is really convenient
i love it
it's really amazing
yeah paint.net is great
Barely anyone I've met uses it
You probably have it set to global instead of contiguous
I'm so glad everyone here is a paint.net fan
nvm
extensive plugin support too
paint.net is great
Pain.net is really good for pixel art
Yea it does
i've been using paint.net for years, it does have a tolerance
yes it does
on the paint.net window
kk
take a screenshot
percentage*
nope
Never used Paint.Net but does it have a "tolerance" percetange like Photoshop's wand selection?
is anti alias on?
I use the bucket tool to fill a space with a different colour but it fills the different colours around it also
fill what?
What to do?
when I fill in it fills all the colours except the black
Ummm
You can give it an animation file to read for the axe
Asking again today: has anyone figured out how to access the Config/Item classes?
It seems possible, but no one has done it yet.
for Isaac
Can you add animations and run them in script?
The damage part should be pretty easy, I'm not sure about making the axe swing animation
I will give you a hint tho "Ds"
k
Not spoiling it until I have sprited it
which is...
The "change" part
what is the price?
its great for speed running but comes with a price
Its a risk kind of item
Swing in direction
This aint gonna be a moms knife thing
Do you swing in a specific direction when you hit the direction key or just control it like the sword?
Nah
Can you throw it like Mom's Knife?
But shorter and with the slashy thing just behind the actual blade
Depends how you want it to act
ye
Hmmm
You could try and base it off that sword item from Antibirth?
How would I do start doing that even?
No idea how im going do a swing animation
Yeah I just kinda had the top a little different
Now make it swing
Pretty similar
whoa

<@!188945290923868161> Didn't notice you had already fixed it, but I decided to try my hand at thickening it for you
damn how do items like holy mantle work
nope
is there a callback for clearing a room of enemies?
Looks good man
Now time to make the... change
nice shading
i think it looks great personally
yeah good work
Especialy since im new to paint
Doesnt look half bad in my opinion
Fixed it
looks like lua actually doesn't have a great way to do immutables
i would have known once, i used to use lua all the time
not sure...
cannot be changed
a variable that once you declare it
what do you mean by constant? global var?
just const?
how do I do a constant in lua?
johnny transformation?
"The Axe"
"It feels cursed..."
Turns your tears into a melee axe swing which can bust open doors. Upon breaking too many doors you... change.
and i downloaded it and it's 36x36 pixels, should be 32x32 like other isaac items
Looks p good, but maybe try to make the borders on it 2 pixels thick to fit Isaac's style
Still Wip
nice! 32x?
There

save as .png
save it as png
how do I turn it into a image?
wait
Oh
Made in Paint.net
im an idiot, should have tried that earlier
ayy i fixed it, just needed to open as admin XD
Try running it from cmd
dont think so
/a hostile room or something?
is there a callback for entering a new room?
that's how I've done it
is one supposed to just double click the exe file or is there another way to open it and i'm just dumb?
nope, no rebirth open
but that might not be your problem either
also it counts as an instance of rebirth so don't have both open at once
i have
try restarting steam
¯\_(?)_/¯
oh. I have no idea
steam is most certainly running
no as in custom unlocks added to the game
mod uploader tool is completely and totally broken for me, i open it and it says "Initializing Steam API... Failed. Please make sure Steam is running and then relaunch this app"
you'd need a non-workshop mod that circumvents the system
no. unlocks are disabled when mods are enabled
no clue
Ayy, is it currently possible to add unlocks through mods?
yeah
you gotta do player.Damage = player.Damage + 1
but ok
damn
no, += doesn't exist in lua
player.Damage += 1?
yep
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
I can just go
yeah I have the modulo for when it happens
I think the mod tool won't update correctly if you change the folder name or mod name
use post update callback, check the gametime to see if an interval is passed (by checking if it's divisible by such and such) and then set player stats by just using Isaac.GetPlayer(0) and setting the stats variables
how do I change stats without flags
so then the question is
The Mod uploaded tool seems bugged. I tried updating a mod, and it created a new mod, and updated the mod I wanted to change...
I'll have to fix it tomorrow
ugh i was about to go to bed
flags should only be used in cache evaluations
i had a lot of links in my description
<@134108150155444224> not in my experience
You just need to keep the scale of states in mind, which is possible using the Found HUD
Yeah
every time you update your mod it deletes your description
I'm making a mod that changes your speed over time. Flags probably aren't the way to go right?
what the fuckkkk
I think all stats are float. But that wouldn't matter for the API, as Lua handles number types transparently.
so 2.00 is the maximum for speed
k
yes
what I meant was that speed is the same thing as you see in the game
Thought tear delay was an int
all stats are floats
no problem
no, it doesn't matter where it goes in the line
<@134478547795443712> sorry i take so long to respond, getting caught up in things
Not tired at all
Gah I can't sleep.
night bois cya in 8 hours
here's what i got done today tho http://pastebin.com/vBmMmq1H
night
ok bois i'm off
like is wooden spoon +.3 or is it something else in the code
also is movespeed a float? so +1 speed is a huge speed up?
does it matter where I put it in the line?
Trinket: "Snappy's Tail"
Description: "Shoot Faster. Walk Slower"
cool
to your items.xml
to make sure your item triggers a cache evaluation for the right stats, add, for example, cache="damage speed" to get it to do speed and damage
i think the way it is is ok
speed down, damage way up
in fact you might want to make snappy's head a clear description too
better than cryptic description xd
HP up + protection
"It's sturdy" for shell maybe
the descriptions tho
ye
is that good?
---Snappy Expansion---

Item: "Snappy's Head"

how so
gotta make sure to have the cache stuff set in your items.xml too
thanks
local mutatedcells = RegisterMod("Mutated Cells",1)
local mutatedcells_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Mutated Cells")

function mutatedcells:setstats( n, flag )
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(mutatedcells_item) then
    if flag==CacheFlag.CACHE_DAMAGE then
      player.Damage = player.Damage + 5
    elseif flag==CacheFlag.CACHE_SPEED then
      player.MoveSpeed = player.MoveSpeed + 1
    end
  end
end

mutatedcells:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, mutatedcells.setstats );
yeah
but can someone give me example code of a passive stat change?
I am very late to the party on this
yeah item pools are messed up right now
so item pool support in the api seems total shite, no way to add items to pools without using dyamically assigned numerical ids
---Snappy Expansion---

Item: "Snappy's Head"
Description: "Slow and steady wins the race."
Effects: SPD- DMG+ // Damage Multiplier for each 0.1 speed down 0.2x Multiplier
Added: No
oh ok I got you
how di i manage to type snappy like that
wow
all 3 snammoy items in a mod
no like
cause idk who would want only one of these items and not all of them
nah just make snappy one mod
and snappy pack as another
and add "base" with some items
hmmm i could make the item expansion a collection in the workshop
ALOT of Prophets of war
better but the crown lines look kinda odd
and you know what that means?
I would make a snappy mod and release it seperate from your other pack

its also gonna take some time
this is going to be sick
yeah that's nice
scales to max 1/6 with high luck
i like the shell just adding hp and a 1/10 chance to block incoming damage
i mean
I have never seen it before
oh wow I didn't even know what that item was
but based on your movement, not your aiming
what if the shell was a backwards trinity shield
ye
this good cuz i gotta go in 10 mins?
Gives you something similar to the effect of Infamy
shell - defense
head - spd down dmg multiplier
tail trkinket - speed -0.10 firerate+ shotspeed+

Snappy: transformation makes you slower but gives you an extra heart container and damage
and of course the costume
and of course the costume
transformation makes you slower but gives you an extra heart container and damage
now we decide what the transformation do
shot speed too
ok
shell - defense
head - spd down dmg multiplier
tail trkinket - speed -0.10 firerate+
oh

and they;re very cute
yes
Is it possible to do something like stopping a room from appearing with an item
do tortoises have tails tho
(Shot speed increases knockback)
takes away the risk of having low speed
meh
It is a great idea: you are slower, but make ennemy less fast at catching you. Plus this synergies somewhat with other Snappy items.
or just not even touch tear delay and just go for tears
to balance it out
maybe give it some shot speed too
cancer is op as fuck
its important to be consistent
trinkets are usually simpler than items
Cancer is -2
yeah
oh
just the exact stats
oh I wouldn't make the trinket scaling too
delay = speedLoss*10
pretty close
idk the scaling of tear delay exaclty
like speed -.10, tear delay -1?
nice
tears?
in exchange for some other stat
it takes away your speed
"snappy's tail can be a trinket that trades speed down for some other effect" does it give you speed dow or does it take it away
xd
I didn't read your mind
lol
I mean I read your question and answered it
spooky
you awnsered my question while i was typing it
fuck
and trinkets have been in transformations
tail trinket
whats should be the 3rd item to complete the transformation
shell - defense
head - spd down dmg multiplier
>Item Expansion Mod v1.0 [WIP]

Made By: KyoZM
-Guests: plumbus, owltruism (dot forget to add!)
sickkk
i'll add you as contributor ?
if i do all your suggestions my mod will have 7 items and 1 transformation
give me a shoutout though
I will
kyo you should go for this
yes
Not to lilith' comment, but to plumbus'
maybe the shell would work for that
Damn, that's a great idea.
something i've been thinking on for a while is wafer effect but only on red hearts
this is the makings of an epic mod
snappy's tail can be a trinket that trades speed down for some other effect
snappy's shell can be a defensive thing
https://sites.google.com/site/tortoiselibrary/fun-stuff/tortoise-pet-names
maybe that could be the transformation effect for a set of items based on snappy
lmao
Snappy's head or something lol
you could make an entire collection of items around his pet tortoise
since when does isaac have a pet tortoise tho
*line
would be in like with cricket's head
isaac's pet tortoise's head?
maybe
yeah probably not a shell
Oh yes, I see.
also it gives you damage when u pick it up
Something with shell sounds more defensive in my opinion
and also it gives you a flat damage stat too
that multiplier is no joke
^
it's too powerful to be a trinket
I feel like this could be a trinket: it is situational and you can drop it or ignore it if it is useless to you.
at isaac speed you get 1.6x damage multiplier, at maggie it's doubled
Damage up, speed down. For each 0.1 of speed you have below 1.3, you get an extra 0.2x damage multiplier
What was the item idea?
tortoise shell?
tortoise foot?
something tortoise related
DEFINITELY not blood of speed
but definitely not blood of speed
description is a+
got a better one?
Blood of speed? lol
<@134478547795443712> i got it! Name: Blood of speed (lol idk)  Description: slow and steady wins the race
even monstro doesn't have that thickness ratio I'm pretty sure
compare to ministro
the lines are really thick for such a small sprite
Anything?
Its a boss portrait btw
Again, we should wait a week. Right now we would need a big mode to improve the ability to coordinate between modes and add "cleanly" items, ennemies, floors etc without breaking other mods
So what should I change?
Ah ok thanks a bunch
yea pdn would help
i am editing it in paint right now as we speak
spawn 5.100.id
Bob it's addorable and perfect
spawn 5.100.itemid
dumb question but how do you get items to spawn on pedestals instead of just giving it to yourself?
paint.net
how to improve
nah
"sword of the slug"
ahg i cant think of a name for your item idea plum
:^)
literally
ya
Oh, the ability to set the player stats is game changing
mfw i saw the docummentation
as small as it gets

yeah
actually now that I think about it 6foot canvasses aren't even big
lel
looks like it fits in the game > artistic masterpieces on 6 foot canvasses
you can get a good level of detail without making it extend to the outer edges of the image
not enough pixels
also, plumbus, how tho
looks like shit either way
Maybe it is rusty
make your sprites smaller kyo!!!!
just not random gray pixels pls
or do something like this
put it on one edge
and yeah don't use dark greys randomly around the blade
I would use more colors, also the handle is really small
no
what?
also ^^
is that the blade to blood rights?
what's that shading
eww

do y'all get lag when you get crazy powerful late game? it's only been happening recently
I think *especially* for items you need to use something that has transperancy, layers, good support for small images

Prob me lol
ask yourself: whose fault is it? the program's or yours?
I may use paint for boss portraits
well that's not really fair lol bob
i've tried to use piskel and it was.......pretty bad
then this
if it works for you go for it
are you sure
This looks better

im stick to piskel
screw it
We live in the future
wooo
Heyyy now a third of the doc is documented
if you try it
let me know if the mod works for you
xd
mind if i roll threee
I got threeeeeeee versions
plus shops, libarries, bosses, etc
every floor has 3 versions
I thought it was like 10 for some reason
never mind lol
oh shit
30
like
how many tracks are there?
sounds like a hell of a lot of work
that would be fun
I should cover all of the isaac music and make that into a mod
cool
It's nice to make mods you'll use yourself lol
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835796562
nut dat yt video tho
antialiased stuff looks terrible in this game, sticking to pixels is the best option always
if you want to make sprites you should do it at the 32x32 size, not make it big and then resize it down
Grilled steak
xD
or a shoe
is that a steak
it sucks
Here is what ive got
wow

basically the only thing I do in here is shamelessly promote myself to prop up my ego
yes
can i post my mod? just finished posting
thanks!
oh, alright
items.xml
hey, i want to try and make a translation for the game, where to start?
also the reckoning item was inspired by The Last In Line by Dio "Two eyes from the east
It's the angel of the beast
And the answer lies between the good in me"
i like it aswell
definitely changes the atmosphere on the late game
good thing mods make it an option though
I think it's a super cool part of the game
<@126426442555719680> aw I like that. You choose a path not by just going through doors, but by shaping your run in preperation
LOL I KID
I was hoping to get rid of all that polaroid and key peice nonsense with the tools
mind if i ask you your IQ?
what problem are you running into
Its killing me
im talking about paint.net
that's an obscure inspiration for that item effect lol
what is it that you dont get?
that's part of the lyrics from In the presence of enemies by DT
I dont get it
"Angels fall
all for you
heretic"
make it hold a key to communicate that it isnt just A E S T H E T I C S
^ thought of that aswell
and make the statue still black
make the angels a dark reskin
i got the idea from a DreamTheater song
If you wanted to go even further
that's a sweet item
pretty much
so you can get devil deals but still finish your post it
that's sick
I get it
OH
you make it viable by making it possible to get keypieces from angel statues man
A L L A D V A N T A G E S A R E W O R T H I T
What does making the mega satan path viable do?
nice item 10/10
lol
^
i thought it made angels non-flying for some reasaon
oh
Effects: DMG+1 Makes Mega Satan path viable with devil precident. Adds Angel statues to devil deal rooms.
M I N M A X
only angels
lul
yes
does it make angels fall
thats my 2nd item
Item: "Heretic"
Description: "Angels Fall!"
xd
then I code and do the other stuff
then I sprite
I think of wacky effects that haven't been done yet
yeah that's like literally the exact opposite of me lol
and then the effect
then the art
i think of an item and description first
you guys' item creation process is diffrent from mine
really does
flips the game
but in exchange you get sick dps
basically it makes speed up items useless unless you really want them
cool
I'm working on my sick speedrun item rn
go for it
mind if i use ur idea? xd
that seems cool
isaac default speed (which is still slow) it's 1.6
that means that at maggie speed it's double damage
and then for each .1 below 1.3 speed, you get an extra 0.2x damage
Lower speed
the damage multiplier is 0 at 1.3 speed and above (which is after like one belt)
Add tar
Yea
I'm saying like
that would decrease your damage if you got speed stuff
Add a water gun that shoots a stream of tears and charges every 2 rooms
well that sucks
sice default speed is 1
theres not alot of ways to slow yourself down in boi
dmg = dmg * 1/spd
seems meh
so
like the lower your speed is, the higher the damage multiplier is
and then even more damage for having low speed
how about an item that gives you damage up and speed down
?
cause i want to releas a mod that adds 5 items
Antibirth fortune cookie???
now i have to thinlk of a new item
r i p
fortune cookie is gone forever
aight
cause that is an easy mistake to make
got an empty color because you were in a different layer?
that the color you have selected with the teardropper
create a new layer
is it possible
when I use the second layer do draw over my first sprite the pencil/brush keeps on adding grey pixels
I like it better than photoshop
paint.net is the best ever
once you get over the initial learning curve
select your layer, click pencil icon
figured it out
nvm
layers

how do decrease increace the opacity?
now i gotta make a god dang thumbnail
because i'm bad
took me like 2 and a half hours
got files from Mudeth
followed ya
Oh.
<@!182509747835109387> no, i ported antibirth music to afterbirth+

finished my antibirth music mod
yeah over the two days I've been modding pretty much just outkast
but recently Outkast
I listen to a bunch of things
what kind of music do you listen to plum?
what's the new item that gives you shots in random directions somtimes?
take me by the hand
under image there's a resize tool <@!188945290923868161>
lol
also ocean man
how do I resize my big drawing into sprite sized?
Dream Theater - Prophets of War
What music do you guys listen to while modding?
alternatively you can go to  a average floor and get the time it took to beat it by the # of rooms
have fun
you can get it
and divide the nuber of rooms by the time
if you take an avg run
i mean
what's the average room clear time
use the pencil tool
zoom in really far, the image is only like 32x32
Thanks
Perfect
I have an image from reddit with the color palette of isaac too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ68vYqzSm0
and work off of that for size
I usually take an existing sprite
yep
Teach me sensei
paint.net?
So like how should I sprite in paint? Im guessing its altot different from piskel
Ok I figured it out
i like the fire tho
xD
I can't. It's mesmerizing.
look at toolbar above
dont look at canvas
demonstrating where the antialiasing is
Please never add that to the game.
Hopefully.
Concept art, probably.
wat
disable antialising on brush
is horrid
brush
no
Gottem
kk
you use brush instead of pencil
like, look at my other sprites, cant even tell it was from the same person
how do I change the wiidth of my pencil in paint.net?
It's kinda ugly anyways, yeah.
causei hate the sprite
i really want to get rid of it
Unfortunate Cookie could be a clever name.
this the fortune cookie code
player.Damage = player.Damage + (math.random(-1,2) + math.random()) + 0.3 + (player.Luck/2)
but it shuffles them
of all time
one of the best item designs
experimental treatment is close
experimental treatment
Isn't there something that already has that exact effect as it is anyways?
the only sprite iI really hate is that one
time to scrap that item then
oh damn it does
Think Antibirth adds a Fortune Cookie, which if integrated might conflict with that somehow.
just like the trap-influenced beats
like yo mama
Don't stare.
your sprites are big and thick
Item: "Fortune Cookie"
Description: "Draw your fortune!"
Effects: All stats change. you have a higher chance for the stats to go up and if it goes down, it's not by much
Added: In the game, no effect.
yes
What is that, a fortune cookie?
cant belive i did this on the same day as that
shading is nice
Sounds sort of like a reverse Taurus to me.
tell that to wire coat hanger
like don't use the outer boundary of the image as the guideline for how big it is
looks great but again that sprite is huge!
*a new room that is
its here bois
what do you guys think of an item that gives you a bunch of speed whenever you enter a room, but decreases over time and has a minimum cap of like .75?
More or less.
like actually ACTUALLY?
cause you can only shoot that fast
making tears control the speed works very well
Man, that sounds really fun, actually.
True
11/10
??
no
best API 10/10
wow this API is the greatest i've seen
you would want to make the damage scale
ah yeah if tears were defunct
Oh, hey jerbear.
Disagree with making it harder the further down you go, but increasing tear speed makes them go faster, which both gives you more potential damage and more difficulty.
Oh alzarath's here
that would also be cool
I think it'd be neat to replace your tears completely and do tiny damage to everything every successful key-press.
so you want to turn isaac into crypt of the necrodancer
and then it gets harder the further down in the basement you go
it did a necronomicon effect every like 12 key hits
what if arrow keys fell down the screen, and if you hit them with correct timing and the right keys
it works, but anytime luck is updated from another source it resets to 0
In the context of modding BoI, I don't know.
why though? xD
anybody mess with the animation editor and know how they made their frames for tears 1 long frame, versus making 15 individual frames?
okay, so i'm trying to get this item to give you a very small luck up every x seconds
oh
Some rhythm game.
dance dance revolution
what's a DDR?
also
thanks
make it cap at 1/2
but what if it isn't
well
What if their luck is 0?
what if their luck is 8
should scale it
so chance = 1/(8 - player.Luck)
oh yea we can do that now
Sounds okay. Honestly I've never liked 'chance' items, but it doesn't sound like a negative addition to the game. Affected by luck, I take it?
make the two tears have high shot speed
Seems cool
opinions?
has anyone considered a DDR-like mod for isaac?
```Item: "Screwdriver"
Description: "brraap!"
Effects: +FireRate has 1/8 chance to shoot 2 tears at the same time. if player has screw shoots 4 tears with 1/4 chance
Added: Only sprite is done```
You'll need one (or 3) at the start and end of your code (block).
I can never seem to remember the name of it.
`
Yeah, but without shift.
'this
` The tilde-thing.
lol how do u do this code block
""" test
''' test
good for spriting too
pretty easy
we just use it
how did we figure it out?
>this guy
How did you guys figure out paint.net?
>It's a nuclear throne reference
this is pretty great
okay 1/3 remake
this good?
ok
just the remake of my current costume
not much
did I miss stuff?
ok my internet died
and the tears just went into rainbowmode
now it kinda looks like 2 prisms were sticked into his eye holes
Nice!

I guess cache is when the character's entire stats are recalculated, not just added onto.
Errr, wait.  Was calling it in cache.  Just need to do it constantly instead of just once. >.>
I made a remake of the current prism costume
lets see
Wow, yeah.  Looks like stats need to be adjusted per update.  Weird that they'd insist on only changing it during cache check.
it was larger than that
belive me,
it's wayyy bigger than all of the other items
I would suggest making the sprite a bit smaller though
nice
if Game():GetDevilRoomDeals() == 0 then
if tou took devil deals or not
Sure, the games won't be connected but we can at least see everyone else moving
precedent? like your devil/angel chance?
Also, maybe we can make bare bones online by doing this:
Isaac moves > sends movements to server > the server sends movements to everyone else's game
Item: "Reckoning"
Description: "Divine judgement befalls on you!"
Effects: Gives you 2 medium tier or 1 good tier devil/angel item depending on your precedent.
Added: Yes
what does it do
I was confused about what that item actually does though
ah ye
my twittwr name is Leonardo Sousa
twitch raids isaac edition
which one was that?
nice!
eyy plum my mod got Rt'd by edmoind aswell ?
Brilliant
<@266032468853915650> I second paint.net
it crashes the game
and when we write a command in chat
and add connec to chat
malke a really cool mod
we can make a mod to troll streamers
guys
This is amazing, I didn't know you could connect to actual servers with the lua functionality
you can put clandestine files
yeah
But, still this mod isn't a virus
Wow really?
someone uploaded all of antibirth the first day, including the .exe
not sure about that last part actually
But definately not a virus since that's not how uploading isaac mods to workshop works
Well it LOOKS fully functional, since all the code is there
I've downloaded and it's fully functional
no they linked the code to it
It's not.
It'd be a shame if the first cool mod was actually a virus ?
Uploaded by a low-level private account
With that power it might be possible to put in actual online
that is actually super imprssessive and gives me hope
wow

no idea why it doesn't work for me then

what type of callback is that within? post_update?
```  if player:HasCollectible(item)==true then
    debug_text = player.FrameCount;
    if(player.FrameCount % 60 == 0) then
        player.Damage = player.Damage + 0.5

how?
just got it working for me
Does changing player stats actually do anything?  I've been messing with player.Damage and player.MaxFireRate and the game doesn't appear to care.
Not sure if creating a character is completely supported.  Looks like the character menu is hardcoded.

It just dont amke sense
And
Well I have paint on my computer
huh
It's kind of a free photoshop
Gimp?
or give gimp a try
try paint.net
bob
anyone have any luck changing tears based on luck stat? like say tough love ish
I must be retarted
I just dont get it
How do you even use paint
I need to improve the prism eyes
or anything, yeah
nice costume
would be nice if we had documentation on how to create a character
for some unknown magical reasons the devs werent lazy on that part
but thanks dud
i'd much rather have code
what a shit way to do this
they get linked through that
the costume anm2 (in my case "light prison.anm2") **must** match the Item name (im my case "Light Prison")
Idk even how to code
but its simple
took me quite a while to figure it out
SHOW ME THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
lol
TEAMCH ME
COSTUMZ
I NEED
HOQW
tadaa
```oh shit```

It dont have that shit
I use piskel
remember
And use the lines to create the sprite
a couple of other mods have it apparently, like the pizza one
And then shrink it down
Draw a larger version of the sprite first
rather than a lua thing
cute monstro
yeah I figure that costumes are an xml/folder thing
D'aww
this

I need help

Had to follow those exact steps.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5ma1jp/how_to_add_a_costume_to_isaac_without_adding_the/
Got costume to work.
and show u the stuff in a sec, lol
now I need 1 second to get all of this into my head
but wow
Nice.
lol
its true
omfg
I need to see it
or maybe?
~~it would be too much work for the devs~~
doubt that
Maybe it grabs a costume with an appropriate filename by default?
but Im either blind or there is nothing refering to the custom costume
workshop
mhm
Is the mod downloadable?
but idk how they do it
excluding the person which made the Trinity mod
Fun!
nobody has yet a freaking idea how to use costumes
It seems to want a Config::Item, but not sure how to provide that.
Has anyone gotten EntityPlayer:AddCostume() to work?
instead of heart containers
I'm trying to give Isaac enemy HP
That doesn't really help me, I'm trying to figure out the amount of damage an enemy would do if it were charmed
<@72413153614368768> ```lua
function mod:DMG(damagedEntity, damageAmount, damageFlag, damageSource)
  if damageSource.IsCharmed then
    -- damageAmount is the amount of damage a charmed enemy just dealt to another enemy
  end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, mod.DMG)
```
just save me
```XML
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Break the Light!" gfx="Collectibles_Lightprison.png" name="Light Prison"/>

<costumes anm2root="gfx/characters/">

    if player:HasCollectible(player, prism_item) == true then
    
    end
    
end

fuffles:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, fuffles.passiveItems, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER );```
probs not
I wonder if that means "A CHAMPION RED SMALL CRAZY LONG LEGS" would run into a second line if it read out ingame
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1c9GZPUkAAO3O6.jpg:large So apparently fortune teller messages are stored in a txt file, and longer messages are formatted appropriately when drawn ingame
will stay for 3 more hours
yes
How do you prevent a certain type of drop from spawning
Omg <@266032468853915650> you've been in this chat all day
Im getting really tired of this >.<
Does anyone know how to get the damage charmed stuff does?
idk then
yea
did you create the anm2 file?
this mod has a custom costume linked to their item, but there is nothing that refs the costume O.o
okay this is some darkmagic
but damage is also doubled
maybe make all damage sources be doubled
hm
do you guys think an item would be good that made all damage deal a full heart, but increased speed and damage
I think some of the most fun items are high risk high reward
Nice
i tried to use Entity.CollisionDamage but that just does 1 damage
he's amazing
dude mudeth just sent me the sound files
i'm trying to make an item that give Isaac enemy HP
thanks then
how bizarre
can you not get the amount of damage a charmed enemy does?
sigh, still trying to figure stuff out
It's weird, yeah. I tried to do as it says, and it didn't work. I put it in the update callback, and it worked just fine.
yeah
I mean this.
I see it's just in a regular update here
that depends what you mean by read about and by documentation
<@145740433165647873> Did you read about that in the documentation?
i'm trying to mod phd to only give *actually* good pills
why can you not spawn all items
http://pastebin.com/uWtJ6nzD
what passive mods have yall got so far
if I just put that somewhere else it seems to do nothing
yeah but I need to deal with the cache
player.Damage = 1.5 + player.Damage
One clearly thinks it's better than the other plumbus
so who has a stat change working and how did they do it
What's the difference between PostUpdate and PostPerfectUpdate?
I feel like delirium was meant to represent Isaac's insanity, but sometimes I feel with 2 fuckups with him now that the boss really just represents our insanity seeing this boss quality
yay!!
i just spawned 4 randoms
yeah
may be new for the patch
huh you sure?
it's all the fool
i just spawned the hermit
nope
I love delirium
nah it's random i think
you need to find the card's subtype
Lol
spawn in a generic tarot card and it'll just give the fool
fuck
lol
oh
so you have to look up the card's subtype
just found it
of course the console is shit and a half
using the spawn command
he'll freeze and softlock the game
how do i spawn cards
pssst
even if you use kill commands, yeah
not only is he ugly but you can't beat him
literally it cannot die even if you use kil commands
https://gfycat.com/BountifulSleepyAmericangoldfinch
he looks like a blobfish
yeah the delirium anims are horrible lol
but cannot be killed
did you see the new delirium anims lmao
no it works now
oh wait
And because they rushed to release it, delirium is a png boss
they couldn't have even guessed that it would be excusable to push the api out the door without stats though
That's why the game wasn't on time, because they were rushing to create delirium
can you spawn pills and cards???
And made the actual in game content a week before launch
Went on vacation
The finished the api a month into developmenf
No
or they threw it half together and assumed they could wrap the rest all up like a week before launch
honestly that's true tbh
true tbh
lol
To be honest let's be honest -Portal2k17
it sure seems that way portal
i could just spawn emperor
tbh lets be honest they threw it together in like a month and never worked on it again
oh
it's a tragedy
is there any command to go straight to boss room?
Like if it's cancer now imagine what it was before launch
Edmund wanted to get kil the modding Api *early*
Just imagine
Limt
don't even try to kappa
welp
:Kappa:
it has been a year
you can make donkey kong Kappa
it should be complete now, it should be documented now
AB+ the only Isaac mod or expansion to be canceled after its been released
you shouldn't have to withold judgment, tyrone said this could remake antibirth, tyrone said this could make a whole new game
ok why do i start every run as if i picked up eden's blessing
I'd rather choose another starter
Because AB+ is cancelled
i will withold judgement
You right Tyrone, it isn't
Apparently it's **not even it's final form!**
Because that will take *effort*
no it will get 5% better
but will it make a full recovery?
So I *doubt* they'll make a console that will auto complete commands
But I believe it will get better
I'm not happy with the current modding api
And auto generated comments and documentation
They made a modding api that is nowhere near what they said it would be
lol
Think... okay it's Nicalis
Let's think for a second siren
I give up
Well
is there a way o get decimals out of math.random?
i mean i can survive but i was wondering
but commands you do
and you don't have to complete item names
yes
press up to copy the last thing you wrote in the console to the current line
tfw u need help and you dont get any
in the console i mean
?
are you joking or
hold up
Or within lua files
In the console?
Antibirth survived longer than anything Nicalis has ever made
it's not tab or alt + space
can we autocomplete commands in the console?
no luck
i tried using the one in the mod tools
No unpacker for Antibirth yet
when one const aint enough
but he's never on twitter so settle in
Yeah i tweeted him
```LUA
const const Costume &```
Then you gonna have that talk to Kil
i even tried that
exactly flotilla
lol did no one ever make an unpacker for antibirth
sigh I wish what this meant
<@266032468853915650> Using the OST would be bad, you can't get intro/loop tracks
I already own that
It doesn't have all the stuff that's in the game
Yeah but like
<@134108150155444224> https://mudeth.bandcamp.com/releases
Nifty, then
Yes
Did you ask Kilburn for permission to use his mod's music in your own
Decompilers don't work
You can't extract them yet
trying to find a way to extract them for antibirth music mod
what about them
no one got any ideas on the antibirth sound files?
tbh using shaders in mac is a pain
Nice example tyrone
"NOTE: This shader *does not work on Mac*. It's very difficult to get the busted Mac shader compiler to cooperate, even for a shader this simple. Sorry!"
ikr
One of Nicalis' example mods, by their own admission, doesn't work on mac
but I need 1 tiny help
loool
acctually, I might figure out how to add costumes
ah k
yes
this

they had a fucking year to write lua documentation
hm?
export it  to 32 bits
when this was the original purpose of the dlc
32 bits
after a year now
'early days'
hey guys, i replaced larry jr with a reskin of him, i did his intro aswell, and it worked, but then this weird texture error appeared, any idea on how to fix it?
you should see some of the amazing "generated" comments...
?
"To the brave intrepid Lua modders: We heard your criticism and we understand. It's still early days for the modding API. You can look forward to new possibilities as we open up access to more of the game's features and create more samples for you to base your mods on."
not that they're even good patch notes!
When the reception was so poor that you're forced to write patchnotes for the first time in 3 years
http://steamcommunity.com/games/250900/announcements/detail/248095310194829089
yeah
wooh
yes
Was there an update?
<@145740433165647873> "They only just now added stats"
just, help
idk how to make one for mine
most costumes from ing have a name id
I have no idea how to do this
they only just now added stats
not sure about enemy ai
no map or curse
worthless
they're not docs, they're just lists
yeah docs is a misnomer
yeah the docs are pretty useless tbh
I love the people
I had only done python and c++ up until a day ago, and the community + trial and error helped me to make two mods already
the people are fine, the tools and documentation make you want to go on a shooting spree
that depends what you mean by this scene
what the fuck are you saying to me
`[INFO] - [Birdfood] Error in PostUseItem call: bad argument #2 to '?' (number has no integer representation)`
there is nothing about that
what the f can you even put in the costumes.xml file
and of course the manual install download on the website is down. *sigh*
idk siren
but i need **you**
I have permission from the authors to make an antibirth music mod, just fyi
now how do I find my own costumes name id...
Oh yeah is there any news on item pools yet?
hmm
Any idea how I can extract Antibirth's sound files?
Hola
Finally comments, except half of these are more cryptic than the apis they describe
Kappa
Oh brother

ah damn this guy's stealing all the best ideas!
cause if not I got dibs
Is there an item/trinket already that makes your soul hearts black hearts?
Bye.
bye
im gonna go now too, cya
gn
nice
o
later and gl
I'm going to bed, feeling ill after all this
which is a costume
ya, I updated to add a bag over your head item
the hiding of isaac?
check out my mod or the pizza mod on how this is done
you can, just add the files into resources folder in your mod folder
but like, cant you make a custom costume tho
it's grotesque
I've been a programmer for 18 years and I've seen some bad API, this is not the worst but it's not good
it's horrific
the whole api is like this
<@!95444500364660736> welcome to what we have been yelling about for the last 3 days
it just keeps getting better
GREAT DOCUMMENTATION
wow
Oh my god. Am I retarded or does this not work the way it's described in the documentation? It says: ```Damage
     Player stat - Only change this in a callback to MC_EVALUATE_CACHE.```
So I do as they say, I put it in that callback, then do `player:EvaluateItems()` and nothing happens, but if I put it into MC_POST_UPDATE callback, everything works!
thanks
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5ma1jp/how_to_add_a_costume_to_isaac_without_adding_the/
dunno why nobody upvoted it since we were trying to figure this out for like a day
or add a costume with code
<@266032468853915650> I added a thread on how you can add your own costumes
like with lua
i heard you cannot overwrite stuff in the game, is this true?
and some tutorials as well
the tools are availiable in the subreddit
maybe i should actually figure out how this all works before i sprite
oh whoops got hit in a wall of .a files
anyone knows how costumes work in dis?
TYROOOONE
and when you complete a room it fills it up 1/5 of the way
it has 5 charges, but the bar looks like one
rekt
My book of genesis got screwed up with the new update
okay time to crack open the files and see what to reskin
but apparently the resources method also works on plus if you've lost faith
yeah i don't have plus
replacing the old one
if on regular afterbirth
put it in resources folder
mKay
but i mean importing it into the game lol
well yeah of course
offset is color+constant
making the reskin
or is this not a modding question
if i were to make a simple reskin for regular afterbirth where should i start
what would offset mean in that case?
ty phort
yes, R G B A RO GO BO
I thiiink it's `Color(red, green, blue, alpha, redOffset, greenOffset, blueOffset)`.
red: (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)
they did change stuff
just kidding I updated
how 2 red xD ?
hmm
But it's actually `Color(float, float, float, float, integer, integer, integer)`, I think.
and I'm not just looking at MOI
RGB or Hex
or did very little change in the docs
is it just me
okay tbh it depends what he chose
but if I had to take a guess its Color( R, G, B )
Dunno
anyone knows how Color() works?
doesn't change though
the id of the trinket in the script which I want it to spawn
yes it's only the script which I change
steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\tools\LuaDocs
luamod doesn't refresh resources, only lua scripts
but if I change the id and only run luamod, it does not change
where can I find the updated ones?
if I change the trinket id and then relaunch the game, it spawns the other trinket
the code is to spawn a trinket, which works
also, luamod doesnt refresh stuff like items.xml
the ones on MOI arent updated yet
are any errors logged in the log file after refreshing?
is the code right tho
and yet my changes are not reflected
yeah I do that and it says success
command is "luamod modfoldername"
<@!152984637264756736> https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/index.html
there are none, but thanks
player.Damage = 1.5 + player.Damage
<@145740433165647873> try taking the spaces out of your folder name
Am I stupid?
```

end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_CACHE, mod.Evaluate)
```
i mean the issac api guide
hell yes
blog post!!!
theres people there
try cobalt streak's chat
does running luamod work to update their scripts for everyone else?
this is the only chat with people talking
not the actual reference but more concise
xd
http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
so does anyone/everyone else have the problem where they edit and save their lua script, reload the mod via the console, and yet apparently nothing changes?
can i have link to the lua reference guide
oh ok
i tried
it doesnt
doesnt lua have +=
every frame, get 0.001 damage up
works
player.Damage = 1.5 + player.Damage
theres a few of shitpost comments thats about it
Is the updated docs the same link as last time? I'm not seeing anything new
Great gieon just starts summoning sister vises
Just to see if the people that actually made the game can recreate something modders did
lasercolor...
I feel it would be hilarious to watch
And just see what they make
I would love to see Nicalis attempt to remake Antibirth from scratch, just by looking at what the bosses and everything does
well at least there is a comment
I like how the comment isn't even sure of the effect
Antibirth: We have a boss that breaks through a fucking wall
http://steamcommunity.com/games/250900/announcements/detail/248095310194829089
Nicalis: WE HAVE A BOSS THAT CHANGES INTO OTHER BOSSES
scroll up
oops wrong one
http://store.steampowered.com/app/570660/
?
:)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
we know
yea
THERES A NEW AP+ BUILD
?
GUYS
he just litteraly used all AIs and multiplied the spripts speed the lower the boss gets
Poorly, but has a concept
The end boss is lazily done, but at least it's concepted
I like how the update for ab+ just made everyone hate it even more
i hate him
oh my god
its such lazy work
because the end boss
I would kill u
That was a fun time
And discussing the endings with portal
if you will say the boss
is the uninstall button
The conspiracy theories
The best thing about ab+
>implying anything in this dlc isn't broken <:LUL:229765547787550720>
I'm so lost lol
Best not to touch modding api *period* tbh
<@135254843567767552> Ugh man. I need those GetCollectible and GetCollectibles functions

<@135254843567767552> WHAT?!
don't edit anything however, because you need the antibirth resources for basement renovator or you won't have any antibirth content after you save the stb again
But it doesn't have Antibirth content
i mean it's a rebirth mod so yeah
does basement renvator work in antibirth?
maybe someone else can figure out what to do with them with that information
i really, really hope that chronometrics updates it however
Rip
Or does it just die
as far as i'm aware the Config methods aren't properly implemented. traces of them can be found in the global table's ItemConfig class, but calling them crashes the game
no
Does basement renovator work in afterbirth+?
as far as i know yeah
Probably
Or whatever the fuck it's called
I need that itemlist lol
Bug fixes > API > Antibirth+
<@146600389779783680> Have you figured out how to use any Config methods at all?
I will freaking add a Salt Familiar to the game for everything that he has done wrong with the documentation
did they fix the isaac's awakening challenge yet?
i believe his priority list has api work after he makes corpse more interesting
yeah bug fixes is his main priority
And prs
Last I talked to him
He's on bug fixes apparently
<@146600389779783680> yes WTH
<@146600389779783680>  we all are
kil's working on it again though
antibirth api has been in the works since before ab+ but got canceled after ab+ got announced
const ItemList& Config::Config::GetCollectibles    (        )
If you cant notice Im very very vert Salty about him not adding how to use this garbage
Any ideas about this
http://i.imgur.com/0N98mXv.png mfw i see bad docs
yeah
***HAS SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOW***
wait theres an antibirth api in the works?
i *think*
Will antibirth api come with the basement renovator thingy?
why are you so pathetically lame
mfw shit api
http://i.imgur.com/9BhY25P.png
nicalis you actual clowns
amazing
lmao ok old modding method still doesnt disable achievements
i don't know about the room editor
you could add it in renovator
can you add gravity in the new one
I didn't figure it out
Idk
And you can only add some things
You add new room
it's unintuitive and ugly
me too
i hate the official one
basement renovator is so much better
how do they even use their room editor
Jer throwing shade like its high noon under a tree
ab+ modding tools in rebirth only game
and that would be even more cancer than character editor comments
the real ARG is finding out how to use the mod api
the api is too shit to support anything interesting
not to mention
u rite
even ironically
wai not
that requires using ab+
no
Make an Item Maker for AB+
maybe we should have a channel for "discoveries" on how to do stuff?
no
Do me a solid
this chat moves a million miles an hour
Jer
please
wouldn't be surprised, I still don't know though
show me
o.o
didn't that happen earlier today
didn't we already figure out how to add costumes though
costumes are the only thing im very salty about
thanks
http://i.imgur.com/KLD2zmQ.png
just take the ab+ method of doing things and don't add a costume
As all people not associated with antibirth just go *wow you can change stats dats neato*
no it'll be useful
but without a costume it wont be useful
thats neat
so you can add flight
REMAKE AN ITEM THAT ONLY CAUSES FLIGHT TO CAUSE FLIGHT
***OH MY GOD***
***WOW***
FATE
LORD OF THE PIT HYPE
SPIRIT OF THE NIGHT
UH
YOU CAN REMAKE
YOU CAN REMAKE
YOU CAN ADD FLIGHT
I thought you can alter stats now
not rlz
http://i.imgur.com/pLP9YuZ.png
HOLY SHIT WAIT
that's kinda cool i guess?
at least you can make shaders
Or better yet, if you're feeling bold, ***VERY SOON***
which I don't really
the update is not amaying
tilt shift would be useful to read if I cared about making a shader
so how is the update?
they truly give no fucks
The great words of tyrone
^
these docs are as capitalized as afterbirth item descriptions
Soon
I mean the shield trinket is the only useful one so far
soon
rip
oh alright
kil's a busy man
i honestly don't know
i don't know trust melon
Not just "pooping Monstro"
Mods disable achievements in a lot of games.
But the new sample mods have actual pratical stuff.
^ to portal
the sample mods are like nothing amazing but also nothing too bad
mods disable achievements
can I stop the donation machine from  jamming yet?
who wouldnt want pooping monstro
No jer I mean when will Antibirth like the game get updated with more of that juicy content
not rly
the sample mods are worthless
And the sample mods are helpful.
i have every right to criticize their subpar work
there's a few of them they're just not memes
i can criticize them for making *shit docs with comments that are only right 2% of the time*
wOAH
woohoo an actual comment http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/divhhi.png
i know no more than you do as far as api release
You can't criticize him for improving the game.
and i don't know when
it's more entertaining
Jer when is Antibirth+
i wish i knew
yeah it's a lot better
something is better than nothing, not worse :v
And he's going to continue to update it.
<@162156525337575425> who's the blind person that greenlit this
for Lua
Guys, at least this is somewhat better.
the entire dlc is about *some* lol
*some*
that's better than there not being any
but what about newcomers?
some of the descriptions are accurate
who made these
we know these are mistakes
http://i.imgur.com/6wSFfFf.png
no these are shittier
or "added for wiiu shutdown"
it's better it's just still bad
"for Lua"
like
but others
i mean some yeah
generated indeed lmao
these aren't generated
"***Generated*** comments for HTML documentation "
?
*updates documentation* **documentation somehow becomes shittier**
this is more entertaining than ab+
I am confused
dude
hahahahaha holy shit this is hilarious ?
haha ok that one is pretty good
It's pretty good http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/8auvva.png
thanks nicalis
excuse me what
nice documentation
http://i.imgur.com/pjsWcZl.png

My friends got wiped so I'm afraid to
hahahahahaaha
AMAZING DOCUMENTATION
back up to be safe
http://i.imgur.com/B5pTCJz.png
conditions unknown
it wipes some people's saves
it doesn't wipe saves
It wipes some saves
didnt wipe mine
people are trolling cobalt
At least the API is better.
it didnt wipe my save
those mods were already on the workshop
The update wipes saves?
he added a bunch of shit mods
EVERYONE'S TELLING COBALT THE UPDATE WIPES SAVES
mhm
OH HE DONE IT NOW
It's not missing a texture
saved as 64bit iamge?
explain this
http://i.imgur.com/2riF2CF.png
Well explosion texture
No
Missing bomb texture likely
a comment is one line further down that its supposed to be! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
rip
the usual
restarted steam already, verified cache etc
or that
that'll force update
fat vape clouds brah
just verify integrity
no don't restart
wtf is happening there
he is also aware of the ab+ api
restart steam for update
whoa
so how do i make explosions not look like this
i still haven't got the update
Antibirth was not official
trust jac is well aware of the state of the api
This is an **official expansion**
this sucks man
Why we are excited
Jac
wow you're, really excited by some pretty mundane stuff huh? :v
I CANT STAND THIS
Let's just agree that the API is still complete trash, but the fact that it will *apparently* be updated is good, and also you know the ability to make items that change player stats
WHAT THE FUCK EVEN
OH MY GOD
I think they put the comment for black hearts on eternal hearts by mistake
I
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
HOW
OH MY GOD
SOME DOCS HUH
HAHAHAHAHA WHAT
WOAH
What?
*GASP*
CAFFEINE PILL
wait for it
oh wow so you can remake...
like the worm
time to make a trinket that makes Isaac pulse
mmmm
?
you can also change Isaac's size
amazing
amazing documentation
think I'm overdoing it
http://i.imgur.com/spzvTnb.png
shit, all this staying up late and modding for the past 3 days, and I feel like I'm getting sick :S
it's an api that kilburn threw together in two weeks way before ab+ was announced and up until the stat changes update kil's api was more robust
we got hooks bois
YEAH
Okay
x3
how was this missing tho
"Added some methods to player to get joystick inputs"
antibirth has an api coming soon
yeah see
you can change stats now
any worthwhile changes besides the callbacks part?
...
less shit*
if you've done more than five minutes of coding this tells you nothing
She's negative because we are aware that a vastly better api coming out soon potentially
they still are shit
these docs are shit
the fact is
she's saying it how it is
xD
fuck off
she's not
<@162156525337575425> cmoon, dont be so negative!
it also lells you what i returns
#DreamAchieved
Can you modify all stats now?
no
Is a start
are literally on the scale of `int x; //declare variable`
Being able to modify tear stat
tbh most of these
woah actaul comments for callbacks
^
BETTER THAN NOTHING
oh callbacks
no they're not ok these are some lazy comments
they threw in generic comments
check ModCallbacks
no they're pretty shit
the docs are ok now
guys don't bother the docs are still shit
seems like EntityPlayer has a bunch of new functions?
which I try to fix
cuz I have crashes with my mod atm
k
ye
so we should still be good with "1"
none of hte mods I had have been marked "[OLD]" even after restarting a couple times
lets check out this generated comments meme

I'll check, mine already downloaded
mine's still loading with 1
does this mean we need to use the API version 2 now? or not
so wait
tyrone also implied you can make a whole new game with this so dont take his word for granted
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835650828
it's worth reiterating
Oops
https://puu.sh/tcFJX/0a4848220e.png
which does imply that the API is going to receive further updates
420
some of the annotated API sections say "TODO" on them
"nope! its broken! api is shit and will never do anything!"
HYPE
aaaand, the update is downloading
HE'S VERY WELL ALIVE AND HIS NAME IS EDMUND MCMILLEN
that's what it sounds like
https://puu.sh/tcFJX/0a4848220e.png
do they mean that they'll be further expanding the api
"To the brave intrepid Lua modders: We heard your criticism and we understand. It's still early days for the modding API. You can look forward to new possibilities as we open up access to more of the game's features and create more samples for you to base your mods on. We're still mostly focused on bug fixing at this time, so please be patient. This isn't even our final form!"
wow
GOD IS NOT DEAD
like
what was their idea for NOT putting that in
GOD

that sounds good
Made player stats modifiable by mods
Whoa wait we have comments now?!
wont make it nice, but it will make us empowered to do a lot more stuff
holy shit, the changelog actually sounds quite nice
the comments are still a bit barebones but there's more than none now
phew
took some time to program in but it's there and works
So I added an active item to the hiding of isaac
New patch is live.
OK
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834433846
SOME API HUH
YOU CAN REMAKE SAD ONION NOW
HEY GUYS
the balance notes are as vague as ever though
thank fucking god
http://steamcommunity.com/games/250900#announcements/detail/248095310194829089
do you have a link?
oh my god yes

<@154701703474577408> where have you got that pic from? oo
oh im late hahaha
GODBLESS
```Made player stats modifiable by mods ```
here we go boys
no. not really, i thinkhe got the config item from the TemporaryEffect class
"Added some missing entity casts: ToBomb, ToLaser, ToKnife 
Added some methods to player to get joystick inputs 
Made player stats modifiable by mods "
OH

"Generated comments for HTML documentation "
You know how to call from Config functions?
<@109624258317033472> it's a bitch but workable?
hey thas a nice update
<@122924009527574530> figured something about on that topic earlier that day
Config is a btich
etc
Config()
<@!152984637264756736> really? i mean, its not listed in the configuration
I've tried Config.Config.
but if I try Config.GetCollectibles or such it says Global nil etc
but I need a function that's listed under Config.Config
yeah
and it works
You know in the lua you can write Isaac.example() or Game().example() etc
Hey all I have a question for you:
i think that will work
player.FireCooldown
no
with a pill effect?
how?
i found how to change tear delay!!
guys!!!
thanks
Cheers

the resources folder? I don't see any xml files in there
<@72413153614368768> Hey how goes it. No progress. All fail.
Its in steamapps/common/ etc etc
yes
Oh you just mean the stock one from AB+
copy it
not sure
is there a way to get the updated items.xml
alright
<@108717851623374848> yes
Still can't figure out how to reroll items effectivly
I give up for now
can mods be installed manually like in rebirth / afterbirth
Ah man this is too hard
Idk
Oh make?
Trap rooms
... he didnt ask for an enemy, he wants to know how to make one
what
¯\_(?)_/¯
<@109624258317033472> red spike blocks
is there an updated items.xml?
for now the only thing I can do is item art
Well, I really wish I could apply costumes
Does anyone know how to make an custom entity NOT required to be killed to finish the room?
xD
who did this
? ? ?
?
?
i copied the whole calculator
oops
go to <#207259602969034753>
bad
Hi only60secondsmultipliedby60minutesmultipledby12
he is just invis
mine doesnt
why
we need to go deeper
?
Hi only60minutesmultipledby12
:(
but it crashes on start
i made the invisible character
hi hi
Hi Only13Hours
ShakeScreen()
I love screen cake!
i found a screen shake
is their other shaders
(makes it brightere)
for the angel one its Game():Darken(-1, 20)
:o
Game():Darken(1, 20)
<@266032468853915650>  how did you do the spooky darkness effect?
also, x-lax's effect is immediately shat on the ground, when LEMON PARTY grows
nice one <@266032468853915650>
Edmund Mc Milen likes ur stuffs
Wait, so Azazel doesn't use Lord of the Pit at all?
Nice
thats what pm2k actually said
pretty much
aferbets isnt ported to ab+ because ab+s sprites are horrible enough to fit right in
ITS A DREAM COME TRUE
it's funky
try taking lazarus' rags as azazel
I guess costumes for items still werent figured out, eh?
costume
nope
Those wings are specific to his item animation, I thought
has the binning off isek: aferberts been ported to afterbirth+ yet
mhm
probs cause of the spritesheet

Is there a way to make costume sets right now?
SHHHH
~~and everything else~~
I only use character editor for synergies
So is that just part of it?
I'm not seeing it in the file- his costume is set to his head
yuyp
isaac character editor meme

^
its just a costume set in players.xml
How is Azazel set up in a way that he starts with Lord of the Pit's effects and costume, but not the item itself?
I really hope that the update in a few hours makes me a sandwich
they'll probs fix the stats shit atleast
still applies
"work"
well. Viable doesnt mean good. just means one can do anything with it
after a year of work i doubt it'll be made viable in 2 mere days
i really hope the update in a few hours makes the API viable
i really hope the update in a few hours makes stats viable
dunno
i really hope the update in a few hours fixes this shit
Can you set a character to have more than one costume in players.xml?
wait. that makes him super fast. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK NICALIS? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
lets set friciton to 1 fucking million! hoorey
i just set my familiar to 0 friction and was wondering why it stopped moving at all ?  GG
that's nicalis
because the opposite is the case right now
shouldnt low friction REDUCE the amount entities get slower when they hit walls?
what dhat

double x-lax
then you got pills that are insanely useless
double lemon party!
double bad trip
double health down
yea but
hard but fair truth
double tears up and doble health up tho
<@126426442555719680> thats a terrible trinket
explosive diarrhea dropping 10 bombs
Now it gives me 2 hearts
Addicted already giving me an extra heart of damage
10/10 pickup
balanced item
hell yea
die instantly
?
you get hit twice with bad trip
keep in mind it can fuck you over majorly
aw hell yea
sounds kinda poweful for an trinket
a trinklet that doubles pill effects, y/n?
or are costumes like Blue Baby on a new Save File/Judas on a new Save File/Cain on a new Save File
any progress on costumes?
soo
seems to be par for the course
:S
not optimal tho
you could always go hacky and add it when HasCollectible(youritem) first returns true.
and I posted earlier how to add a costume to a character
I saw the trinity mod
havent seen anyone getting costumes to work yet
seems to be two different xml files
how do you connect a costume with an item?
also, is the SpawnSeed for every Room different?
have not tried yet, but what was the problem with just adding it to the itemroom.xml?
anyone been able to change item pools?
or any eoom
enter a room with enemies
hmm
Is there a way to know when one enters a room besides looking at the room id?
Can you get coin counts easily?
omg
does anyone know if there is a mod for antibirth music in AB+
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835593074&searchtext=
i found heaven
i know but nothing for AB+ yet.
download one of those and see what they did is my best advice
There are some mods on the workshop for custom challenges
im gonna ask one more time before i go look elsewhere. anyone know anything about custom challenges?
yes
<@134478547795443712> win streak: 2
as soon as it loads...
better?
fuck yes
edmund retweeted my new mod!
Check PlayerType enum?
my friend wants me to make music note tears
he also changed the color but idk if that's relevant
custom tears like bone tears or tooth tears
it dose look like a booty
hahah
Someone made tears which could destroy rocks with sustained fire, but I have no clue how he could've done that without it being hackish
What do you mean by "custom tears"
lmao my old sprite really does look like a butt with toilet paper
has anyone made custom tears
wait
It's a sketch, he's going to downsize it and draw the outline then
its a sketch
uh, just use double outlines <@266032468853915650>
im still trying to figure out if anyone knows anything about custom challenges. and yes that looks great man
new sketch, opinions?
hah I can imagine
surprising nobody, only moving by jumping actually makes the game very difficult >_>
man. would be nice if we could hook user input
do any of us know how to add costumes
tbh I'd probably just make it look like the mini monstro enemy :p
I don't know how to apply costumes yet so I haven't bothered making a pedastel sprite
that's what happens when you only release one example mod with no documentation
Lol yep
I like how so many of us are using Pyrokinesis as a placeholder
that's sweet
I'm monstro
http://i.imgur.com/H31q5QU.gifv
Function to get player #?
does the luarun command work
new sprite

so I guess what I said isn't really true lol
Hmm possibly
no hue change
no I used the color palette
could you destroy all tear projectiles that belong to the player every frame?
Does anyone know of a way to disable the player's regular attack?
did you change it by changing the hue?
<@266032468853915650> It's how the bible and book of revelations look too but I guess I can adjust it
yum yum
yes.
is that a cookie?
made a better sketch :b
all of my characters are invisible
ok uhh,
i know.
(its a fortune cookie)
it looks like a depressed butt with a tag.
bottom left of the sprite looks kinda weird
also
Yeah that's neat.
thats cool
shit man
That's pretty good
Hey.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5mae6t/new_mod_the_book_of_genesis/
I released my second mod
here's all of them
wow they must seem legit since you thought they were from antiberf
i made them
no
are demon heart, heretic, and fortune cookie from antibirth <@266032468853915650> ?
got the devil precedent to work http://pastebin.com/s45PnQMY
<@!182509747835109387> greenisaac
So my judgement isnt exactly great
Still doesn't take the item back, I thought I fixed it, but I was wrong 6 times

```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", 1 )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
timerv = -1

function dash:timer( )
    timerv = -1
    if timerv ~= -1 then 
        timerv = timerv + 1
    end
    if timerv == 120 then
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        timerv = -1
    end
end

function dash:use_dash( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    timerv = 0
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, dash.timer);
```
and I think you mean table
but why would you have a list
yes
#nameoflist
<@!182509747835109387> just use the edited .stb files?
just, any list
Is there any way to port rooms edited with Basement Renovator to AB+?
hm
which list
list?
how can I get the length of a list?
((i hope))
(that's a joke)
what if the documentation is locked behind a new arg
I think
oh cool
how?
it's GetCollectible(15)
got it
does anyone here know anything about custom challenges
I understand <@266706294306635776> .. not sure, no idea yet
"bit more help"
more like any help at all
<@!194259969359478784> Kappa
little more help
I need something like Collectibles(15).type == 1
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/817117796584673280
I can't just type 15.type == 1
Like say I know the item ID I want is 15
what you mean
didn't understand
what
I guess I need to use the collectibles enumerator?
Like, how do I get at the object for the item I mean
In my code, how can I check a given item's type
no idea why
Hmm <@120355885615808512> how do I use Config?
although you still can't do damage up/down
finally. yo got a question bout custom challenges
and since stat down/stat up pills have different effects, you could do it over and over again until you have the desired stat up/down
which is kinda like changing stats
What *can* we do for now
you can do pill effects
Dead
no <@124248443383185408>
there are nearly no functions that return tables
just checking every item works
How about items that change stats/
something in EntityPlayer maybe?
not possible
any thoughts?
How about getting a list of picked up items?
That should work
we've been making items since the DLC released
what?
Did we figure out how to make an item?
Yeeeesssss
```enum      ItemType { 
  ITEM_NULL = 0, ITEM_PASSIVE = 1, ITEM_TRINKET = 2, ITEM_ACTIVE = 3, 
  ITEM_FAMILIAR = 4 
}```
you have to check the ItemType
found it
make a check on the item, see if it can be rerolled
ooh
but I did find a CanReroll
There's Item stuff in the Config class but I have no idea how the Config class works
can't find any IsActive
yeah
and also that's really tedious lol
I could, but I'd like to have it be future proof as well
could you manually exclude the item IDs of all the vanilla active items and have it roll again if it rolls one of those?
maybe you can check the charges
or was it hasactive .. damn
okay I'll check
im pretty sure there is a IsActive function
<@120355885615808512> how can I check if it's an active item? I will simply tell it to keep trying until it's not an active item
check if it's an active item and then spawn the active item your holding on the ground and then replace it <@266706294306635776>
not moves the head somewhere else, but like makes it invisible or something?
scissors?
(i 100% butchered the name)
guillotine?
shears?
do you know what item removes the head from the character?
eyy
<@266032468853915650> Looks awesome
And since I'm using RNG, it'll be the same every time(on the same seed with all of the same actions done up do that point)
niice
Yup.
Okay cool
You are just checking all the items at random until it finds one the player has
Ah I get it now
And yeah, the active bit is kinda annoying
Oh I see
It should be removing a random item, not the first item picked up
which replaces it lol
and also it can give an active item
IT'S WORKING BOIIISSSS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkBEhxrTyF8&feature=youtu.be
it removes the first picked up not the most recently picked up
Ah, I figured out what the "proper" way to check if firing is
two problems lol
that's nice
Got it pseudoworking
<@72413153614368768> OKAY now we're getting somewhere!
you dont need player in MC_POST_UPDATE
I'm going to end up making a bunch of items and keep playing with them myself lol.
wtf
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", 1 )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function timer( )
    local timer = -1
    if timer ~= -1 then 
        timer = timer + 1
    end
    if timer == 120 then
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        timer = -1
    end
end

function dash:use_dash( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    timer = 0
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, timer );
```
<@186331772412231681> Would this fix it?
okay cool
oh
Oh, you set up a table of high, med and so forth items?
typed it in discord
where
see the item effect
what did you do?
Item: "Reckoning"
Description: "Divine judgement befalls on you!"
Effects: Gives you 2 medium tier or 1 good tier devil/angel item depending on your precedent.
Added: In the game, no effect.
need it for this
i repeat myself, is there a way to find devil precedent?
niice
FINALLY DONE
GetCollectibleRNG()
one sec
I think we need to use this method to get the id
if that's allowed in lua
but now this lol:
 bad argument #2 to 'AddCollectible' (number expected, got no value)
Alright.
Ah, that's how you do it?
yea
fixed
just local RNG = RNG()
Aah
I hadn't declared RNG
you have to create an RNG object
Anyone knows how to make something disappear (a familiar) when you enter the next room?
Cause RNG:RandomInt(max) is a function
Hm... What line does it say it's on?
Odd
<@72413153614368768> okay found this error causing an exception: attempt to call a nil value (method 'RandomInt')
```Level.GetCurseName()```
how do i use this properly ? anyone knows ?
That's why I was wondering
i don't think checking for 0 would work because of items like razor blade
Should be next to your mods folder
Your Afterbirth+ save folder
Hmm, where do I find such a thing?
What's in your log.txt?
rip
<@72413153614368768>  So I tested it! As of now it does nothing lol
Would passive items have a charge of nil or 0?
I'm not sure how that works
you could just manually exclude the IDs of all the actives
Config::Item?
How would you tell what the MaxCharges is?
i mean, if there's a way to check the ID of the item it's giving
Possibly.
maybe from MaxCharges
Can you tell if an item's an active?
this'd be a pain but couldn't you reroll the number if it's the ID of an active item
and it can give you actives, since again, i don't think you can tell if an item's an active
is there any way to find devil precedent?
since as far as i know there's no way of checking to see how many items there are
I use player:GetMovementDirection() similarly to see if any movement key is being pressed
this only works on vanilla items, btw
<@72413153614368768>  awesome I'll give it a go
Ahhh, good idea! thanks.
if the direction returns -1 then no fire button is held
<@132604813731954688> I *think* testing player:GetFireDirection() would check for that
has*
tell me if it ahs an error
but it should work
this code's untested
<@266706294306635776> https://hastebin.com/raw/wapoxokahe
work
hard
Hah. Needs a check for curse of the blind :p
that mod is sooo cheaty XD
So, does anyone know if there's a way to check if the player is firing?
Thanks for the autocomplete link
doesn't have everything but it helps a bunch
yup
fuckin awesome
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m8qfe/api_autocompletion_for_zerobrane_studio/
Oh shit, did they?
Yeah. So nice being able to set breakpoints
someone also added autocompletion to it
yup ZeroBrane is the shit
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lw81j/you_can_attach_a_debugger_to_your_lua_code/
alright
The best solution in my opinion is getting ZeroBrane and using it's debugger functions. It helps a lot
<@72413153614368768> no problem at all, I'm just glad someone is helping ?
it has very hard limitations and you should be able to print there.
jesus
<@266706294306635776> sorry for taking so long, had to go afk for a sec. i'll have it in a min or two
lol nope
print doesn't print to console?
well the console is bs in general
there isn't, you have to make a file and edit it, save it, then run luarun with the file path
pretty sure there is
i wish there was a way to run lua straight from console rather than making files
just the closest one since i cant change the size of texts. if i could to that i would do multiple
<@102194039104737280> I don't know, I just discovered this like 5 minutes ago
does it work in shops/devil deals, or only with pedestals?
or just make it show the item you're closest to
are you gonna do it like you were planning to in like different corners and shit
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
lel
<@162156525337575425>  here are multiple items XD
like, is that a thing you'd be able to do
<@122924009527574530> could you add a new costume and specify this code to only be running if you have a new passive item
it works with multiple items, but their texts overlap right now XD i will make it, that the nearest item to the player will be displayed, because it needs a lot of space to display just one item right now
does it work with multiple items or not yet? still great job tho
Is there a way to check if the player is shooting?
finally working ? thank you all for helping me out with it ?
enjoy
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5ma1jp/how_to_add_a_costume_to_isaac_without_adding_the/
Cool cool can't wait ?
I'm writing a code mockup rn
or what is your theory anyway
<@72413153614368768> what do you call to remove or add passive items at random?
breakfast
So permanent curse of the blind? nty
<@102194039104737280>  haha chaos v2
every frame reroll a random item
passive item
I was stuck for a while on "deal damage to everything near isaac" until debug text revealed that an enemy standing almost right next to isaac has a distancesquared value of 1000 and only does contact damage when it reaches about 600, which is much higher than I was expecting :v
Yeah it's active
Yeah, but maybe we can start with random
i'm assuming this is an active item?
most recent item would be harder
okay, i think i can get it so that you can remove a random item
hm...
what I don't yet know how to do is automatically assign it to a character and add that character to the select screen, but people have made a start on half of that
things that don't exist in the API like character creation and setting stats aren't going to magically pop out of nowhere without some kind of update
<@72413153614368768> That may be possible and you have some idea? Or just it may be possible ?
so far I've manged to implement most of the functionality of the mod I was planning to make first, documentation or not
well being in denial about something obviously not being in there is also not very constructive
<@102194039104737280> like i said before, there may be functions that are not fully understood, but the names make it quite clear as to what is possible and what isnt based on class definitions
It's the last thing I need to implement lol
<@70946604139425792> going on about how bad it is not as constructive as giving details on what is and what isn't possible
Awesome
that may be possible
Yup
okay, so most recently item picked up?
but I don't even know how to reroll
i don't think we have anywhere near a full understanding of what the api is/isn't capable of yet
Really I want to reroll the most recently picked up one
If people honestly want to try making a fully-fledged mod in this abortion of an API, they need to know their limitations
saying "it's worthless" isn't helping anyone, because there *are* things it *can* do :v
Random basically
<@126426442555719680> Talking about what the API can't do *does* help people
are you rerolling a specific item or just a random item from your inventory?
Like how the D4 works
what do you mean?
it'll get better guys dont worry
okay, we get it, it sucks, but that's not helping anyone
I'm trying to figure out how to reroll an already picked up item
? ?
what's your problem?
it'll surely get better ?
<@72413153614368768>  maybe we can start by discussing the problem I'm working on?
yo fucking STOP
nine ninety nine us dollars for a broken unfinished api
What matters **now** is that it's worthless
<@102194039104737280> Again, it doesn't matter if it may potentially end up getting unfucked later because it's fucked **now**, we have no context for what it'll be like in two months but that doesn't matter
Just let them be
Stop answering them
*Gives KyoZM popcorn*
can we stop arguing about whether or not the api is useful or not and start figuring out how to do stuff with it
like I said, this channel is going to be useless for the next week
<@70946604139425792> that's fair but that doesn't justify acting like it's permanently useless
this will never stop being funny
http://i.imgur.com/tqfxw3j.png
eyy https://youtu.be/dwu0t6gC31M
? ?
mmm yummy
we're living in now
<@124088844181045249> "The API might be unfucked later" doesn't excuse it being fucked **now**, because we aren't living in later
?
*hands FlipskiZ ?*
<@102194039104737280> no
you guys are the kind of people who say LOL MOD TOOLS WILL FIX IT on the subreddit
#DramaAlert
Yo, can I get some of that popcorn too <@175392549035442177>? I'm kinda hungry
im triggered because you guys are systematically denying the fact that the api doesn't exist, instead you are saying "oh it's just broken or we don't know how to do it"
whats the point?
Listen: I don't care if it's worthless or not. I just want to try one fucking thing right now
everyone stop feeding them, we're just making them talk more lol
why do you have to be so fucking delusional
What's the point?
?
Why do you have to be so fucking toxic
i never even bought NMS
the denial is blinding
and the people who dont think its worthless are the same types of people who played too many hours of NMS that they couldnt refund it
wow we really need some rain huh?
yes
its fucking worthless isnt it
alright so how about this API
ok im staying then
<@162156525337575425>
<@162156525337575425> good riddance <3
<@162156525337575425>
dont ping me bastard
<@162156525337575425>  goodbye
the whining of isaac ;/
you're not doing anything productive by bitching anyway
behavior like that is why we won't get anywhere with this api
I know people want to take potshots but it makes the discussion for people who actually want to make mods a bit difficult
enjoy your delusions
this channel is going to be pretty useless for advice for at least another week or more tbh
whatever im out
Man there should be another channel for arguing about whether or not the API is useful
and/or unfinished
broken like this entire API
you're delusional if you think its hidde somewhere
I can't see how you can't realize that it might be broken currently
1. You need to AddCollectibleEffect and then GetCollectibleEffect and then get Item from the effect to then AddCostume
there are getters but not setters
something i made worked
the api flat out does not have anything that can change stats
why are you in such denial
i'm about to cry tears of joy
i don't see how i have to explain how it is a hack if the main menu screen glitches out when you select the motherfucking character
i don't see how that's a "hacky" method when it's literally the most basic way of doing it
That doesnt mean anything we dont know how to do is impossible forever
whats unknown?
We have been given a fuckton of tools and no instruction on how to use them
They had to specifically add that function
i put a players.xml inside of my mod
The fact that we can hack in a player is enough proof that it is possible
Thats literally unknown
it's not even editing the existing players.xml
OK I found the issue
how is using players.xml a hack
YOU CANT EVEN CHANGE STATS WITH THE API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
hacking a character in with players.xml is not equal to adding a customizable character through the api. the api to make a customizable character or to edit existing characters does not exist.
I've got a more specific problem lol
<@126426442555719680> Yeah I checked them out, and I've done all that part basically
right there
we don't know what 95% of this shit does
literally a new character
How are you so bloody sure?
<@158076359220920320> did you not even take a fucking look at my video
we don't know that
<@266706294306635776> there's some tutorials on the modding of isaac reddit
i've stated this multiple times but you somehow still are not understanding. nothing is broken here. character creation simply doesn't exist. it can't be broken if it doesn't exist in the first place
Really just need some help with the API
and yeah, it's fun to mess around with
But I never had any expectations in the first place
even if it's hacky
it's shit, but we can still do stuff with it
Personally I'm enjoying my time with the API
tbh i'm happy we got a modding api in the first place
Anyone know where I can go to get a little help with making a mod?
nicalis shits all over the api thats for sure
yeah shit happens
Sure, it should have worked from the beginning. But shit happens
give time for something that is modding support in a DLC for a DLC for nine ninety nine us dollars?
give it some time
The mod tools have been out for 2 days ffs
And you can create an item
you cant even have different stats for characters
There is no information about items.xml on the documentation
and this character making is worthless
Because apparently it exists
Apparently you're wrong then
that's because you don't create characters with lua
there is no room for understanding or misunderstanding this
all of that was done by adding a players.xml and putting stuff in resources
you don't have to not be able to understand the documentation for creating a new character, because there is no documentation to misunderstand/understand. the documentation for creating a new character literally _doesn't exist_ because the functions _don't exist_ to do so
is there any thing to detect whether a player enters on a new room?
https://streamable.com/v48g8
the documentation clearly states that there is no way to add a new character into the game
<@102194039104737280> They're pessimistic because they have done nothing but fiddle with the API for the last two days, they are rightfully unoptimistic
btw
not being delusional != pessimistic
fuck off with your "pessimistic"
speaking as someone who's been bitching about the lack of documentation for the past 2 days, don't be so pessimistic
^^^^^
to do the most basic fucking shit
doing anything with this API is hacks on top of hacks
no there wont be an easy-ish way, if there was it'd be obvious
uploading an example character right now
i guarantee once we actually have an understanding of the API there'll be an easy-ish way to add players
cause there is one file that contains the images for the menu
<@162156525337575425>  thats my fan character "poopoo peepee man"
you have to edit the anim2 i think
Which means there should be some support for it
Yeah, players.xml
you can hackily add in a players.xml but its just a blank character in the menu
IT WORKS
yep just saw that...
<@124088844181045249> please point me to the function in question, because afaik it doesn't exist
<@134478547795443712> missing an end after the last else?
i call him "poopoo peepee man"
you nerds are misunderstanding jack
Don't be too pessimistic about the API
but it crashes when you play it
<@158076359220920320> i made a character!
There is
it doesn't exist
<@102194039104737280> there is literally no way to create a new player
Anyone have any idea how to reroll a passive item the player already picked up?
Hey <@266706294306635776>
<@134478547795443712> Checked the log file?
Hey all!
oh god this sucked
local adam = math.random(0, 6)
  if adam == 1 then
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BROTHER_BOBBY, false)
  elseif adam == 2 then
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_LITTLE_STEVEN, false)
  elseif adam == 3 then
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_LIL_LOKI, false)
  elseif adam == 4 then
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_INCUBUS, false)
  else
    player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_CUBE_OF_MEAT, false)
this code is throwing an error somewhere:
!!!!
I HAVE FUCKING FOUND HOW TO ADD COSTUMES
it's that we have no idea how to do anything because we don't know what the fuck anything does
math should be automatically included
it's not that "this stuff is all impossible with the current api"
Nah
no its lua
to use the math functions
do you need to import the math library
I just realized I might be an idiot
wait
it's like NMS in dlc form
but we cant
they said that we could do a lot of shit from the api
it literally just doesn't exist, and it won't
it's not broken
It's probably just broken rn
>fix
yeah
Give them a few weeks to fix their shit
"That the community will inevitably make" they said
does anyone know what addcacheflags does
"Completely new games" they said
yep
the api dosnt support f*cking anything
i seriously doubt the api supports player creation
But well, we should be able to do a lot
I don't think anyone has figured it out properly yet though
We should be able to, at least
Ofc are we even able to create characters right now?
Sounds interesting
<@133659541198864384> i hope you're dancing with metatables
So all you have to do is make a displayed health, hide your hearts, and make it so that whenever you get hit it subtracts from the "fake" HP depending on the damage of the entity that hits you
Good point
Right
Do they?
Since otherwise charm wouldn't work
Since enemies and enemy tears already have damage
Or well, the damage that all enemies give off
If just costmetically change hearts to numbers though, should work fine
Not really
If you mean the same type of health that enemies have, you would need to redo the whole game
ecept numbas!!
there would be a difference
Probably wouldn't work that well
I just thought of an idea for a character - a character with numerical health instead of hearts
Medium Tier:
    Celtic Cross
    Censer
    Crown Of Light
    Dead Dove
    Habit
    Guardian Angel
    Lazarus' Rags
    Rosary
    Seraphim
    Sworn Protector
    The Relic
    The Soul
    Holy Grail

High Tier:
    The Wafer
    Trinity Shield
    Godhead
    The Halo
    The Body
    Sacred Heart
    Holy Mantle
    Holy Light!
this about right?
it doesn't work
my problem is that, somewhere between my randomizer function and when I put that into the final function
I've gotten it to work with familiars by putting their name directly in the addcollectibleeffect function
and paste the players xml thingy
that's not my issue
ok go in your content folder
player:GetEffects():AddCollectibleEffect(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_CEREMONIAL_ROBES, false)
yea doesn't work plumbus
<@!152984637264756736> what's your code
im trying to nerf him
sounds op
and when you play it the game crashes :9
its invisible
nice
i made a void character!!
woah!!!
for this
I'm not trying to use a costume
wait no, not working
costume works?
I'm trying to spawn a random familiar from a pool of five
my problem isn't the costume
ya pastebin
the pastebin is not
well the thing I just posted is
fucking thing doesnt work
I've been battling with costumes all day
thought so
no
plumbus is that working code?
if player:GetDamageCooldown() == 0 then
    player:TakeDamage(2, DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS, EntityRef(player), 0)
    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_HALF_SOUL, pos, vel, player)
  end
<@134478547795443712> how did you manage to do the box cutter so you cant use it when you are invulnerable?
when you stop moving, all enemies freeze but you are unable to shoot
I think I'm inputting this into the bottom function wrong
there, its working now
bye
http://pastebin.com/00EDMzc2
cy'all tomorrow tho
But you can edit it for other mods, as it's all in a shared env
I'd guess the userdata Lua uses sets the variables, not the C++ reads variables from the Lua userdata
Prolly not Necro
i give up for now. i just copy the content of the file into the main.lua -.-
just curious, could I completely screw the API using meta-tables?
nvm then
Oh, okay
that is OBS
Most streamers and a good deal youtubers
Can't do it currently not on my PC
yeah Wofsaufe use that and add log(package.path) at the end to see lua's origin path.
It's what basically everyone uses
Have you tried OBS?
eyy testing new recording software
It adds a global `log` function and displays the log on-screen
Protip: if you want to log stuff inside the game without using external applications, just load this mod: ```lua
local mod = RegisterMod("LogMod", 1);

local _log = {}

function log(...)
    local args = {...}

    for _, v in ipairs(args) do
        table.insert(_log, tostring(v))
    end
end

local function onRender(t)
    local min = math.max(1, #_log-10)
    for i = min, #_log do
        Isaac.RenderText(_log[i], 50, 20+(i-min)*10, 1, 1, 0.9, 1.8)
    end
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, onRender);

log("LogMod Initialized")```
<@!226519543588192256> in your sample code earlier, you were checking the timer in your use item function, but the use item function isn't called every frame
I know you can get the boolean, but I am nore sure how you would modify it
don't worry, i've done the same thing plenty of times haha
I don't know how to log in the mod API. haven't worked with it yet.
And sorry for that again
I'm going mad, g'night y'all
I even saw the question mark
I read that as a question
I really should go to sleep
Sorry for that
Fuck me
<@133659541198864384> how do i implement that into the mod file ? it outputs nothing when i just put it in
ffs
oh
saw that
There's literally an `EntityPlayer.CanShoot()` function
yeah
<@213504838103859200> Have you even checked the reference?
ffs
This is a loosely-fuckin-typed language with multiple return values and where half of what you'll be doing is tables
there is a function that returns whether or not the player can shoot
returns in c++ make me want to die a little
that's very convenient
Whatever those are
Returns a, b and c
`return a, b, c`
Well
shooting
okay, now how would I prevent the palyer from shooing
Have a function return an object
What do you mean by that?
how to return object in lua?
what does print(package.path) output? this shows where lua paths are based.
wait who was the person who made the demon heart item here
<@124088844181045249> As a note on that, it's [0, 1), like almost every other function you'll find
Appears to be [min, max]
$$eval local s = "" for i=1, 10 do s = s .. "," .. math.random(1, 5) end print(s)
```
Output:
,3,2,3,1,3,3,1,5,1,3

```
so you get everything in between 0-1
And if you want a float in addition, add  math.random()
actually, I can just test I guess
k
<@133659541198864384> when i make doFile it says "No such file or directory"
Yeah
for both?
includes the number I believe
ya
Is it integer?
or [lower, upper)
math wise
or (lower, upper]
(lower, upper)
is the math.random()
<@207634020354359296> the money the person got from the lawsuit was used to buy a plane.

So they did get wings from red bull
Wofsauge just use dofile?
<@174193097285173250> From what I know the lua path is currently borked
I guess
<@134478547795443712> `EntityPlayer:GetCollectibleRNG()` and the like
anyone got a a require file working ?
```
require "secondfile.lua"
```
nah it's similar to monster manuel
Otherwise the player can randomise by shooting tears I guess
...but out of curiosity, how would you use a seed?
**Don't** use the RNG if you're doing something like shooting tears
probably won't need to be seeded
What I was going to say
Yeah
nah it's a pretty tame random element
Shooting random tears for example don't need a seed
Don't use that if you want to, say, reroll items
Well, depends what you want to do
yeah. math.random(lower, upper)
I mean
guys
math.random(range)
well there is lua math.random
That's not gonna be seeded
I just use math.random from lua itself
Though `RandomInt(max)` exists
You don't set a range, you calculate it I guess
how do I use the random number generator? How do I set a range?
Or maybe item charges
So speed
And it's an energy drink
so its a refrence to that
Yeah, I know
and some1 sued em for it
because red bull said it would give u wings on the can
no it gives you wings
As a mod
Why not?
Quite nice idea, fun one
no im jk
lol
And be a speed up
since a bull is a male cattle and a cow is a female cattle
*wiiiiiiiings
it seems to immediately freeze the game hard
there should be an item called Red Cow that gives you wings
no
I mean the actual function call
I've gotten ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM to work
has anyone successfully used UseActiveItem
forever
jesus christ every time you send a message I read it in anthony fantano's voice
I also just got my temporary-familiar mod working so I'm going to make another release
yeah I know! super excited
and now it says the mod is old
ed retweet your tweet plum ?
I was wondering why no one was around
I've been in the wrong text channel for over an hour
I've only now realized
I think....
you edit the tears sprite
anyone knows how to change the color of the tears?
player:UseActiveItem(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_D10, false, true, false, false); -- this kills the game
frame*
every second it sets timer to -1
third don't use variables with the same name as functions
or second i guess
^
timer is a local variable
2nd
ok first
dash:timer
1st
Active item gives belt, should take it away after 2 seconds, but doesn't
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", 1 )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function timer( )
    local timer = -1
    if timer ~= -1 then 
        timer = timer + 1
    end
end

function dash:use_dash( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, false)
    timer = 0
    if timer == 120 then
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        player:RemoveCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT)
        timer = -1
    end
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, timer, player );
```
Mod now gives item!
But it doesnt take away item...
its an invisible character
fuffles made a hd lost
hey
I think someone did
I looked at something real quick and made a wrong conclusion, noone has made a new character
i'm back bois
Actually, you can do `LengthSquared`
`Isaac.GetPlayer(0).Velocity:Length()<0.1` or something
No
idk
has anyone successfully made a new character?!?!/1/1!?!?1!?!?1!?!
Lemme check if the L is uppercase
Hold on
thats very simple shit
tried that too, doesnt work
like
`player.Velocity`
no
no
dude
so obvsiouly I need to do player.GetMovementDirection
trying to get a passive to work only when you are moving
?
yeah I dont know how to get this to work
not me.
big smoke
we need to sacrifice soemone to our lord and savior
it's thursday my dudes
For example
BombVariant.BOMB_HOT
Like a table
like an array?
how are enums used
yes
this is going to seem dumb
we need an ocean man mod
regular satan cause hes weak
and unlocks and ...
Is Tyrone regular Satan or Mega Satan?
edmund is papa jesus
xd
tyrone is satan amirite
The pilleffect trick works for some things, but. it's definitely not ideal
tyrone's the reason why africans starve to death
the world would be a better place
Yeah.
we need stats asap
haha
I really need to write a script that just automatically nukes update.it when it pops up
yeah
<@266032468853915650> Eve/Polaroid value though!
<@!95444500364660736> your mod makes devil deals really hard to get xd
I think my syntax is completely wrong, that has got to be it
I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get the direction check to work
<@105465854551937024> Niice, thanks. Knew there was something off
you cant?
I saw that Kyo, that's why I asked!
you dont
code*
where do u find already existing codes
It works!
<@70946604139425792> https://twitter.com/CustomPhase/status/817104596506185729
might help
change the last value to a boolean
Thought I'm a bit confused by too much JS recently
Prety sure it doesn't
might aswell put the bool
not sure if lua reads 0 as false
player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, true)
The value is `true`
And I have no clue what userdata is this
EntityPlayer has a userdata as a metatable key
ab+ modding tools
Y'know what irks me
```
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <active description="WOOSH!" gfx="Collectibles_Dash.png" maxcharges="1" name="Dash" />
</items>
```
how does your items.xml look?
?
But I've been doing that a lot lately
I see literally no errors
i think its teh same n the docs
Yeah, it makes you take red heart damage first.
idk who said it but here are proper direction enums http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/zmfv84.png
spirit heart protection
0h
what is it
...
what does it do
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", 1 )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )

function dash:use_dash( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, 0)
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
```
kek

i think i've debugged enough lol
yea
It also runs when you run `luamod`, useful for debugging
idk
What is wrong with me today
the code on the top only runs when you open the game
put that on the start of your function
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
http://www.moddingofisaac.com/docs/index.html where in here would i find enemies
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( Dash, 1 )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function dash:use_dash( )
    local  VelBupdate =  player.GetVelocityBeforeUpdate()
    player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, 0)
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
```
Still does literally nothing
but thats retarded
you can do UsePill(PillEffect.SPEED_UP)
hold on
I just realised something
or AddLuck. AddSpeed. AddTearDelay. etc.
erm
how does one forget player:AddDamage when making an API jesus
Hello
Eyo.
eyy its shawn
<@!152984637264756736> If you have any syntax errors or what not, it'll do that. Look in the log.txt file for Isaac and it'll show you
Happened just now to me, it was my syntax
it also disables the mod if it has
it could have synax errors
does it have 1 on registermod
ok why dose ap+ keep marking my mod as old
best bit of code this API can do
Thanks for the help!
I was basing it off of the example mods, which actually use the wrong sytax in some places. But most of it was a forgetful mind
works like a charm
if math.random() > 0.5 then
        Game():Darken(-1, 17)
        print("[ItemExpansion] Angel Reckoning!")
      else
        Game():Darken(1, 17)
        print("[ItemExpansion] Devil Reckoning!")
      end
Also, has anybody here used `Vector.Lerp` successfully?
(Unless it works anyways)
So. Anything new on the stats front?
4. `RegisterMod( "Dash", 1 )`, it's not a string
OK, I forgot a lot of stuff
the lecture is real
3. not `COLLECTIBLE_BELT`, but `CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_BELT`
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
the slow value in the Addslow function doesn't seem to do anything
2. `player:GetVelocityblahblah`, you want to call in on the player
idk what youre trying to do
huh
1. `player` is nil
Both are fine, the docs are shit
1st, remove the quotes in the 1
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", "1" )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )

function dash:use_dash( )
    local  VelBupdate =  player.GetVelocityBeforeUpdate()
    player:AddCollectible(COLLECTIBLE_BELT, 1, 0)
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
```
Aren't the mod tools fine but the Lua API shit?
Can someone tell me why this doesn't work?
arent the mod tools shit
afterbirth+ direction https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1cGDfaWgAEw6M3.jpg:large
https://zatherz.eu/abplus/class_grid_entity.html
they could be entities that can only be damaged with explosions
Won't tinted rocks be a part of the entity grid or whatever it's called?
no health
are tinted rocks entities?
that's ***FAIR***
that's a tinted rock

IE "This tear collided with a tinted rock", etc.
Trying again; do projectiles have any sort of premade variable which tracks the entity they collide with?
haha xd
<@266032468853915650> You're my hero ?
Check your log.txt
I didnt do anything and it stopped working
wait wut
<@!95444500364660736> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m2gk6/moms_knife_guppy_mod/
So one could argue that either one is the proper one :P
i'll kill them!
And apparently `judgement` used to be more popular
who payed you
sellout
Found via google https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=judgment%2Cjudgement&year_start=1400&year_end=2000&corpus=18&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cjudgment%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cjudgement%3B%2Cc0
Actually, it looks like both judgement and judgment date back **ages**
but the docs  dont have descriptions
i think that callback returns something
?
Is there an easy way to find out how much damage you will take in `MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG` callback?
Joudgement
I mean judgment
Poutin
Foud
Colour Armour
Yeah, it is
ment
judg
That's actually American vs British from what I can tell
ment
judge
Kinda like Aluminum and Aluminium?
maybe he has an accent, don't be rude
fun fact: judgment is the corret way to spell it but judgement is accepted
That's *precedent*
Item: "Reckoning"
Description: "Divine judgement befalls on you!"
Effects: Gives you 2 medium tier or 1 good tier devil/angel item depending on your precident.
yeah especially for the nature of the item
Effects like that really enchance the quality of a mod, I feel
<@266032468853915650> Niiice, looks very nice
yup
I just have the log open in sublime, but if I want to test something in real-time, I just use on-screen :P
https://s3.amazonaws.com/img0.recordit.co/fjBzKSKIWk.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAINSRFOQXTN4DT46A&Expires=1483656314&Signature=rEC4gRAtq4k%2FRqwe1RXkICrnhOA%3D
eyy it works
that i don't know ?
i just have a terminal that reloads the log
Nommiin claimed you can print to it
in-game console
I'm talking about the \` console
That's nice for a lot of detailed info, but if you want to inspect a certain value tree, rerunning the mod without playing many times in a row, it's inconvenient to have a separate window
oh yeah what were you talking about ?
<@229593818691928067> But... DebugString only outputs it to the log, doesn't it?
and now i am trying to figure out what the slow value does
It is not known
unknown?
unknown
or do ppl just not know how?
so u cant add items in pools?
Are item pools broken?
achoo http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835444194
what mods add items that are in pools
but arent in pools
GreenIsaac
its just a challange
there are a few that add items
jk
what is it
my mod lol
+
<@126590786945941504> Isaac.DebugString()
what good mods are there for afterbirth_
hey
yey
woo its working
and I already fixed the description typo
got my hands on a custom terminal
https://images.discordapp.net/.eJwFwdENhCAMANBdGIBKodVzG4IEzSklUHMfF3f3vb-5-2lWs6u2sQJsx0jSNztUeizZFpFy5tiOYZNcEFVj2q9cdQBOtFCYF6SA3hHhBMjMRC7M3n08O_IMd_1W-VXbajHPCwZ3Itc.gryGcjS4lBJ87rKQAtnJaNEE-tw
How do you do that?
Oh?
you can
You can't print to the console, can you?
ooh, that's actually very nice. Didn't think about that
erm
neat but i think using the console is easier
Example of what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/jBV06HQ.png
Also in case anybody's interested and can't be arsed to write the code themselves, load this mod https://hastebin.com/tafoguviva.lua and use the `log` function from your mod to print stuff on-screen
still, it's a start
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m34l3/making_an_active_item_play_a_sound/dc1q699/?context=3
looks like someone got a sound to play, but only while taking damage while there's at least 1 enemy in the room
on the console runs main.lua
luamod <modname>
do you have to restart the game very time you change your code
hahah
Game():Darken(-1, 20) lights it up instead of dakening
holy shit
You're risking getting hit and can hit the enemy mid-flip
Nah, that's kinda the point
Unless the current version does that
nice
Maybe freeze all entites when you're flipping too?
seems super disorienting though (which makes it fun)
thats awesome
oh god
oh ok that makes more sense
BTW, I've made a mod \o/ https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2738/magic-mirror#cid75303
ok so  print(Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoomIndex()) is the place the room is on the level grid
but yeah im pretty sure there is only 1 start room per floor type
AH ok thats how you call it
print(Game():GetLevel():GetCurrentRoomIndex())
is that for GetCurrentRoomIndex
even in different runs

the starting room seems to always return 84
through trial and error
fans will make documentation eventually
oh well
no tyrone will just gvie a few more shit broken mod examples and that'll be it
Anyone? https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_level.html#a2b06a28616ea09ea07f104ef32f9cc8f
Yeah, and including the rest of the API
i think thats what he means
how about with actual documentation
there's a mod on steam workshop that changes some of the recolor sprites into unique, cool sprites.
Anyone know how to use GetCurrentRoomIndex() from the Level class?
thank yo
I'm new to installing mods and the help page isn't thorough or specific enough. Someone give me a proper step-by-step pls

0h, in frames
Game():Darken(intensity (0.0 - 1.0), timeout in frames)
http://pastebin.com/QZxJKSxP
1 sec lemme show u my code
something is wrong with that, cant figure out what
At least without editing the game files directly
http://pastebin.com/wahsCEzQ
<@229593818691928067> Eh, I haven't been able to make it work, no
1-0 prolly the alpha
timeout is how long it stays dark
That bandage guy that shoots homing brimstone
<@124088844181045249> adding your items to content/itempools.xml doesn't work ?
Darken (float Darkness, integer Timeout)

oh
no
curse of darkness?
anyone know how Game():Darken() works?
cool !
Working on the art
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834783578 is what I'm doing mostly right now
>Item Exxpansion Mod v1.0 [WIP]

Item: "Demon Heart"
Description: "Bleed for me!"
Effects: HP+1 DMG+1.5 Angel-
Added: Only the HP works at this moment, sprite is done.

Item: "Heretic"
Description: "Angels Fall!"
Effects: DMG+1 Makes Mega Satan path viable with devil precident. Adds Angel statues to devil deal rooms.
Added: In the game, no effect.

Item: "Fortune Cookie"
Description: "Draw your fortune!"
Effects: All stats change. you have a higher chance for the stats to go up and if it goes down, it's not by much
Added: In the game, no effect.

Item: "Reckoning"
Description: "Divine judgement befalls on you!"
Effects: Gives you 2 medium tear or 1 good tier devil/angel item depending on your precident.
Added: In the game, no effect.
this
what are yall working on?
Will probably have to be fairly rare
Kinda surprise an item as simple as that hasn't been made yet, probably would be too strong
oh nice idea
or, rather, 1 in 6 chance when an enemy dies
So, more like the opposite
<@266032468853915650> It's everytime an enemy dies
so whats the status on modtools? are they as expansive to allow us to add new gameplay features like in antibirth?
<@124088844181045249> is BloodBattery basically the habit?
cant even get a passive that slows enemies to work
welp, no point in doing the check right now anyway
0 didn't work, anyway
maybe it's -1 or something, idk
Yeah, I just did an else after I exhausted all the values
a passive
still trying to get this to work when the player isn't moving
At least from my experience
the rest shifted up
as value 4
Left is actually at the end
Also, I found out that the Direction Enum is wrong
<@213504838103859200> in the EntityPlayer class
Also I spent like no time at the art
Shut up okay? I'm not good at art ?
Out of the items or however else
I haven't found any way to edit them
I meant the tears I shoot out
jesus christ are those even sprites?
okay, so what is the syntax for getting the player's current direction
oh i thought you meant have your items' damage scale with tear damage
Yeah, but that just gets the damage, I can't actually change it
<@124088844181045249>
Since I have no way to scale damage and range of the tears the items are probably waay too strong
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834783578

Updated my mini-expansion, any feedback? The sprites are god-awful, and the items are probably OP. But wondering if you find them interesting enough?
just check if this changes
no with update
Game::GetRoom ()
as far as I can see
there's no modcallback for it
uhm I'm searching
how do you do that?
I just would check if the player leaves the room
but I have no idea how to make it work
there's a class in the documentation for it
as in an effect that only lasts for the room, or a certain amount of time
what do you mean by temporary effect
I'm confused on the documentation for it
Has anyone gotten a temporary effect to work yet?
FeelsBadMan Did noone else try to create cards?
removes some bullshit
player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_SPEED_UP, PillColor.PILL_NULL )
or poison tears
welp, once again. i get the item but no stat increases
works
player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_SPEED_UP, PillColor.PILL_YELLOW_ORANGE )
i cant even being to imagine what nonsense at nicalis caused that
We can already Get, why not the other way around
We need Set functions
stats not increasing
welp
would that still make the character colored and also show the dumb SPEED UP shit
just not for dmg i guess
maybe but that still sucks
couldnt we just do player:UsePill(PILLEFFECT_SPEED_UP) to add stat ups?
modname.TearsofGrace
so the code would be this?
```local passiveId = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Tears Of Grace")

function modname:TearsofGrace()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(passiveId) then
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
  player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)
  end
end

modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, modname:TearsofGrace )```
the player will get the pill effects every frame
problem is
replace passiveId at the bottom with modname:TearsofGrace
addcallback takes a function
so... this?
```local passiveId = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Tears Of Grace")

function modname:TearsofGrace()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(passiveId) then
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
  player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)
  end
end

modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, passiveId )``` or replace the last one at the bottom as well?
you use passiveId for the HasCollectible function
then
<@180682585360302081> you put the name you used in items.xml in GetItemIdByName
?
multiple
does anyone how to make tarot cards?
fixed ?
```
if Game():GetFrameCount() % 60 == 0 then
        player:FireBrimstone(RandomVector())
      end
```
of the passiveId's should i change from the ones i have?
if Game():GetFrameCount() % 60 == 0 then
        player:FireBrimstone(RandomVector())
      end
what's wrong with this?
good luck with your modding
so which o t
yes
you then use that
that is Tears Of Grace
Night <@!142309138645516288>
it will then store that item's id in whatever variable you want to store it in
bye guys, love u
i'll post my logs here tomorow
Ok i'm going to sleep
you need to pass the name from the items.xml to GetItemIdByName
i am honestly confused
yay first mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835444194
then GetItemIdByName isnt gonna work
i dont even get why you're passing the id for a callback
the item in game is named Tears Of Grace but i think i forgot to change somethign in there
passiveId  is your item id
your item is named "passiveId"?
wait
oh
i assume its passiveId?
0 it is
yes
<@!173420370773147649> so that should be the item's id or?
^^
the ids are sorted by name? or what
k
oh
<@120355885615808512> I meant to say that to <@!142309138645516288>  ?
do ```HasCollectible(in whatever variable you store your item's id)```
oh okay
Newest entries will be last
Look at the bottom
the ids are sorted by name? or what
it's freaking hge
do you even call RegisterMod?
isnt gonna work
got my log file
also, ```HasCollectible(Tears Of Grace)```
<@180682585360302081> try removing spaces from the function name
ok thanks i'll check
log
so the item spawns in with this code but no effects, what to change?
```local passiveId = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("passiveId")

function modname:Tears of Grace()
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if player:HasCollectible(Tears Of Grace) then
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
  player:UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
  player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)
  end
end

modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, passiveId )```
of the log file ?
what's the name
on windows at least
It's located in documents\my games\binding of isaac afterbirth+
but it won't wor
the item can be taken
okay i'll check the logs
for afterbirth+
I recommend you to have the log up at all time
the effects do not apply but i have the item which is a step forward
probably wont
I mean, that would throw up an error in the logs
i'm not sure it'll make it work tho
thanks
ok
oh
jesus
, is a comma
what's a comma ?
<@124088844181045249> no it just don't work
you absolutely do not need a comma before then
`if(ToPickup(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART)), then`
but no effects
so i got the item
okay
Any error in the log?
any idea ?
```local    passive = RegisterMod( "passive", 1);
local item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Both");

function passive:item_effect( currentPlayer )
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  
  if player:HasCollectible(item)==true then
    pos = Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y);
    vel = Vector(0, 0)
    if(ToPickup(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART)), then 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubtype.HEART_BLACK, pos, vel, player);
    end
  end
  
end

passive:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE  , passive.item_effect, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER );
```
and i can't make it works
also i'm trying to make something that adds a black heart when you pickup a red one
okok
you could just say player instead
that is the code i got from someone to apply luck up range down and Scorpio
just do player:UsePill
ye
heheh
don't in case it doesn't work
you assign it to player, why are you repeating it
i really dont think so
my bad
maybe not
ho wait
also why bother assigning Isaac.GetPlayer(0) to player if you just repeat it
ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
we can do stuffs with spaces i think
i am new to this
i dunno
yep
ummm you sure about the function having spaces in its name?
modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, passiveId )
anything to change about this
```local passiveId = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("passiveId")

function modname:Tears of Grace()

modname:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, Tears Of Grace )```
rather than its only feature
good luck with adding states up
yeah, the angel statue thing seems like a small side effect of an item
to make it decent at least
might add dmg up
9 Volts doesn't stack :frowning:
and then you should find it in the spawn console

only useful if you need unlocks or have the d6
the second one seems completely worthless from a gameplay standpoint tbh
but put your item's name
because it's the name of my item
it's both here
put ```local item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("your item names here");
```
just kiddin
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM

no id=
do you guys think the item effects are ok? http://pastebin.com/ZUMdjVAP
there is no id tag
i did
Don't put `id=""` just dont put `id` at all in the xml file
that doesnt work when you want to add an item to an item pool
or something like that
Just use the usenameasid thing
thats weird
no idea how it works with multiple mods at the same time
it said c0 though
it automatically allocates 511, 512 and so on
now for the item script to work
so it gave id zero
<@180682585360302081> remove id tag
oops
@brosten
But if you want to give specific characters custom items, you gotta hardcode that: check which character you are playing as when you start, and give it the item
The things that work are quite neat
Let's cool down with the criticism till a week has gone and they have fixed shit they needed to fix. Even though it should have worked in the beginning.
My items work without the ID flags.
so leave id blank or remove the id tag entirely?
okok
the game will automatically generate ids
just dont use a custom id
so is there any fix for it?
thats because it doesnt work
or at all
well yeah
when i tried adding the id manually and **then giving a char the item **
it just doesn't appear in the console
bad api
it doesn't crash for me
because bad dlc
because afterbirth+
when i tried adding the id manually and then giving a char the item with the custom id it crashed
but why
^
i dont think id works
so i have this in items.xml
```<passive description="What could go wrong?" gfx="Collectibles_1337_TearsOfGrace.png" id="1337" name="Tears Of Grace" />```
the terminal works like a charm
ehh...
maybe he has a hardcoded limit of 2 heart containers
But there even is `boolean IgnoreKeeper` in the function...
Who Knows
then again, that's not lua so like
greed's gullet works with keeper though
but the console never displats is
implying keeper isnt hardcoded to shit
Shouldn't `Player:AddMaxHearts(2, true)` give Keeper another heart?
They could have simply forgotten to add the state setters. It would not be the first time
trying to get an item named tears of grace
still doesn't appear in game
nvm
oh wait
passiveId isntead of tears of grace
also
<@180682585360302081>  missing ) at the end?
?
I'm just hoping that it's part of some poorly-named function that no one's used properly yet, but I doubt it ?
true
http://pastebin.com/5WT9XkWz
could anyone help me with this?
you were a mistake
anime was a mistake
<@66197463593136128> "Belive it!" - Naruto
back to the Antibirth API I go
That should've been one of the earliest hooks they added
I'll accept it by not using this api
Yeah, something as basic as a fucking tears up should not need a workaround
accept it
I refuse to believe that
workarounds shouldn't be necessary for such a basic feature
<@71242588694249472> there are some workarounds using pill effects
I honestly am refusing to believe that's the case, that's too retarded
some api huh
correct
Does anyone know how to add stats to an item? Is there really no way to do that?
fuck you and your theories
Then you pick it up once, demonheart is set to true, and you pick it up again
Yeah but what happens if you diplopia demonheart then
and i want to execute the code once
?
is there a way to save information within a suspended run?
yea
the boolean is redundant
Sorry, I'm a slow little bean
but you're modding for it?
because the callback runs every tick
yeah that's what I told him flo
i dont play isaac man ?
good catch pm
<@266032468853915650> Why is it necessary to create your own variable for if you have demonheart or not? Why can't you just go "if  player.HasCollectible(player, demonHeart_item) then"
gotta be blue womb
count man :0
basement 1, 2, and then caves 1 2 then dank depths 1 2 then womb 1 **2**
blue womb maybe
what's 4_3?
thanks jerbear and pm2k
that's mom's heart you dip
4.2 is womb 2
god I hate this API
probably 4_2
stage4_2?
and isn't moms heart
becaus eit has GREED in the name
your shitty jokes are very helpful thanks
get it?
what
?
these ones might be mom's heart
32x32
How big the item can be?  (?x?)
which one would be mom's heart lol http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/cmy65u.png
http://www.last.fm/user/KyoZM
this api is making me go insane
so could there be any reason for the item not showing up in the console?
ah ok
no, i'm evil
Kyo lemme get that terminal
Is there any editing program that add shadow/light to the "item" image?
Well, at least compared to what I can do in a reasonable ammount of time
heres my code http://pastebin.com/ew8SbZze
mod debugging terminal ?
sick art
hol up
eyy
?
well shit because i need it only once
Like I said, hacky
<@162216634633814016>
unless I can set time delay to a function...
It would give you a new pill every frmaes
using `MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT` won't work :/
Ah, you'll have to do it in a very hacky way
so will it work if i replace passive effect here with this?
```Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)```
So it will just trigger once
care
that's every-frame-passive
<@162216634633814016> why do you need to remove it?
will do
No probelm, again, browse the workshop, get some mods and look what other did
<@77068961144909824> thanks
<@180682585360302081>  here is a template you can use to make passive items, but you need to add your own code, etc. https://hastebin.com/pucakapuku.lua
just look at the ab+ ones for example
I just said it was better than a lot of sprites
no
<@66197463593136128> did you just say something against my 10 minute edits of images from google
doubt it
Is there a way to remove callback after adding it?
no
does anybody have a preset for creating passive items?
thanks for the tips, gonna mess around with it for  a bit more xd
otherwise it's better than a lot of sprites
The bad news are that I had to use `Update` event because `Init` wouldn't work
looks good to me o.o
just needs less contrast between shades
did i fuck up the shading? xD
wow gay
But I want the tear to react to colliding with a purple fireplace regardless
<@66197463593136128> Nope, because purple fireplaces don't get damaged by tears
thanks nicalis
awesome
nop. gave up on that earlier
good morning, just woke up, any progress on making a sound play?
Is it possbile to remove breakfast and add my item as breakfast?
<@70946604139425792> can't you check if an enemy is damaged?
So, the good news are that I got the spawning to work
Is there a variable that tracks what entity a tear collides with?
IE: I want to see if a tear hits a fireplace
Ah, found it. Level():GetCurrentRoomIndex()
simple but cool
cause that's pretty cool
Is the guys who made the brimstump here ?
i forgot the workshop existed lol
thank u
godbless
someone did it
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834290227&searchtext=
yeah i assume so i just wanna khow how to do it lol
<@105465854551937024>  i'm pretty sure someone has already done it
5.100 if i remember correctly
What ID and subtype do I need to use to spawn item pedestal?
okay so, I've been asking to no avail as of yet if there's a way to call for entity spawn on tear impact with enemy as of yet, because I wanna make a trinket that adds a dice roll chance to spawn a tech laser that is directed towards another enemy
Do we have any idea how to add challanges yet?
as seemingly everything
maybe its just broken
still dont understand why AddCollectibleEffect doesnt work
i guess thats the closest i can get to an all stats up
mhh
damage up's missing tho
like you can get luck up or range up and stuff
that give the effect of a pill
well you had a pickup effect
whatcha mean
hey <@105465854551937024> can you provide help if you've dove into this?
yes use the pickup effect of the pills
since theres a table of collectibleEffects
nevermind lmao
oh?
im pretty sure its the item effect?
when you pickup the item you hold it above
oh
you can use the pills to simulate stats up can't you ?
what do you mean by pickup effect?
Like the pickup effect, pm2k?
<@266032468853915650> looks pretty nice
didnt seem to do anything
i tried to use AddCollectibleEffect to "simulate" stat ups
I'm just a mere programmer though
Not bad!
Anyone know what AddCollectibleEffect()` does?
how does this look?
for example
ENTITY_KNIFE instead of 8
spawns for me http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/t31ep5.png
???
why dont you use enums
Probably I'm doing something wrong then
```Isaac.Spawn(8, 100, 360, Game():GetRoom():GetCenterPos(), Vector(0,0), Player)```
Still doesn't spawn :/
Thanks!
It's a vector, so reference .X and .Y
<@162216634633814016> Game():GetRoom():GetCenterPos()
Then it doesn't spawn :/
0:0?
I don't blame you <@125999100754788353> , he can be funnier
What are the coordinates for center of the room?
awh thanks
<@227274809661194241> i like aleks more than you
obs is a sexy beast
<@134478547795443712> OBS is best for recording stuff, fraps take a lot of FPS so game will be laggy. But you'll have to change the settings for it
guys, what is the cue to get an effect to happen on tear impact? like say I want a trinket to have a dice roll chance to spawn a tech laser to the closest enemy. What would I tell it to call on if I want that to happen?
oh
?
Odd Mush adds shot height... oh god
bandicam
ShareX
cough
OBS
fraps
Hey guys, what's the best way to get a video of your screen?
Thanks!
haha i love that episode
<@162216634633814016> Isaac.Spawn(8, 100, {itemId}, pos, vel, player)
remade this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUrNBbKr-As
So...
thanks
with Isaac.Spawn
Does anybody know how to access this type "const Vector &" ??
yes <@162216634633814016>
like what would be the cue?
<@125999100754788353> you dont. kinda. its no quite working. you could try overriding bReakfast with the same ID (but different item)
One of my trinket ideas is to add an item that gives a chance to cause a tech laser to shoot out of a tear that connects with an enemy (ala 120 volt in antibirth) how would I go about programming that?
Is there any way to spawn an item pedestal?
<@109624258317033472> okay but how i can add the item to the itempool?
Still crashing :/
nop
Has tyrone not made the blog post yet?
That won't fix the problem, but I'll try
hey guys, I have a question
try an active item? ?
Nope, changing charge doesn't help
Nothing interesting
```[INFO] - Initialized player with Variant 0 and Subtype 13
[INFO] - Adding collectible 313 (Holy Mantle)
[INFO] - [warn] no animation named WalkDown
[INFO] - Caught exception, writing minidump...```
no idea
maybe try to set charge to 1
<@162216634633814016>  nothing in the log?
so it isnt in any item pool anymore
<@125999100754788353> i guess. you could change the ID in the items.xml
you cannot properly add custom items to itempools yet
no
Unless I'm missing it
Uhh, the room class doesn't seem to have a function to return it's ID...
```lua
local myMod = RegisterMod("TestMod", 1);
function myMod:EasyItems()
  local Player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  local game = Game();
  local diff = game.Difficulty;
  if(diff == Difficulty.DIFFICULTY_NORMAL) then
    local plt = Player:GetPlayerType()
    if(plt == PlayerType.PLAYER_THELOST) then
        Player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_CIRCLE_OF_PROTECTION , 0, false)
        Player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_HOLY_MANTLE , 0, false)
    elseif(plt == PlayerType.PLAYER_LILITH) then
        --Player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_INCUBUS, 0, false)
        Player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_HOLY_MANTLE , 0, false)
    end
  end
end
myMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT , myMod.EasyItems);```

Is it possible to remove breakfast item?
Why does RoboBaby randomly reacts with emotes?
Yo guys
doesn't count
it is on steam
guys what is this: "const Vector & SpriteOffset" some kind of pointer ?
yea shame!
send the  whole code
<@134478547795443712> im really disappointed your profile pic isnt an actual Plumbus from Rick and Morty ?
Yup, I used the same code earlier and it worked
we found a plumbus PogChamp
we found ur mom
<@120355885615808512> Crashes as well
I've been asleep for 7 hours. Did we find anything new? Item pools?
<@162216634633814016> you sure you defined Player ? not player ?
weird, tried a different item?
<@120355885615808512> Yeah, after disabling it everything works fine
The Animation editor works very well on Linux using Wine
Got it, thank you.
just type 1
API version
What's the second parameter to RegisterMod do
are you sure you are giving the correct parameters
you sure this line is what makes the game crash?
yeah its quite easy to get thegame to crash wih Lua
It doesn't even give an error, it just crashes
```Player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_INCUBUS, 0, false)```
with the addcollectible
send me the line
No, I used it in `MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT` event
<@162216634633814016> you typed Player:AddCollectible in the console?
ok
i'll tell you if i get any goo results
i'm going to try to wrap it now
i just were bad at using it
<@152838359331504128> ok it works pretty well
Using `Player:AddCollectible` crashes, but using `giveitem` in console works just fine o.O
good luck
ok
it's ok
I was going to resort to that anyways
nah but it can send it to you if you want
i thought maybe you found a download
ok
trying to fix them now
but i'm having a lot of problem with it
then i wined them
i wined steam so i could download afterbirth + the pc version
<@152838359331504128> that's a bit of a long story
Anyone have an idea for workaround?
giving lilith another incubus crashes game :frowning:
guys! it's so easy to remove your unlocks and achievements in afterbirth+!
- Removes Achievements
?
Guys, if i want to add a custom familiar, after AddCollectible(collectibleType._____, etc) in that blank space how can i add my own entity
just changed the coin in the hud to a rupee as well
<@!142309138645516288> you were talking about using the tools on wine, can you tell me where you got them?
yes, which equals fun for you until you figure out what ID is crashing it and you exclude that one
lol
still possible it consideres an unfinished but reserved id which will crash your game valid though lol
never
good if it actually works
there you go
they just have to finish them. not that big of a deal figuring out
surprised
`
static boolean Config::Config::IsValidCollectible    (    CollectibleType     ID    )    
`
wouldn't be surprised
is there no function to check if an item ID is valid anyway
I can't wait until all the mod tools are fully dug through and figured out
I meant a random number of times as high as the number anyway
yeah prob
?
the 0 is better
how do I get a table of the valid ids
just ipairs iterate through the valid ids an amount of times equal to the number of items
const ItemList& Config::Config::GetCollectibles    (        )     ?
no idea
always the fool
not for cards though it seems
same for trinkets
yes
ye
for spawning
no 0
or 1
putting the subtype to 0 makes it choose a random item
?
rip
nevermind
I'm a retard
I'm not
no
oh wait
are you trying to make an item that adds different items to isaac or something?
is there a way to access the item pools?
not sure
^
item id 43 is missing
and also wouldnt include modded items.
Isaac.TrySpawn Kappa
wait
there's some missing
which
lol
some numbers aren't items I mean
RandomInt() !!
some ids aren't items
but
but
true
math.random xD
that's easy
has anyone found a way to get a random item id
most*
because for the modt part, the most reliable way to dodge tears is to dodge the shadow instead
but for real, the main thing that the engine calculates that is in a pseudo 3D range is tear height, but that's done using a simple art trick with shadows, and just applying a hitbox to that instead of the tear flying
xD
what would that be?
maybe, or it could be revolutionary and do 2.7D
sure not 2.6D? ?
it's 2.5D
I'll probably have to make a custom item then, because one of the ideas I have is to make a shitty little platformer
is the game 3d? juts thought about tearhight? or is that the only thing what's 3d
enough to do some really minor platforming tho
<@227274809661194241> it's not like an actual jump if you meant to ask that. It' more like a dash in a direction that can't defy gravity for too long
nice fix Kappa
Kappa
oh because it's old
<@122924009527574530> wanted to test your mod... no idea how to play your mod xD
more or less
does how to jump work well in 2D areas?
im off for dinner, later
no worries ?
xD sounds so cool. shame i havent tried the mod yet. will do later on ?
everything dark and then BAM light, shit and they all chase you
it's such a great change
a friend suggested turning the lights on when enemies find you
haha
nvmtheres a changlog

oh okay
like, the mod uploader runs trough wine so why not the animation editor ?
i really don't understand why they havent hadded it to the official mac game
OMG GUYS
not me
transit did
wha
<@162156525337575425> didn't you make a pickup?
Well the animation editor works perfectly fine on wine

EDWARD RETWEETED MY RUPEES
2 clicks in SAM
so their things still let us cheat
HOLY SHIT
someone will get an achievement easier? boo hoo its not like you can 100% it with like
and i got the achievements
i could have done worst
whats the point
that was not hard
why should they
to get some things i've done in the ps4 back
all scipt mods should, all other not  imo.
i just cheated all the way in rebirth
no mods should disable achievements, its just flat out nonsense
should sound mods disable achievements? i don't see how it's considered cheating
can download steam achievement manager and alt+f2
anyone who wants to cheat
manualy
none of them should
they are looking into fixing cosmetics mod disabling chievos
true scaze but it could then be an option to disable achievement
thats true
yeah well ok, graphic mods should definetly not disable achievemtns
?
FUCKING GENIUS NICALIS
OP eden start players.xml mod? yeah ok go ahead
want a colored missinghud? lol achievements gone
oops my archivement gone
i have changed the health bar of bosses
Disabling achievements is still reasonable. i for one do not want to get some achievements just because i tried out some mods.
And it's a single player game... so it's on you if you get the achievements the right way
it sure does suck that having a simple balls of steel sound mod disables achievements though ?
what a waste of fucking time
guys
ikr
hmm
wow that was hard
just install the cheats the old way
it's not like we are not able to cheat anymore
i agree portal
<@243109059555753984> Yes. This here is definitely not something for learning how to program
so people know how to use this shit
and spend time idk actually documenting the api
they should flat out remove the disabling achievements shit instead of bothering with this
not hard to find a way
i can't say i'm a programmer either, i'm just a fan of the game that wants to make mods for the game i like, but i guess i should learn some real programming stuff before i do that haha
its really not exciting
<@162156525337575425> well they said they are looking into a possibility to enable cosmetic mods without disabling achievements
stripped it down to the minimum
<@122924009527574530> the link you send my is good and ive done it this way already, but it still does not work ? it always dumps the same error message:
...89: attempt to index a nil value (global 'io')
thanks scayze
<@198846198122151937> <@!142309138645516288>
in which case do them the old way so that they dont disable achievements
Not modding anything before does not mean he is not experienced in programming
and even then the api is p succ
unless you want to make reskins/music mods
you need to know lua
<@243109059555753984> Did you program before?
yah stay away from this
i'll take that as a no
>not even experienced people can work with this shit
>never modded anything
are the modding tools easy to work with at all? i've never modded anything before but i'd really like to give it a try
i'm back
ok my dudes
you actually maaged to add something wich is nice
i'd like to see it too
<@198846198122151937> what for? i sent you everything. But ok. wait a sec
yeah but that would require them to release the specification publicly or us to crack the files, which we did for the most part and that resulted in basement renovator
so can you send me your whole mod <@109624258317033472> ?
for me the upload mod tool don't even work
that would be nice
cross-platform tools possibly. using some presentation layer thats cross-platform. (SDL,GTK,...)
IIRC someone tried their hand at a .anm2 editor a while ago
nice name <@229593818691928067>
<@133659541198864384> you mean, mac tools ?
<@109624258317033472> you made a new entity and animation but where do you put its AI ?
<@!142309138645516288> or they would give us the file format specification and we could make our own set of good tools
?
wrong wolf
<@174193097285173250>  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/lua_file_io.htm
i might even wine rap them and upload the mac version online
starfall it's questionable if there even is a way
<@122924009527574530> i get an error message when i try that :(
```

Oh yeah
my anm2
and apply stuff in the lua code
why wouldnt you? you can make own anm2 in the editor
I managed to make an anm2
syntax sugar
so we can't make new paterns yet ?
its brother bobby
io:open("file") is the same as io.open(io, "file")
oh
and an the anm2 is just copied from the main entities2 file
yah send us the whole mod
i don't see how you did all this
cause you managed to make a anm2
[your mod fodler]/content
actually could you send me the all mod so i can look at it
and where do i put that to add it to my game ?
is there any other code at all?
ho
<@!142309138645516288>  ```    <entity anm2path="669.699_custom_fam.anm2" baseHP="5" boss="1" champion="0" collisionDamage="5" collisionMass="3" collisionRadius="13" friction="1" id="6660" name="Bro" numGridCollisionPoints="12" shadowSize="11" stageHP="10" variant="1">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="10" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />
    </entity>``` the xml
why : and not . <@122924009527574530>  ?
<@109624258317033472> can i see the code of the floating thing ?
io:open("filename", "w")
IO? for reading files? they are there, lowercase io
i just have a ... thing floating around
i havent found a waz to make it attackable
please find  way !
anyone knows how to load the "IO" commands into a mod ?
we trying to
have you found a way to make ennemies ?
what is it ?
oh
it's not an item
tyrone wrote about posting something to help with modding at some point iirc. did he do that yet?
then you can find you item in the spawn list by tapping the name you put
but you gotta place the anm2 file accordingly in your mod folder structure
You add that at the begining of your code
<@198846198122151937> change the anm2 root to just  "gfx/" so it can corectly merge with the main entities xml
<@198846198122151937> just use ```local item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("YOUR ITEM NAME HERE");````
thank*
than you
interesting
hmmm
oh
hmm
http://i.imgur.com/gaAFGaa.png
id=3 are familiars
<@132627275307810817> to spawn a familiar you can either use 
player:AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SACRIFICIAL_DAGGER, 0, false)
or
Isaac.Spawn(3, 35, 0, pos, vel, player)
here I'll show you my code
can somebody help me with making a passive out of this?
```Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)```
xD
hm.
mine is at 6660, all other entities are beloe 1000
yes
have you gave it a custom id?
Now it worked
Oh nevermind
mine just doesn't spawn, like it doesn't come up on the spawn list
<@198846198122151937> what doesnt work at yours?
I tried everything
How the fuck do you make an item with 0 charges?
<@198846198122151937> i got an working Entity who moves across the screen
And another thing
Since you can't really use any other info since it could change depending on where it is in the room/hp/velocity/what other enemies exist/etc.
ayy it is better
Isaac + Afterbirth = ?????
i made a better title screen mod
nope
I think the debug mod should only have things that are unique to an entity, so stuff like its ID, Mass, etc.
<@198846198122151937> it doesnt work?
http://i.imgur.com/v0Qw7hE.png
That makes sense.
who pushs the other one
for collision
Why do entities have a Mass attribute?
i got all the code for my new entity, but this api is so stupid, it doesn't want it to spawn
Neither in the entityplayer
i cant find that in the entityfamiliar
do you know how to spawn a familiar
ye, it's pretty useless
Hey
What I'm saying is that velocity isn't useful to know about in-game
that's weird
you can basically use the velocity to plug idle effects into items, but I can't figure out how to code that into an item off the top of my head
now that you say might not work
hum
that works afterbirth+?
Just use rick's unpacker
my update.it file keeps comming back
godamit
Can anyone help me fix my resource extractor? its not working it wont extract because of afterbirth a? heres an image http://prntscr.com/drvyy5
No, it's 0, 0
because isn't velocity -1 when you're immobile?
How do you use ItemConfig ?
Velocity can be used to get idle effects in
which is what i'm making this mod for, since i doubt you'd use it for playing
it's up
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835305256
although now that i think about it, velocity, position, and hp aren't exactly useful for making mods
once we learn how to do more shit, can you hook me up with guides? I want to get into modding, but right now people have yet to really dig through the mod tools to find out how to fully use them
ok thanks
I've got my debug mod saying the position, velocity, type, and hp of the entity. Is there anything else that could be useful?
```<entities anm2root="gfx/" version="5">
    <entity anm2path="360.000_Bro.anm2" baseHP="0" boss="0" champion="0" collisionDamage="0" collisionMass="3" collisionRadius="13" friction="1" id="6660" name="Bro" numGridCollisionPoints="12" shadowSize="11" stageHP="0" variant="1">
        <gibs amount="0" blood="0" bone="0" eye="0" gut="0" large="0" />
    </entity>
</entities>
```
well can I see the xml?
<@198846198122151937> its barely any code, its mostly creating xml files and copying and renaming the anm2 files
and that shit has to be in a folder called lua in the rebirth folder
gotta do require "name" to load shit into the main.lua
ok can you send me the code you used for that?
do did ANYONE manage to have more than 2 custom cards?
sheeeesh
without crash
also no nova it is very complicated currently
<@198846198122151937>  HOLY SHIT. i spawned a SHADOW
yea but it sucks
has anyone figued out how to load extra files ? like .txt or .lua into the main.lua file ?
woah it's the real nova!
I'm done with this  holy shit. you have to use a custom card as entity in AddCallback(..MC_USE_CARD,..) but it triggers ALL CARDS and player:GetCard(0) always returns 0 ? becaue the card is already used ?? wtf
are there any good guides on how to use the mod tools?
entities2.xml has most of the information of it
yah I'm just having trouble with the xml, cause I don't know how you define a custom entity
i spawned a crash and a minidump
did you manage to get something you could spawn?
i was trying but no. might get back at it later on
so back to the matter at hand has anyone succesfully created a custom entity with custom sprites and animation?
cool. im still getting to know lua, thanks man
And withouht the `local`specifier
Yes, just declare them outside of any scope.
no wait, is it possible to create global vars in lua that remain between function calls?
thanks
that might work
calling setCharge doesnt do anything probably because it looses the charge after the lua script
have a check before the item is used and if the condition is true use the effect but don't use the charge
returning false or true doesnt do anything
does anyone know how prevent an active item from loosing charge when used and a special condition meets
yah im trying to make a new enemy but I can't find anything on getting textures sorted out
wow
hey I found my bug.. MC_USE_CARD doesn*t only trigger when it's your entity specified.. but all your custom cards
can't figure it out yet tho
<@198846198122151937> been looking for that too
hey does anyone know how to add a custom npc?
good
^^
<@72413153614368768> nah, once it has more features and isnt buggy in large  rooms it is definetly useful. But th simple entity type is probably not
<@120355885615808512> works now ? mod was flaged as [OLD] -.-
I should probably make it do contact damage while you are in the air but that's also something I haven't quite figured out yet
shouldn't be too hard though
and it's also buggy in large rooms
right now all it does is give the ID of the entity (Type.Variant.Subtype), and only entities that aren't of type 1000(effect entities)
btw, should i upload my debug mod to the workshop?
<@174193097285173250>
the if works for me
http://i.imgur.com/NFubFdh.gifv
I'm monstro
render text never worked for me ?
what item <@154701703474577408> ?
<@120355885615808512> doesnt seem to work ? 
```
local function onRender(t)

    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and entities[i].Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN then
            Isaac.RenderText("caoin", 50, 20, 255, 255, 230, 255)
        end
    end  
end
```
I figured out how to do invincibility, now this item is still going to be horrible to play with but not impossible :D
I rly want to get into the tears
TELL ME
WHY DOES IT TRIGGER
thanks <@72413153614368768> i try a round a bit
```lua
local H = false;
local LA = false;
local RA = false;
local LL = false;
local RL = false;

if H and LA and RA and LL and RL then
        Game():FinishChallenge()
end
```
not rly
The keys are ours bois
Those are item pedestals
<@174193097285173250> Search for entities of type 5 and variant 100
Is this
1st this I sre
Oh sbit
```LUA
 player:GetTearFlags():TearColor( 25,0,255 )```
tfw u overthink stuff
cause that would be dope
?
new tear efect ,
to creat
are you about to find a way
ugghhhhhhhh
wait a minute
so I need to create an instance of it some how and TemporaryEffects(), TemporaryEffects.new() TemporaryEffects.create() and others don't work
I have not been able to call TemporaryEffects, it says it's nil
BUT
What you can do is call TemporaryEffects's function GetCollectibleEffect which will give you a TemporaryEffect which has a member Config::Item
it disappears instantly if i don't have mom's knife
does anyone know how to control a EntityKnife ?
but I'm stuck again
ok I fucking found Config::Item
this is what I did for coins
```lua
 local coins = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #coins do
        if coins[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP and coins[i].Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN then```
that way you can really get it right
i need to make it so i can find subtype and variants as well, though
Id rather see crashes than [Old]
Wofsauge in the console it's spawn 5.100.id
<@174193097285173250> item pedestals are of type 5, so you could check through all entities in the room and only do stuff on the entities of type 5
make sure that you have 1 as the second value in your RegisterMod, and check the version number in the xml
Im rly getting sick because of thsi [Old] msg
halp
pls
wow lua so good cannot output a freakin boolean
~~be on a laptop without a charger, sjoecool~~
I wonder how to slow the entire game rather than just the enemies
huh
gimme a sec, i think i can do this
does anyone know how to get collectible / pedestals in the current room ? (Lua)
np
Works, thanks thefinaluptake
if anyone has ideas to make it more accurate that would be appreciated
okay it didnt work, but I excepted that lol
without being able to get exact camera coords you can't really make it super accurate
I've had problems outputting bools as well
woah what, my mods folder is missing
i got it kinda working - https://streamable.com/pvbvu
H.tostring() doesn't work
how do I output a boolean ?
at least, try that
use game.Difficulty
; is unnecessary anyway, but let me check
Ymm...
<@109624258317033472> using `local diff = game:Difficulty;` gives `function arguments expected near ';'` error on the same line
but its like 5% that its it
I might have figured adding stats
lets see
oh cool, thanks to a person on the subreddit I now know how to apply the slows too
Why would you need to disable the console? just don't open it if you aren't using it
oops, forgot to install Notepad++ on this PC
Anyone know how to disable debug console on mods?
ahh
frames of invincibility
iFrames?
what I need to figure out is how to give Isaac iFrames, I know it's possible because I saw someone else had done it but I don't know how
so this is hard
The programming knowledge I have comes from  semester of computer science courses....in Java
well the item I've been making has it the other way round (as in, only do this when the player is trying to move) so your idea sounds doable
hehe
this is going to be the case of "I know how to make the pseudocode, but I don't know the syntax"
ah, so check if its -1, got it
it's -1 if you aren't moving and 0/1/2/3 for left, up, right, down
I think i'll upload it soon to the workshop
direction is an enum that returns what way you are trying to move
np
All the rupees appear to work
<@142309138645516288> yeah found them already, thanks though
use direction not velocity imo
but I have not touched Lua before
I have done a bit a programming in the past and I do know the basics of object orientated programming
```if H and LA and RA and LL and RL then
        Game():FinishChallenge()
    end```
what is wrong with this. it does that even when all are false
good luck tho!
maaan, i gotta play Gungeon. but i forgot to buy it when it was on sale ?
not sure it is possible to slow things that much though
<@180682585360302081> Just tap spawn 5.2 and there would be the list
but yeah
or the superhot watch from Gungeon ?
cool! just like Superhot? ?
an*
I want and item that slows all enemies  like stopwatch, but only when you aren't moving
Ill try
maybe the velocity is not instant 0, but instead has really small values, i dont know, you gotta try
thats way easier than I thought
so basicly. if player.Velocity == Vector(0,0)
just check if its 0 then?
anybody has the id's for coin black coin and silver coin?
Entity has an public attirbute Velocity
how do I check if the player is idle
I wanted to ask if anyone knew. I would like to make a passive item that only works when your character is not moving, how would I go about doing that
tfw there is no donation machine at the first shop
Ah, I posted my question in the wrong place
thanks anyway
there would be some tutorials and stuff
i think i'll see in a few days
yeah but i wanna create a tottaly new npc
has anyone managed to create an familiar?
<@!142309138645516288> if you want to add an NPC, you probably need to use `Isaac.Spawn(<npc_id>, <npc_variant>, etc)`
nvm think i found it
how do i give myself a key with the console?
np!
ok, thanks once again!
<@162216634633814016>  you have to put the enum name in front like that:
``` if difficulty = Difficulty.DIFFICULTY_NORMAL```
a callback to add npcs
i'm looking for it
just replaced all coins that you insert in slot machines and beggars etc. with rupees
could there be something like"add npc" ?
so for pooping monstro we have ```NPCUpdate```
so, I got the difficulty, how do I check if it's specific difficulty? (` == DIFFICULTY_NORMAL` doesn't work)
had a few errors beeing thrown from that file when i set callbacks up badly
it isnt n sample, it automaticly gets called when you register an mod
seems to be the key to stat changes
or how to use them?
anyone know what cacheflags are?
look like it's a sample
i don't know actually
nah it's blank
```
function RegisterMod(modname, apiversion)
  local mod = {
    Name = modname,
    AddCallback = function(self, callbackId, fn, entityId)
      if entityId == nil then entityId = -1; end
      
      Isaac.AddCallback(self, callbackId, fn, entityId)
    end,
    SaveData = function(self, data)
      Isaac.SaveModData(self, data)
    end,
    LoadData = function(self)
      return Isaac.LoadModData(self)
    end,
    HasData = function(self)
      return Isaac.HasModData(self)
    end,
    RemoveData = function(self)
      Isaac.RemoveModData(self)
    end
  }
  Isaac.RegisterMod(mod, modname, apiversion)
  return mod
end```
``
it's the hud
it's not blank
ho wait
could be usefull
on the files
there is a blank lua sample
damn
Thanks!
has anyone figured how to had ennemies ?
So
so ```local game = Game()
local difficulty = game:Difficulty```
or something along the lines
<@162216634633814016> difficulty is an public attribute of game
xD oke
ignore my above comment
i hate this code
gah and now it doesn't work
lik for the bible that oneshots mom and mom's heart
<@122924009527574530> would that allow an item to oneshot one specific ennemy
Do you know how to get difficulty as variable?
<@122924009527574530> when does it return nil and when not?
hey
hi

local npc = entity.ToNPC()
if npc ~= nil then
  -- woot
end
its the first item from my small AB+ list
you just have to check for nil before using it
ok just found something we talked about before. ToNPC is a cast, not a clone
this thing will give you a chance to shoot a prism tear that will break into 7 tears
what does it do ?
thanks
that look cool <@146600389779783680>
maybe check if the tear is low to the ground?
I was a bit bored
I'm trying to figure out how to identify that a tear broke
Ah ok tank you ^^
hmm this looks interesting Gib
wich is stupide of me
instead of heart (soul)
i was looking for blue heart
ok i got this thanks a lot
```lua
function testmod:explosiveTears()
    local curEntList = Isaac:GetRoomEntities()
    for i,ent in ipairs(curEntList) do
        if ent.Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR  then
            Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_EFFECT, EffectVariant.BOMB_EXPLOSION,
                        0, ent.Position, Vector(0, 0), ent)

        end
    end
end
```
Is pretty much all there is to it
and np
here is an example
thanks
ok
OOOH
spawn 5.(number of the pickable here)
oh its spawn
I'd have to do some crazy stuff like detecting what room Isaac is in and using Isaac's coordinates to determine the text offset to get this to work
on the console
<@77068961144909824> ? how cool is that. How did you do that? is it on steam workshop yet?
i mean
with SpawnEntity I believe
can't find it on the site
there is
Darn.
anith there no way to spawn pickables ?
and kewls stats
I know I had that problem a ton when I implemented cameras in my projects
kewl tnt tears
Yeah
Oh crap, that's totally what it is, isn't it...
I might be wrong though
can't find them in the documentation
I don't think that you will be able to do that without having the camera coordinates
modding is ? https://streamable.com/5gmp0
To get information about entities
It's meant to be a debug mod
ok..?
That's the entity type
there are tons of red numbers
Ooh
I mean in the video
no
That's RBGA
At the end?
what do even the numbers mean :?
do you have the command line to spawn a blie heart ?
Isaac.RenderText(tostring(entities[i].Type), entities[i].Position.X / 1.55 + 20, entities[i].Position.Y / 1.55 - 100, 255, 0, 0, 255)
I already have one, this is my code for the render text
Looks like you need to apply a offset
it seemingly doesnt do anything
how is AddCollectibleEffect supposed to work
Works in small rooms, but not large ones :( https://streamable.com/1fn4z
that souds nice
Nice !
at least picking stuff up and descs works ?
gotta try that
xD
ok
who are you to say that i'm old, game ?
go to your mod folder and remove update.it
delete update.it
thats ez
oh
AND I CAN'T USE IT
it says [OLD]
when i wanna take the mod i just created
which is
got a problem !
backgroundish thanks guys :3
ok thanks
5.100
what's the id for pedestral ?
if you mean that. dunno
5.100.?
ok
spawn [id for pedestral].[itemid]
thx
to see if the collectible works
like a not yet gave brimstone
not on isaac
how can i spawn an item
console question:
```local game = Game()
local level = game:GetLevel()
```
how do I get level ?
no guarantee tho ^^
or Level::SetNextStage
?
Level::SetStage sounds like it could accomplish this
any other ideas?
<@125999100754788353> It might be a lttle early to mod if you're not patient
well.... ok?
imma quit modding even tho i havent modded anything
no
code
^-
and multiple piles
just spawn a shovel
code or console?
Can I somehow port to another floor? or even better spawn a teleporter chest
hah
it's "main.lua"
found it
neverminf
on the mod file i mean
where should i put it and with what name ?
stupid question but now that i've finished the lua codding of my item
Any update on the docs?
x3
<@156727053121617920> was almost done replacing coins with rupees
but to replace common cold with scorpio all i have to do is this
```Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_SCORPIO, 0, false)```
right?
I would enjoy a The legend of Zelda skin pack skin pack
I think I will stick to spriting atm
dunno
?
isn't it ```
ToPickup()```
but don't know how to set up the rest
yeah, but the only problem is that i have that part of the script
if this works
or you could check item pedestals?? and do the same. not sure though
you could check the items and just add scorpio and remoe common cold
because that has 100% what i want
more or less
yes
is it possible to replace the common cold with scorpio?
no
wait
wanna know
dunno
is there even a callback for item pickup?
imo, this is interesting
dunno how to set it up myself
could somebody give me a script that applies this on item pickup?
```Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_COMMON_COLD, 0, false)```
wtf I just wrote totaly bullshitt into the itempools.xml. no error anything
Lua doesn't use paranthesis for if statements, or at least it's not neccesary
hmm how would I add a new Tear Type...
so what sall i put in the () to make a (if the player pickup a blue heart ?)
but dunno how to use them
Woahhh ?
hmm
somebody also said this
for luck there is a player:DonateLuck(integer luck) function
``` test ```
``` if player:HasCollectible(item)==true then
    pos = Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y);
    vel = Vector(0, 0)
    if( I NEED SOMETHING HERE) then 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART , HeartSubtype.HEART_BLACK, pos, vel, player);
    end
  end```
cool
uhh i didnt even know that
```like this```
use three ` to begin and end the code
if player:HasCollectible(item)==true then
    pos = Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y);
    vel = Vector(0, 0)
    if( I NEED SOMETHING HERE) then 
        Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART , HeartSubtype.HEART_BLACK, pos, vel, player);
    end
  end
<@!142309138645516288> copy and paste xD
o
to show you
oh
```Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_RANGE_DOWN, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):UsePill(PillEffect.PILLEFFECT_LUCK_UP, 0)
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):AddCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_COMMON_COLD, 0, false)```
somebody gave me this but dunno how to use it
hmm
?
how do i put code on discord
player:FireTear(arguments)
Huh
It's a function under the player entity
Yeah, Shooting the different types of tears is working
but with the current documentation figuring it out will take at least 3 days
dont know
shooting tears should be easy, sholdnt it?
there are some workarounds
stats are a pain in the arse
good luck, nobody knows how to add stats yet
i still need to figure out how to get a passive item shoot (green) poison tears and gives you luck up and range down
I paused that venture for now
seems like you have to either define it perfectly or extract a costume from an item
my bane from yesterday
:/
Fluffles no
nop.
soo uhm anyone figured how to use costumes yet?
the vector and positiion are set too
Then i cant seek help here i think
no i use Paint.net
no
already set the function
ah
photo shop?
Photoshop
i know
what is PS?
Yo guys, anyone uses PS?
before the if
BOuh you have to do a bunch of stuff
ok
yes
so can i use the functions defined in Entity on that Entity &?
what sould i put here:
"if( ) then" 
if i wanna make something happens when the player pickup a blue heart
so changing that Entity variable will change the other variable stored somewhere else
Entity& is Entity, but referncing already existing memory somewhere else
ik its a pointer or smth like that
yep
BOuh, can one write everything in one sentence?
how can i turn a Entity & to a Entity
xD
<@122924009527574530> that sounds horrible, oh my god xD
when the player pickup a blue heart
something happens
no brace
if i wanna make
if( ) then
what sould i put here:
another tidbit, the doom multiplayer was lockstep everywhere, so if 1 player had a slow computer, everybody else ran the multiplayer slow
Suhh
i have a question
hey guys
hm. cool, interesting
everything else is interpolated
to keep lockstep sync
for example starcraft 2 runs at 60fps but the game engine is only at 10 or 15 fps IIRC
so that will definitey run faster than the other two
i mean, no not really? you'd probably want one for the game graphics and one for ui not both?
post render is tied to your framerate
but ok. thank you <@122924009527574530> that would make somewhat sense
what's this for? http://prntscr.com/drukof
<@135254843567767552>
thats what post_render is for? isnt it
so update is every game loop and perfect is all update calls
post peffect should be post processing for shaders and such tho
guessing this is one of those callbacks
if they are a frame behind etc
there is a thing about gameloops that sometimes they have to catch up
<@122924009527574530> i dont get it. there has to be a reason for this callback. what is this for?!?!  Hopefully tyrone will shine more light on that with his coming blogspost
where is the isaac character? (Found it)
Welp, time to learn scripting then
ok, thanks, weird
amazing
Ah shit, scripting?
<@109624258317033472>
ok did some debugging on update and perfect update, seems that update is the stable one and perfect update sometimes runs twice/three times between update runs
<@125999100754788353> i honstely dont know how the fog is animated, maybe you have to script it, maybe its in an anm2 file, which woud mean with the animator tool, yes
coins worth 5 are blue and coins worth 10 are red

it's just a simple texture replacement
<@109624258317033472> animate with ainimation tool in ab+?
congratz ?
welp my rupees work
<@125999100754788353> well, yes, but you would also have to properly animate them. dunno. You could try
I mean, the more debug information the better, right?
So, i can retexture fog to snow drops?
would that be useful to anyone?
i kinda want to make a debug mod that displays entity information above every entity
found out why my coins were not replaced
ah whoops
but that would be resource intensive
maybe even with particle effects
you could make an overlay, like the fog one in the womb
hmm, that seems possible
Is it possible, if so, how?
I want to make snow rain in binding of isaac
<@125999100754788353> what is it?
Anyone wanna help me?
<@109624258317033472> give me a few, I'll check
so wait, i tried swapping my coins but the textures remain the same after editing them
Anyone wanna help me?
Yo
and needed for some features of the API
its slower
that would make sense
could it be Post Physics Update?
if frames are skipped etc
I use it as the main update function, not the other one, too fast and erratic
it's a stable update function
hehe
i read that as post_perfect but that doesnt make sense ?
what the hell is POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE
yea but you don't have to set the ones of items
some the same (fun)
all entities have ids
oh god cards and pills have ids WutFace
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m713o/what_i_have_learned_from_coding_ab_after_2_days/
but i dont trurst this API anymore, so who knows
i mean, they definetly should. Havent done that yet tho
or cards
if I added pills
? what do you mean
do pick ups spawn?
It may be alphabetical or it may be in the order that the xml is
I'm not sure about how it's created within a single mod
I think it may be alphabetical order in which it assigns them? For in-between mods, that is
welp everything i'm doing now is crashing me so i guess that's as far as i know how to take it
as in what order
all comes down to how the game automatically assigsn the ids
well you need to try to know
we would need a library mod whatever. with specific methods for hey i want my item in this pool and this mod would make the itempools.xml
which will break other mods if you add your items to itempools though
Id rather have the game determine the ID for me
yeah, I would not touch IDs if I were you
the other mods would need to do that too..
Yeah, that was the way I was thinking it could work. Since in your lua code you can find what the ID of your items are
mmm
how about lua code generating your itempools.xml?
hm ok wouldn't be very efficent anyways
manually entering an id doesnt work
is there a way to set it manually?
can you set the ids at your own?
wait right
<@173420370773147649> did you try using very large ids?
<@109624258317033472> the problem are the IDs
I geuss we'll have to wait for the blog post and update. Thanks anyway
i haven't been able to get an item spawning naturally in game using the xml files, but i've only tested a trinket
I see, I meant specifically without editing the game files directly
doesnt it merge xml files you have in your mod directory with the in the source dir?
I´m triying to add some items to the item pools too, lets see if I can.
afaia theres no other way
that however will break compability between mods
you just add the item id to the itempools.xml
So has anyone managed to get adding items to the item pools working?
i need to use a dll
afaik, dofile only executes lua files
well running those functions just crashes the game. sorrow
thought you said you tried that
that's what I'm pointing you to
in the first comment
but what about the workaround
lol
fun
300 lines almost now
damn
:S
I have 1 huge file
shrug then
yeah i have seen that
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m4nxm/psa_luas_require_is_fucked/
(lol)
so where should i put it in?
pipe yea that's what I'm saying
but its there
there is a thread high on the reddit
I guess that was ironic? :D
and it says that it cant find the dll in any folder
i have tried using the require function
pipe yea but you have to solve the include file issues first, since the mod folder isn't the one being used when your mod loads
everything you can do in the config items is just stuff you can add to the xml
XBagon you fucking genius
is there any way to use lua libraries?
The Config Item stuff is (I'm pretty sure) the stuff in items.xml
it's a layer ontop of selected functionality
no
the short of it is that surely they didn't actually use this api to make anything...right?
yup
that sounds like someone forgot an &
...
one step away from these functions and yet so far
thats ... weird?
well that's nice
only way to get EntityNPC is through the NPC Update callback
so when you are looping through room entities you will never have a EntityNPC but only Entity
for example did you know that ToNPC is not a cast but a clone
easier to search through HAH
I've been using that more than the docs
ahh good old metatable
i feel like i'm close ```[INFO] - Lua Debug: __index:function: 00D34120

maybe
hmm
you could ask those who wrote the tuts on r/moddingofisaac to put these up on your wiki
its pretty sparse right now but im sure it'll get some contributors adding information soon
hi <@174193097285173250> i added some stuff to the gamepedia for modding documentation http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Modding
you?
cool
and reading the suggestions I got yesterday
<@174193097285173250> trying to create a new item for my mod
yeah ive done that obviously.
mine says hiding:AddCallback but you should have <yourmodname>:AddCallback
no, are you using my code exactly? because your mod class is called something else right?
any idea whats this from, does AddCallback require an additional argument or what?
<@122924009527574530> im getting the following error with your code:
[INFO] - ERR: resources/scripts/main.lua:7: bad argument #4 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got table)
what are you guys doing right now ?
ah
no, it's the "pop" animation
oh wait
that should have his own file right?
latter is the flat penny trinket I think
you can check my mod for some code examples
https://github.com/olafurw/the-hiding-of-isaac/blob/master/main.lua
where are these 2 used?
quick question
ohhhhh, ok thank you
check your log.txt file if it's not, may be a code error
function hiding:PlayerInit(aConstPlayer)
end
hiding:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, hiding.PlayerInit)
ya
does MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT even trigger? its not doing anything for me
eh i'll guess i'll first just replace some coins with rupees
_shrug_
but theres no way to access the config to any item, is there?
do you know of a mod that uses this?
c++ class
well, not a table really
the table for the item itself?
config::item is the item's actual definition
I'll post here when I know
nope
even thought that if I would instance an item and give it to the costume
last night was me saying this again and again
exactly
What the fuck is an Config::item
there is a AddCostume function, just trying to get it to work
well yeah you could modify the Sprite of the standard isaac, and drop it in your mod...
if I want to force isaac to wear a certain costume?
and correct name ofc
in the correct folder structure
if you want to swap gfx of an existing thing, drop the new gfx in your mod folder.
any link to example stuff?
how do I swap out gfx?
...well, it's still kind of slow loading from ssd
_headdesk_
also dunno what causes it (most likely a bug) but most of the animations of his main form are missing
because fucking sd card
right
... oh
... oh look, isaac just freezes at a white screen on my surface--oh, there it goes
and it teleports out of nowhere
imo...
it's basically a sped up boss rush!
kinda lazy...
just fight it and you'll see
what's wrong with the final boss exactly
atleast that's all i could make up off of it from a few screenshots on the steam forums
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5m3aau/on_antibirth_and_afterbirth_compatibility/
the final boss doesnt have to do anything with it
they do, but not with the current state of the final boss of AB+
more that they want to do the reverse
last i heard
well the antibirth guys dont want to move the mod over
I mean come on, not even Starbound is this derpy
at this point antibirth is looking to become the "actual" modding platform
i just want to add a new item but basic stat adding isn't even possible without workarounds
i just dumped the globals table which helped a bit but the lead died real fast
just wanted to add a costume
fucking thing sucks
yea I gave up on Config::Item last night
Config is ItemConfig and the tables are there but empty, so zzz
hey ilise
still trying to figure out how to get my shit to work
still trying to find the missing functionality
reasonable
how's everybody doing?
i doubt its called on resume, doesnt make sense to me, buut ill try it out now. ill let you know
my character gets instagibbed the moment you resume a run since he technically has no hp and isn't The Lost <.<
also, does it get called on resume?
begginning of the run, every new room, every new floor?
Do you guys know when exactly MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT is called?
first mod ported to ab+ ? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835149267
http://pastebin.com/8w9JZ3PX
so i am trying to create this item but i think this is completely wrong
Hmm, interesting post on the subreddit. It gives some info on callback functions arguments https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m2gk6/moms_knife_guppy_mod/
the projectile params class gives you lots of nice attributes, but it seems like the methods are missing as <@77068961144909824> said
Game has a GetItemPool() method, but the return type is ItemPool, which you can't handle without some retroengineering
ok
But you certainly can't use the lua API for that, because you guessed it right: Item_Pool is a class that is not documented, only referenced at.
I don't know. I'm not looking in that domain.
then have we already found a way to add items to the item pool?
ok
I put up my first mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835115052
It seems like you can't because you need a class that is not documented in the API yet, only refered to: Entity_Tear.
how can you change how tears fly
LUUL
can we add items to itempools now?
Ahah, I prototyped a great little challenge.
no
anyone know a better way to set coins to 0 than
num_coins =  getnumcoins 
addcoins(-num_coins)
it's really useful!
hahaha
I mean the freaking Unlock Console Mod has more subs than mine FeelsBadMan
I'm gonna credit you ilise rose for that idea ?
k thx
ohh nice
I just updated now with harder enemies and a score for every room you clear hidden
<@120355885615808512> As far as I heard, no
ya
are you the stealth mod person?
I'll try that for the next version
lol
entity.Target = entity lol
Shit my mod has 1000 subscribers, this is getting crazy
ilise how?
any news? can we mod  custom items in itempools? set stats?
thank you all for your help
<@122924009527574530> i got them to stand still by just setting their targets to themselves?
that does indeed work
```lua
if player:GetDamageCooldown() == 0 then
     -- use your gd item
end
```
I found it
using razor blade gives you invulnerability, just not from yourself
Hm maybe the problem isn't the invuln at all
yeah still doesn't fix invuln
Well, that doesn't prevent using it during the invincibility frame
as follow:
```lua
player:TakeDamage(1,
        DamageFlag.DAMAGE_IV_BAG | DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS,
        EntityRef(player), 0)
```
the damage flags are all using bitshifting, so each byte corresponds to setting that flag
yes with the `|` operator
wait actually can I add multiple flags at once?
Try the flag DAMAGE_IV_BAG
I want it to be like razor blade where it's instant but there's no invuln involved
the problem is that since the active costs health, you're able to spam it after you get hit but before you can take damage again
there is invuln time
not a great solution but it should work
if there is, don't do anything?
wait, can't you just check if there is invuln time <@134478547795443712> ?
`maxcharges="0"` works for me
set it to 0
im still trying to find a way to make an active without charges
SO
Btw, deleting maxcharges doesnt let you use the item without charges
it also just lets you spam it when you're invulnerable
and the DamageFlag.DAMAGE_INVINCIBLE doesn't work either
interesting
didn't change invulnerability at all actually
nope didn't work
when you call it it automatically makes him vulnerable so it could very well affect you if you used the item while in iframes
and that won't ruin anything? it'll just effect the item?
i was using that to making isaac invuln forever so i assume you can use it to make him vulnerable instantly
player:SetMinDamageCooldown(0)
how
you can SetMinDamageCooldown to 0 i think <@134478547795443712>
entity.child helped me colour the brimstone splash particle
right now you can gain infinite life
Damn. how do I remove invulnerability time for this active item
Any clue on what the Entity.Parent and .Child does? I tried using them to find what is the source of projectiles, but to no avails.
I made them charmed
it's the dumbest idea ever
so it's all good
indeed it is
I fucking got the enemies to roam randomly
spawn in a razor blade and check? shrug
is that how razor blade works too though?
it only damages the half soul heart
if you have half a soul heart and one red heart
one weird problem
it was hard xD
my god
yeah i got it too
yep, we same
is what did it for me
player:TakeDamage(2, DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS, EntityRef(player), 0)
okay
I figured it out
ye
did you use TakeDamage? <@135254843567767552>
cause i did if you're still stuck
<@134478547795443712>  did you get it?
Someone posted on the subreddit a script to extract data from the doc .html page to use them for autocompletion in Sublime. Gotta look into that to port it to Atom.
or you get damaged
<@252687592024309761> i think thats to trigger a passive item when someone hits you
format guide is in the discussion page
hey guys, if you know what the functions do feel free to add them to this page on the wiki http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Classes
<@134478547795443712> there is a MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG in the modcallback enum. are you using that at all?
ty
k
i.e.     <active description="For Testing!" gfx="test_button.png" name="Testing Button" />
just don't use maxcharges at all
the item just doesnt work
If you put maxcharges="0"
Btw, has someone figured out how to make an item without charges? like guppys paw
thanks xD
oh my god
ooook
i think im starting to get how to do more things
The enumerators are listed in the group___enumerations.html page of the doc, it's a lot of stuff, you only need to look at it when they are refered to in other parts of the doc.
ok
all those things are on the docs
oh
thanks
i get it
ok
oh
A flag is a constant value to which you gave a name, so intead of remembering a number, you need to remember a name (easier) to use it.
DamageFlag is the name of the enumerator type and DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS is the name of the flag. You type DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS because you want the flag DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS in the enumerator DamageFlag.
<@216324079504982016> yeah, thats the best expression to define my life rn
maybe its just a dumb question
and where did you code damageflag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS?
whats a flag?
so
and programming in general
im learning right now how to program in lua
can i ask you a question
but
it makes sense
hmm
*file
and local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0) is earlier in the program
the code I'm trying to use is:
player.TakeDamage(2, DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER, 0)
the documentation says:
boolean Entity::TakeDamage    (float Damage,
integer     Flags,
EntityRef     Source,
integer     DamageCountdown 
)
I'm trying to use the Entity::TakeDamage() function to damage the player on an activated item
can someone experienced help me out
You'll find most success downloading a mod that creates a custom challenge and looking into how they do it
how can i make my own custom challenge?
think I just found out the damage <@132627275307810817>
until someone figures it out
I'm just gonna freeze them at this point
o_o
but they still run for isaac
best I've gotten is stuttering every few ms
I've tried them all
and some Pathfinder functions don't do anything or just return false
in either sense
I can't change the target
i know what that means
I think it's const-ref as in "you can change what this points to, but you can't change the thing behind it"
zeta enlighten me
you can assign to that from lua and it does definitely work
look at Sprite.Color, for example
they suck
<@122924009527574530> actually, not quite how it works
Fucking luadocs
guess I'm skipping that functionality
always, hardcoded
enemies will always target isaac
Target is const
getmetatable(aNpc) has my answr
I'm going to stop using the docs
oh god I hate these tools
HAHA I fucking found it
it didnt work for me
or at least
that doesnt work
addhearts(-2)?
I have DamageFlag.DAMAGE_RED_HEARTS as a parameter but I'm lost on how to actually damage the player entity
Thats what im trying to do too
anyone know a way you can damage yourself with an active item?
Uhh, I just saw the twitch integration mod on reddit. That sounds really cool
sorry, I've been going mad all morning
or people make 1-2 line things
and there are no mods that do anything with code, it's like im alone here, everybody's doing skins
it's like the game resets the target every frame
MoveRandomlyAxisAligned(1.0, false) makes them stutter every 10ms but they still follow isaac
I'm doing this in debug as well
all of them return void
how do you damage an entity
evadetarget returns void
are you sure those don't return a vector to just pass into movement?
I just want the damn things to not follow isaac
nope
aNpc:ResetPathFinderTarget()
nope
aNpc.Pathfinder:MoveRandomlyAxisAligned(1.0, false)
nope
aNpc.Pathfinder:EvadeTarget(Isaac.GetRandomPosition())
half the things dont do anything
fucking god damn mod tools
for now i just test my items with the console
Ill try messing with that later
hmmm
yup, itempools.xml, and I tried to copy the same format at the existing itempools.xml file in the actual game resources
Did you create a new file in the mod folder right?
I tried messing with it, but it just ends up crashing the game
i guess you have to do that in item_pools.xml
nope
I guess it also doesn't show how to add items to item pools
Np
oh I found them, thanks
But not much
From that you can learn how to make an item
I mean
Yeah
the hothead
...edmund posted a mod?
Just follows that
The mod that edmund posted
I mean, it makes sense, but we didn't exactly get documentation about it. How was this figured this out so quickly?
and then in each folder
in resources
And the .png .wav and those
Must go in content folder
I think all the .xml like items.xml and those things
Hmmm
maybe the handle should be one pixel thicker
So wait, how were we supposed to figure out the whole content folder thing anyways

the problem is
like in the base game
There you just write a new line of the players
ah
if you want to add a new cahracter you just have to make a new file in the content folder and you have to name it players.xml
http://previews.123rf.com/images/galdzer/galdzer1201/galdzer120100070/11938297-box-cutter-knife-Isolated-on-white-background-Stock-Photo.jpg
like
maybe you can add a bit of the "razor" on the orange part

...how did you add a new character?
how' this for a box cutter sprite

xD
But the menu is bugged for that char
At least im happy cause i added a new character
Yeah
Well
I bet that there's a lot that we can do, just the documentation is too vague to know what's even going on
There are a lot of things that it seems we cant do
I hope they keep updating the api or something
There is pointers to so much more, plus those stat effect setters not existing is very telling.
From the looks of it, it doesn't seem very powerful. There looks to be a lot of hard-coded stuff like tile types and enemies, and from what I can tell I can't register new ones
It seems like it has undergone the same process than the item pool in Afterbirth when it released
Yeah, the API reference and the API itself seems pretty bare-bones. I hope that it gets expanded in the future.
and i cant find shit
I just look at the documentation
so don't give up hope
edmund said he'll release a couple today though
oh
n o p e
Btw, is there any way to look at the bbase game items .lua or something like that?
sweet
I mean, in the base game
so
There isnt any box cutters
Out as well, this time for good
cya
Cya
*ollies outy*
i'mma go to sleep, see you in six months--ewwwwwww a box cutter  >_P
pencil sharpener
Those things, if sharp enough can cut skin.
is there a box cutter item
Oh yeah man
wtf
Yeah, I'll do it once people have figured it out. x3 I'm too lazy to experiment where I've no experience.
guitar pick???
holy shit
http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/emo/answers/show/469072/what-use-make-wrist-bleed
BUt figuring out what to write so they do what you want is really hard
Making them isnt that hard
okay i think i've officially passed the exhaustion coherency threshhold
Same
Yeah
they just don't do what I want them to
I mean I have
So nobody's figured out making items right? x3
Wouldn't expect less from emtony feitano
looooovely
http://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/self-injury/10-ways-people-self-harm-self-injure/
we can look here for ideas
which is pure shit
woooooooo
also +5 range when that happens
hit as in taking damage
low chance on hit to spawn a pickup and activate the anemic effect
Imo it's really shitty
I mean
damn it
it's also a really really lame item
Shit
<@164161524401831936> <@134478547795443712>  just checked it, it is a new item in ab+
pfffff
nice
No
Whoa, you can edit your messages on discord?
Guess who cant sleep
x3
I wanna help dammit
i think a shard of glass is already an item in ab+ actually
I dunno.
wut
x3
lmao
A sandle with broken glass on the inside?
that
yeah
shard of glass
Yeah
oo good idea
Is that even a thing
maybe broken glass with blood?
Especially stainless steels ones from taiwan. Those buggers are too sharp xD
Scissors can cut you easily.
Broken heart, then you make it a photorealistic heart with some sort of heart disease.
what's something people use to cut themselves
Yeah
Right
Razor blades is like the most obvious thing, but it does exist on the base game
other items in the game are like blood rights (a razor blade), razor blade (also a razor blade)
I think it has to be something that cuts
A belt isaac ties around his neck? Flavor text "Soul leaving the body"
I dunno
xD
dunno
Bloody razor blades attached to a bracelet?
Maybe this belt that people used to punish themselves
Like Wipe?
Yes, that is where my mind went directly
Hmm
i guess?
something self-mutilation related
But. Anyone have an idea for the flavor of that item? Cause I'm lost
Just gotta figure out how to do items. xD
k thanks
then come back and tell you
I'm gonna write some code for a couple minutes
I saw how to do it today
Tho, once people figure the tools out, since you KNOW almost everyone's pouring throguh them right now, I igmagine mod making's just gonna explode, for better and mostly worse. x3
how did you make the item so it does dmg to the player?
Well, maybe not specifically a red heart
<@134478547795443712>
k great
I don't think so?
<@164161524401831936> does razor blade ruin devil deals? cause it'll be like that
Help me ?
Yes, this should be possible plumbus!
what the FUCK IS A SUBTYPE GUYS
How do you make an item that deals half heart dmg to isaac? I know how to make an item, but the documentation is a fucking mess and i cant really find what im looking for
IIIStrife... good luck. I don't even know most of the stuff in the room editor
As long as it doesn't actually count as red heart damage in terms of devil room chances  :P
it is not _hard_ to use the lua api they have in place...there's just a bunch of stuff not supported
Yeah
fuck it I want to release a mod tonight. What do you guys think of an active item that deals a red heart of damage to you and drops a half soul heart?
examples for everything
I mean... Can't be harder than Starcraft 2's map editor to do osmething simple right?
i mean't more like
yeah
But they had flawed syntax so what great examples they ended up being ?
Hi
Right, so they're effectively molecular manipulators without instruction manuals and only one expert in the world? xD
Tyrone *did* release example mods
Yes, everytime you or anything shoots.
We are slowly figuring it out
etc
bosses
Unable to figure out how to make items
Well, I made a screeshake mode, I'm quite happy with it.
Meaning a lot of users were left in the dust...
Tyrone never released example mods, or a really good documentation for the tools
that should say something about the state of modding
unless i wasn't paying attention and somebody did but i'm pretty sure nobody did
since your out of the loop, heres the recap
green isaac is still the best mode out
Well, <@!161994182125158412>
i'll just leave it at that
we have yet to figure out how to make stat boost
I'm a dumb smart person
Latter is the first one right? x3
the latter
Wait, broken as in "Really good it's stupid" or are they "Literally not working"? xD
be warned: you won't make it out alive
pick your poison
and are all fucking broken
Oh, okay, I get it. xD
cya ppl
each one has a deadly tool that has a different cause...
there will be a folder called "tools"
open up your game directory
time for a tutorial!
THERE IS NO NIGHT LEFT
IIIStrife...
When you check the type of the thing that dealt damage, it says it was the player itself if you have brim or tech.
ITS NOT NIGHT
Okay, no idea how, how do I open the dev tools with antibirth+?
night kyozm. or, morning. as it were.
hopefully when i come back we have the keys to the kingdom
Have fun sleeping
goodnight <@266032468853915650>
Okay what the actual fuck.
ok bois i'm of 2 slep
(i mean, look at doom)
and takes over development
the community goes wild
and your game is very big
70 years after Edmund's death
like seriously if you make your game opensource
OpenRebirth when
oh, that would make sense actually
<@134478547795443712> That and Rebirth may have proprietary dependencies which would be illegal to redistribute
the end
step 2
include it with afterbirth+
wont get any worse
step 1
they release isaac drm-free
how to fix source code problem
please
heres how you fix it
Yes
ITS SO FAR FROM THE BASE GAME
what is the reasoning behind not releasing the source code? pirating?
LOOK AT DOOM'S MODS
like SERIOUSLY
^
the end
release the fucking source code
take a look at doom
i mean, do you guys wanna know how you really do modding support?
absolutely nothing, it would be an improvement, is what i'm saying
nothing
what's wrong with c++ though
^
without lua they probably would have written afterbirth+ in c++ or something
granted, its very poor modding support
without it, i doubt we would have modding support at all
fuck you and your opinions
BUT
pretty
yes it isn't very...
LUA is great, its small and works efficently
roll the dice, pay the price
make it increase two random stats, and luck by 1?
the odds are with you
but it could save your run
xd
see also: cursed eye
<@266032468853915650> feels like experimental treatment. Any item that can completely fuck up your run if you take it isn't a good ide
awww c'mon its just a callback
dont RT yourself please
<@164161524401831936> you reposted in the wrong neibourhood
This is definitely true, documentation is lackluster and difficult to read. But that means we should hold ourself to better standards by writting better code
C and C++ are both prettymuch like "If you try and do anything cute to a variable after it's declared I will fucking cut you."
fortune cookie -> all stats chantge 2 up or down
i'm gonna make it so there's a 65% chance it goes up
to justify picking it up, at least
or alternatively a pot full of molten iron and a half-chopped-down tree
^
huge differece
Although it might just be because prototyping anything in AB+ basically amounts to hitting yourself in the face with a hammar until you find the right function and objects by dumb luck.
lua is a dynamic lang while C is static
why, lua cant understand C
You should also do that in C, unless you use variables like HasStuff to hold the number of items in a list
^
thank you someone understands
I'm a python programmer, and lua is fuckawful.
its summer here
goodness gracious
time to go to sleep
sun's already up
well shit
i'm a C programmer to the core
i hate lua
<@266032468853915650> nice mod you have here! But I would recommend doing
```lua
if not hasFortuneCookie ... then
   -- code
end
```
rather than `hasFortuneCookie == false` or similar, it would make your code easier to read.
like 9joao6's custom throne...
I have an idea for a ten commandments active item that scales up in how powerful the effect is based on how many times you use it
or a "helper"
i would love it if someone made a drag-and-drop program
I've also never coded in lua before today. it's a struggle. also I find it really hard to read
edmoind mecmoole
i wonder if you could conceivably actually balance an item that raises your damage like that. maybe by having it cap and loop around to negative damage for a short time, so you have to time your shots so you don't accidentally heal the enemy?
"The next week or so will all about difficulty tuning, bug fixing and mod support"
oh well... update later today... maybe we will get something then
its a start plumbus
that is all.
I have figured out how to drop a consumable when you pick up an item
TYYYRROOONE
we will die before that happens
pretty sure tyrone forgot to add it
aww
no
I've been out for half a day. Did anyone figure out how to modify tears or stats yet?
alright
but its capped at 60
depends on how fast it can calculate
60 ticks per second ya?
pardon my ignorance, but how long is a "tick" in this context, anyway
so you get that many items from it
bosses become a number of flies proportionately equal to their max health
ye
and all the enemies are flies
and it stacks
everytime
it drops from flies
wonder where that came from
pretty balanced I think
great idea
wow!
passive item that increases your damage by 2 every tick
mod idea
unless you do
you dont want +2 dmg every tick
good for status effects
you can run it only when its picked up
but if you have hasItem variable
yes
does the function every tick
ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m2gk6/moms_knife_guppy_mod/
Did you see the guppy mod on the subreddit?
i can 99% guarantee i am the purest code virgin
You can feed input variables into a function from the callback that calls it.
i dont think you understand what a callback is
Fuck me sideways, I still have no idea what objects the game is giving me in MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE
you'd do the effect 10000000 times
so does this with one callback
this code runs on every tick
plum
if player:HasCollectible(itemname)==true then
hey so, this code only dictates whether or not you have the items, right? there's nothing about the actual effects of the items in this particular code, right?
what about like
aaaAAAAAAAAAAAHH
ITS THURSDAY MY DUDES
lua is really lightweight
but it runs well
i suppose
there's no better way to tell if you got a passive item
maybe i'm just a pleb but this seems like the most painfully inefficient way to code whether or not you have an item
your next mod should add some new enemy alts
Awesome!
i belive this would help begginers alot lol

i mean i could make a modding blog post
i click -- wait what
guys edmund is making ab+ great again
OH WAIT
fuck
is as close of a blog post as a i get
and android is not
cause ios is open source

why does ios phones get rebirth but us android users don't

FUCK TYRONE <@266032468853915650> WILL MAKE THE BLOG POST, HE WILL MAKE THE WIKI AND WORK ON AFTERBIRTH+ FOREVER
this is looking good
look at all of edmund's tweets
it might just give us THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
let's be optimistic
i dont actually understand either, even though i made gmod mods
inb4 the post is useless
But I honestly don't know how this code stuff really works so I'm basically just blowing hot air to try and be funny and lighten the mood  :P

https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/816916483171196928
PAPA BLESS
like we are literally doing the same exact shit
barely do anything powerful
but apparently the tools we have now
i mean afterbirth and below modding was limited
But nooooOOOOOOOOOoooooo
it's really puzzling honeslty. I've been looking through the unpacked resources because SURELY the items' code would be INCLUDED in those unpacked resources considering they were probably previous PACKED so that they could actually be used by the GAMe
appearantly a list of functions and variables is enough.
but no
like all of my item ideas I could piece together by looking at other existing items
I know right
but... you can't! ~ o/
you might be able to find somethign for that if you could look at the monster manuel code
hey <@134478547795443712> , don't expect to get any answers... afterbirth+ communication has been really shitty
rockin kyozm
or familiars that only last for one room and then delete themselves when you walk through a door?
haha cool
all hooked up now
Does anyone know how to make effects last for just the current room?
ok now theres boss rooms with subtypes of 2
the only thing to do right now with it is trial and error
official documentation makes me want to die
that'd be nice
from an offical documentation
i sure would love an explanation for it
that makes no sense
bwop bwop bwop bwooooo
theres a lot of boss rooms that have a subtype of "1"
ok for fucks sake my theories wrong
looks kinda like a paper mario 64 item
that's better
remade the sprite
that makes sense
im guessing the boss rush one has a subtype where its similar to 1, but starts boss rush
like when you pick one, it removes the other one
1 apparently makes all item pedestals behave like theres a "choice"
0 is your average room
ok, subtypes seem to make the room have different "effects"
anywhere but the development chennel
apologies if I'm asking in the wrong place here, but a user on steam told me people over here are happy to provide feedback on mods? where would be the best channel for that?
that's a bigass fortune cookie
random stat up

3rd item bois
i think, despite the medium and appropriate location in which you are voicing your query, you may be asking the wrong crowd
Anybody know how to get information out of dmg_dealer in an MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback besides type?
"delete" WAIT THAT DELETED THE WHOLE ROOM
oh no i placed a key by mistake, how do i get rid of it
fucking sticky nickels, i'd like the kick the guy in the shins whose brain became host to that thought and didn't immediately and violently eject it into the stratosphere
im getting downvoted on this post because i was salty i guess
okay it's just a random coin, mystery solved
even if the question mark on the penny causes me doubt
ezpz
i have succeeded in placing a penny. i'm going to call that a success
BECAUSE SOMEONE FORGOT TO ADD GOOD DOCUMENTATION
took me and my friend about 30 minutes to figure out
yeah its a mess to set up
also really appreciating how the room editor refuses to open without an error despite me not touching anything since unpacking the resources. A+
like theres item rooms with different ones as well
but its not specific to bosses
like each boss has its own
~ ~ I have no idea ~ ~
its really odd
well, that's um... hm.
go to the room editor, under "room id" theres the thingy im talking about
that is curious though
oh well there ya go, case closed, we cracked the code. what a sample size  :P
where are you getting a subtype anyway
and the hush fight has 63
for example, a regular room has 0
room subtypes are a number
for treasure, curse, etc
ffs
along with a number and a selection list
thats apart of "room id"
sadly no
i'm assuming room "type" is like, normal, treasure, curse, shop, etc?
couldn't tell ta
what is a room subtype
i dunno what's in Ambush, BossID, MultiShotParams, LRoomAreaDesc, LRoomTilDesc etc etc
but im going to reask a question
well i mean about 10 hours
alright, its been a day
bunch of userdata that isn't documented
well i can't speak for everyone but, that's the vibe i'm getting
honestly, looking at the documentation, there are just a bunch of things that we literally have no access to
I wanted to ask if "GetVictoryLap" returns 0 if you're not on a victory lap, but I'd be surprised if anyone's even tried that function yet
pretty much
Man, normally this would be the channel I troubleshoot or ask mod questions to do I assume everyone is just as in the dark as I am
oh geez
i haven't watched any of nl's content on this game since i've been watching cobaltstreak and richardhammer's marathon
tyrone's blame-pushing onto nl i mean
well if you blame tyrone anyway then that blame-pushing didn't really work
probably made afterbirth+ bad, DIRECTLY
but tyrone says northerlion
too much "x is y so this item is bad"
i blame tyrone
i blame bisnap
he's too Canadian to blame. he would actually apologize for it
nuuu not northernlion, spare the egg
riot northerlion everyone
http://image.prntscr.com/image/0b80e9e484ed4c40b3c680ebe72eee3f.png
robo baby 2.0 is screaming did i do a bad
mmm.
judging from the room editor
Like, if they're the same entity but they pull from different "enemy pools" on each floor, maybe?
i don't think they do
Depends on whether different floor portals share an entity ID, probably.
I have no idea btw
for what it's worth
He got a friendly skullhead guy and it couldn't die so he basically got a free Peeper's Eye
Do the enemies spawned change from floor to floor, or does a floor 1 portal always spawn floor1 enemies?
That is amazing
W.O.W
use a friend ball on them and they spawn endless friendly enemies
Actually a friend of mine found a really funny synergy with those portals today
Cuz you'd have no idea what changed
i wish there was a pill that removed portals permanantly throughout your entire run
That'd actually be a good effect for the ??? pill effect.
i wish there was a pill that would just reroll one item in your run. could be one of your useless items and help you or it could fuck you in multiple ways
and faster
i damn well hope not
like can you make them keep going faster
do the pills stack?
"hello do you like bomb spiders and mom spiders how about if they were FASTER"
gg

got really screwed over on an L room on the catacombs by that excited!!! pill
good, more pills to never take
oh
i heard that they slow/speed up rooms
Slows down/Speeds up enemies on the room
nothing??
what do drowsy/excited do?
you know what item i like a good amount? acid baby. also, i REALLY wish they would have added more interesting pill effects rather than more useless ones
hopefully later some css master can come in and make this look fancier
np
thank you
alto, your a legend
see: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2354
though i am a writer on the SCP wiki
no
I'd love to know the story behind that typo
Are you the actual Alto Clef? Like from the SCP wiki?
if you want to hel hmu
ok bois i upped the scope of my ItemExpansion mod from 3 items to 5
gonna turn it into a template later
just an example page
Might opt to give stat bonuses rather than an item, for balance purposes
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/AddBlackHearts
alright how does this look
http://i.imgur.com/jYwvMhg.png
oh hey, guess i could show this: sprite for "wrath of the lamb", eden's blessing-style item that'd drop from the Lamb
also i don't know when it will be possible or ever possible, but there needs to be more variety when you breakfast. it's an old idea, but you can have all the different stat ups and maybe an item that gives 2 soul hearts over a red heart
i think rounded edges look good.
ba dum tss
not as EDGY though
yeah, looks better
oh i see
or, corners. whatever.
rounded edges yo
whats the difference
That looks good imo. Would fit right in alongside Brimstone and Whore of Babylon
new sprite or old sprite?
So no, I don't think so
cant even make a dmg up
tyrone made a pooping monstro ?
i would love an example
has anyone made one yet?
I feel like getting an HP up from a demon judgement is weird
define new monsters
does anyone know how to create new monsters yet?
demon beggar doesn't get enough truly demonic items
round the edges and it'll look great
curse and demon beggar
updated heresy sprite
i'm thinkin' curse. too demonic for a boss item, not quite enough for a devil deal
what item pool would you put the demon heart in?
i mean
also provides a reroll pedestal in devil rooms you otherwise wouldn't get
-> great idea
so you can get the key pieces even if you have devil precedent
fallen angel statues spawn in devil rooms
actually that might work
will the API support it? xd
what could possibly go wrong
angel statues randomly fall from the sky
oh shit
the description i chose is: Angels Fall
well, what's possible in isaac and what's possible in this, perhaps the greatest modding api ever invented by man, are two very different things
plus, it's obviously possible for isaac to move in directions other than cardinals or diagonals considering analog input is possible with a controller
trying to think of an effect for heretic has really made it clear how vague and nebulous the term "heresy" is
i already mentioned this
yes - where are the diagonals?
if you know the direction he's going you can figure out a vector
Direction
enum Direction
Enumerator
NO_DIRECTION     
LEFT     
UP     
RIGHT     
DOWN
wow aren't you humble
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834041002
all i can get is a "Direction" which doesn't represent diagonals at all
i can't let you know how cool greenissac is
is it possible to get a VECTOR for isaac's desired movement direction
oh i'm backed in a corner
u insultin greenisaac?
u say what is mediocre?
yeah that sounds good
Since the icon looks so cool, you should make it extremely mediocre
HERETIC: MAKE ISAAC GREEN
Should double-thick Heretic's outlines
Heretic: no idea
Demon Heart: HP+ DMG+ Faith- Angel-
right back at me
or perhaps moreso: what are they intended to do in the future
ur mom sounds like a cool item
is that still a problem. i don't even know
i'll put ur mom in an item pool
what do they do
nice. now put them in an item pool.
yooooo
eyy
Screaming yellow zonkers chant
they couldn't think of a name so they opened up to ad agencies, and the product was eventually named "Screaming Yellow Zonkers" by a *boutique*
**LORE**
this has gotta be the weirdest lore about a snack food i've ever heard
I need this valuable information
How do i mate them
Oh
allllllrighty then
"While the front of the package was simple and understated, the rest of the Zonkers box was completely covered with absurdist copy, accompanied by illustrations, informing the reader everything from how to wash Zonkers to how to mate them"."
sounds like an item that would spawn those little yellow dart flies
No its screaming, yellow and zonkers
Apparently it's "popcorn" in a "yellow sugary glaze".
is it a knock off of cracker jacks?
I need to make an item called Screaming Yellow Zonkers now
- Screaming Yellow Zonkers
- List of popcorn brands; okay, sure
- Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs; wtf
- Poppycock
- Prizes; ya don't say
yay i made a necronomicon that kills all non-boss enemies and does 100 damage to bosses
cant belive that this is the guy that rated my mod up
- Crunch 'n' Munch
- Fiddle Faddle
pretty standard issue brand names, alright alright
- Caramel Popcorn; makes sense
related articles on "cracker jacks":
pfffff  XD
the steak is just getting cooked ?
not chatting about cool mod ideas and spreading positivity or anything  :P

time well spent
you know I've wasted like 2 days of my life just chatting in this discord about how bad this API is
i don't think we have cracker jacks in canada??
nah it was just a bag of caramel popcorn
it's a bag in a box*
it has like nuts in it as well though
BAG?
i just opened a bag of that today, actually. what a weird coincidence.
yes
oh it's like that caramel popcorn apparently?
disgusting "snack"
cracker jacks is weird popcorn shit
they really couldn't have put cookie crumbs around his mouth or something?
like, cracker jacks are a cookie, right?
they do stupid shit
he's like 6
except then he holds on to the box for... some reason

he has the trinket in the cracker jacks box
also there are some items that isaac holds in his hand too, like cracker jacks??????
i wish i had 20 feet so i could flow down a set of stairs like a non newtonian fluid
but you can't hold an equal sign in your hand. that's just stupid
yeaaaahh
he mentions nothing of the modding though
it's cool for, say, brimstone to just be a symbol, since it's like, a nebulous magic power up
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/816802786411057152 there is hope
chance for 1+1 pickup <@135254843567767552>
because i mean, trinkets are supposed to be things you can actually physically hold, right
i've never seen the item in game so i dunno what it even does
<@135254843567767552> inconclusive
well no matter how bad the trinket art is at least it isn't Second Hand
it's not just an equal sign?
it's obviously a sideways jetpack
<@164161524401831936> thats exactly what it is

brb gonna upload the new nine inch nails ep to the workshop
what, is it actually two mini-hot dogs or something
nah, if it's a symbol it probably shouldn't have shading at all
one step towards a better mankind
upload it to the workshop
fixed

since the example mods, he has added number parameters to two things to require the mods to work, one of which is literally not in the documentation
i feel like they knew that the community is what made their game great that they expected the community to make their MODDING tools great as well
They need to be fixed by hand to work in AB+
Those preprovided sample mods Tyrone handed out are broken
<@102194039104737280> I'm sure someone already said as much but the funniest thing is
remember all the "previews" of the mod stuff tyrone was showing with AB+ that literally was just stuff we could already do
I'd love to see him take a big fat nosedive into the HTML doc and see how much sense he can make out of it
the mod support is so easy to use! here's nothing more than reskins (totally doable pre-afterbirth+)
granted even antibirth has "passive item but worse" trinkets. I'm still not sure why jawbreaker exists
I love how he posts random spriteshit that has nothing to do with, you know, the API
guys i found a lie https://twitter.com/KingoftheMemers/status/816751337056665600
yup, yet another "passive item but worse" trinket
1+1 =
it's actually just the sequel to humbling bundle
there are so many possible effects they could've made that would fit with "equality"
"what does the equal sign do" "well it's got two lines..."
wtf
doesn't make any fucking sense
that's some illuminati theory numerology shit there
which i guess could be represented by the fact that the equal sign has two lines???????
last i checked platinumgod it just randomly causes pickups to become 1+1 versions
Afterbirth+ is absolute trash
alright
the final nail in the coffin
it doesn't even do anything "equal" afaik
THATS NOT EQUAL ANYMORE

That has to be intentional
UNSATISFYING
can someone make a mod to fix all the capitalizations of items
bottom half, top right
where?
smh
inequal
lollll
THEY FORGOT A PIXEL ON EQUALITY
Which puts the burden of making it onto someone, but still :B
That's exactly why I was suggesting it be its own wiki
TYRONEEEEEEEEEEEE
>he barely worked on any of it
pretty sure doomspeaker will kill us for adding a hundred million pages to the wiki explaining shit that only we can understand but whatever
oh yeah the hearts
whatever analogs to the random spinning blank coins
yum heart x3
yea thats what im planning on doing
Could work as a dad's key, anarchist's cook book, or uhh...
Edmund is the designer, he doesn't do the programming afaik
<@129475107583295488> I'm not sure if it's right for the Rebirth wiki, I was thinking something like zdoom's wiki where each function has its own dedicated page explaining its purpose along with provided examples, like https://zdoom.org/wiki/ACS_Execute
I like that
thats a cool idea
ooh
Ohhhh
or something along those lines
yeah, i wanna set up an active that spawns coins like ultra greeds that'll give rewards based on what they roll
He barely worked on any of it tbh
Nah
did edmund even work on the API though, I don't know these things
They shouldnt have done any content so the API could function lmao
ugh i'm having trouble with this improved necronomicon i'm making. i'm trying to make it instantly kill anything that isn't a boss, but i don't know if it is the kill or die function on entities
so, any cool items ideas y'all have for when somebody actually cracks the code on it?
its pretty sparse right now but here you go http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Modding
I have had absolutely no fun messing with this API and I just go turn on AB+ for once to play it and I play this character who starts with a new entertaining active item, saying that they shouldn't have added new things to AB+ besides the API would've made it way worse as the new content is the only saving grace of the DLC (though it's still not worth the price at all)
yea sure
lmao
<@129475107583295488> can you link that?
okay this is really offtopic for <#205854782542315520>
its either die early or get stupid overpowered
yes, i believe everybody understands that apollyon is broken, mr. brightqwerty
There is no run that just chugs along
also, middling runs just dont exist anymore
I actaully have to fight to *not* get stupid OP
That doesnt mean he is completely fucking broken though
I play apollyon
Whenever I actually play AB+
Tbh
this will be great, thank you alto
hell yes, i understand what that means
I was originally trying to say I like that they added Apollyon as he's one of the most entertaining things in this DLC for me
right now im working on making a template for functions
i dunno about you but i laughed for like a minute straight at "Wait what?!"
alright, cool
it sometimes means nothing
im adding modding pages to the gamepedia
<@164110030671446016> robo baby is sentient
uh
whats with the facepalm for? i don't read the chat 4 hours straight
hey, how about that butter bean, am i right
Problem is you just dont have to pick items anymore
Hey, maybe this sounds like a dumb idea to people but is anyone working on an Isaac modding wiki? So that whenever someone here figures out what a function does it doesn't immediately get lost in a sea of chat
Except if you get stupid fucking items
oh alright, thanks
Yeah he can be entertaining
<@164110030671446016>  you should have a file named update.it in the folder for it, just delete it
Understand though that by definition we're all within the 90th-95th percentile of players. Apollyon is an Easyzel that does more compelling stuff than the original one.
I'm not saying Apollyon is good but he can be entertaining at least
If stone guys werent a total reskin + grimace it would be cooler
I think stone guys are fun. Just not on the first floor or with portals
K
eyy it's KK
Stone guys are p cool tbh
like a log or something
if your mod is listed as "old", isn't there a way to figure out why?
Actually I kinda like the stone guys, they're fun to dance around  :D
Mhm
I appreciate Apollyon as wish-fulfillment from every time I ever got Mom's Heels, but he's pretty lazily designed
they're the same size as the flesh counterparts but made of fucking stone
my hope for uisaac is gone
its isaac - D6 + Void
hey can we talk about, why the fuck are those stone boys so fast
arrghh i can't find it guys
its just an item
And apollyon inst even a character
my new mod idea
except for bullshit things early on
I find myself not having a chance of losing as Apollyon
which is a source of relief when I'm having horrible luck
Apollyon is just
more angel rooms, no soul hearts
I just need characters like Bethany and Apollyon for when I want to play a run of Isaac but I want it almost guaranteed not to suck
The thing is, when im beth, the meta changes up
oh
Heal the fires
what do they do on beth
oh wait really
you get one and its game over
for beth that is
yeeeep
They need to be nerfed as fuck
Imortal hearts are way to powerful
I can never keep the fires alive  :/
I am a dog
If you arent good it can drop of quick tho lmao
Beth is a good character in the early game
especially considering the single-use ones like mama mega and diplopia and pandora's
there is no more game
I have never gotten hit by a projectile as Bethany
goodbye all fun
<@266141401824100362> get mama mega on apollyon
book of virtues? you must know something i don't
Bethany
i wouldn't say the wisp summoning book is anywhere near as op as "eat and duplicate any active item"
Apollyon is busted but anyone who hates the item is anti-fun IMO.
Travoos, who?
if your luck is horrible you just need some great start to have a good run
beat delirium would be fine
The item itself is fucking broken
to be fair Antibirth has a character with a really OP starting item that I find fun
beat delirium
the item itself
yeah, like
Yeah but like
yeah
apollyon isn't supposed to be hard imo, he really should've had some intense unlock condition though
no chance to get something bad
Its like the D6 except always a benefit
Because spacebar charges, maaaaan
Except the stupid overpowered items
Why pick up anything??
So
and then active items just get eaten the fuck up as well
ab+ is so fucked
sometimes other stats
and turn them into damage or tears pretty consistently
You can just eat bad passives
Extremly
It's literally less than a week after launch, sheesh man
it's overpowered? jesus my runs must be horrible
LUL
Well then it'll probably get nerfed!
They got whoever was incharge of documenting the API to do it.
and destroys any meta of choosing items
rag mega is the best new sprite/portrait and just...that tels you how bad this is.
Apollyon's item is goddamn overpowered to shit
or somebody
agreed on the art tho, like there's a few of the new items and small monsters that look good and then i guess the artist left and they got tyrone to do the rest
GREEN ISAAC
rag mega is the best new sprite.
maybe "isaac but he is african american"
I like Apollyon's item, it's a ray of shining light compared to most of Afterbirth+
"I feel like all the artists left" same
Oh yeah man
allright ppl i'm back
I wonder what mods from this shitty first month Edmund is going to choose for his /boosterpack/
probably
yes
shouldn't that be locust of war
"locus of wrath"
I feel like all the artists left
oh yeah that reminds me
they're all so different
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/190232208882008065/266298165777399809/bullshit.png
also how can we forget nicalis' amazing creativity
<@132604813731954688> Cause I had the lost tranformation from using the clicker, and I haven't ever had it from looping.
You actually just turn into lost on loop 3
lol
hahaha
dangit
well pffffff maggy is just slow isaac with more health and a crappy --
maggie is just slow isaac with a healing spacebar item
<@266141401824100362> nope, didn't have the void.
his only thing is that he has 1 item
<@132604813731954688> Wierd question, but did you use the clicker right before you transformed into the lost/ did you absorb a remote with the void?
He isnt an interesting character
LUL
"content"
apollyon isnt cool though
apollyon is just isaac with a really OP spacebar item
Yup. They fucked looping.
with the API they delivered I'm glad this DLC has content
Apollyon is cool, I'll agree with that.
but all of it, SO MUCH OF IT, all lumped together
holy fuck i didnt know they fucked even looping
Oh yeah I like mushroom dues
the mushroom dudes are cool, apollyon is cool
the void, the final boss, the stone gapers, the portals
whether or not the content is "detrimental" remains to be seen until the post-launch rebalancing act is over
and let kilburn finish the API ages ago
just not fucking existed
i would be okay with a lot of these additions individually
or
and just made better API
Then they went "oh. wait. no we have stuff we want to add"
They shouldnt have done any content
Yeah. The original point of AB+ was to be just mod tools
and the content is detrimental anyway
AT FUCKING ALL
BUT IT DIDNT DELIVER
yuuuuup
I have actually seen people in that reddit say shit like "AB+ wasn't made to be a content expansion, it was made for the API which it delivered" and get upvoted over what it's responding to
things I dislike from AB+
- lmao id need a new keyboard
things I like from AB+
- Ministro
- Lil Monstro
- Animation editor maybe
probably because a lot of them aren't particularly affected by the shit api
Active item was gone
Had brimstone. Looped. Didn't have brimstone anymore
loud and clear and in an angry tone of voice
we are literally just stating facts
I dont know how the subreddit sees this as hatejerking tbh
I think it's around the same time as the Lost transformation
hm.
yup.
are you saying you just start losing items randomly
what
three extra cents. l i t e r a l l y  u n p l a y a b l e
Also. Items randomly disappear as you loop
tbf that may have been steam
they didnt even get the goddamn discount right
who even gives a shit about shop on the third loop. what could they possibly give you at that point
literally fucking nothing
point is, nothing they set out to accomplish was done well
But yeah. It was at least the same or later.
it might have been the same floor
lmao
So let me get this straight. In the linear difficulty progression of looping, you turn into the Lost BEFORE shops disappear.
its just to make it *challenging*
then ????????
nope
but you can't even get chieves on loops, can you?
I forget which one.
Thats how looping scales
And I believe shops disappear on the 3rd or 4th loop
Yup.
wait what
did you know on the 3rd loop you become the lost?
It's just those middling runs but even then who wants to do exactly the same shit over again for no extra benefit
that would have been fun at least
They could have made a victory lap through the void
basically
Yeah
The issue I have is, if your run is crazy powerful then looping is just a waste of time, but if it's super weak you just want to end the run, right?
you could make enemies just scale
just not like that
Looping could be good
Honestly though
Dunno
isn't it just beat ??? or the lamb?
how did they do it
i'm having a hard time getting a reading on the sarcasm levels here
and it could be better
you could even be fucking lazier then they were
like
no looping could be a good idea
"let's be like nuclear throne"
how do you do it
oh is it? i havent actually gotten to do that yet
yeah i'm not sure why that's even in.
but nah
I wish I could even just play that
also looping is *awful*
Mama Mega is dumbeeyon-t-tootie-thrust.
why play when you can just walk
goodbye game
mama mega = no fucking fun
cause that's fun
I like the "all the worlds are a stage" gimmick, honestly. I don't mind the Void or Delirium. And the music's awesome.
have i mentioned mama mega can cause guaranteed damage if a mushroom near a door decides to poison cloud when you enter
but it requires fucking work
Delirium could have been good
*le shrug*
Honestly
Void could have been good
I know the Void and all that was lazy and I wag my finger disapprovingly at Nicalis for using symbolism to get out of work
with a telefrag and basic bullet pattern
and the whole boss is still just a massive reskin
they arent good anyway
you can look at deliriums animations right now
yeah but like
I mean, the actual game expansion stuff just needs rebalancing. And Delirium's animations were confirmed bugged so that'll be fixed hopefully
I cant even do that :c
but
id love to just forget the new content
and even if you scrap all the content, the API isnt even worth it to use right now
portals are bullshit... i'm kinda tearing my own case down aren't it
well that's mostly subjective... except the new bosses they can go burn in hell
every new addition just feels like its fucking the game harder
this is like
Because when afterbirth launched it still had content that could be played and it was fun
This isnt just launch issues tho
i know that doesn't excuse it but
well if you look past launch issues and all this meta crap, the game itself is and has always been unironically fun and good
this is probably the wrong channel for this tho lmao
dont you think they should be putting a *bit* more effort into this?
does nicalis control an IP bigger then isaac though
castle in the darkness was good
Ending achieves at that
You mean the remake that has achieves that dont unlock *to this day?*
They also made the 1001 spikes remake
<:ULTRALUL:262414229276065802>
nicalis? didn't they make the cave story remakes?
They are like a first time dev rn
they *have* made other games, or am I remembering wrong? lmao
because talent
I cant personally attest
This is the information ive been provided
Yes
wait, if you can refund the dlc and keep it, couldn't you just send the dlc files to someone who only owns rebirth
even the internal checks are lazy
its like
How can I tell? steam has it as mixed reviews instead of afterbirths current very positive
that is true
for a good reason
people are being much harder on this
maaaaaaaaan, people were just as hard on afterbirth, "ohhhhh it's lazy nuhhh"
Good drm
because they didnt check that either
and just fucking play
and keep the game files
You can refund the game
also
really
wow
iirc
and it wouldnt disable achieves
you could even actually just manually install a Lua mod
Then at least you could say modding technically hasn't been set back, at least!  :D
What the fuck were they thinking
Nicalis did great on Rebirth/Afterbirth, but they got lazy with Afterbirth+.
nope
does that disable achieves
wait really
ye
is it still possible to mod it the same way people have before
but its a start
doesnt have anything in it
being bitter is k
alright i made a modding page on the gamepedia wiki
I dont want to fuel the "hatejerk" but everything they promised was done terribly so yanno
I feel pretty let down tbh
i'm not bitter, it's fine,
i think nicalis could benefit from watching a video on game design
just wait for antibirth api tbh
I think Nicalis could benefit from looking at a better, more documented modding API i.e. Minetest
torn between a walkman and a broken pair of earbuds
i'll work on more sprites in the meantime. got an idea for an item that boosts your stats when the floor's music intensifies
I think I'll just hold off on isaac modding.
pfffff
learn assembly and inject a DLL into afterbirth+ to modify the API to allow stat changing
i think its impossible within the API
should only be a matter of time before somebody cracks this davinci code bullshit and makes a tutorial, tho
tell me about it
i  n e e d stat changimg
I love that it's spreading. I song requested Ocean Man in a completely non-related small twitch stream earlier, and three people quickly chimed in with the copypasta
all praise ocean man
Ocean man take us away from this terror.
Ocean man
this is feeling more and more like these modding "tools" by the minute
come to think of it i'd also need to handcraft an axe to finish chopping down the tree in the first place
well i could also position the hammer-needing thing beneath the tree and then let the tree fall on top of it, but that doesn't mean it would be a good idea
somewhat
if it's a pot that can hold molten iron you can probably hammer stuff with the pot
well all these metaphors are more or less functionally identical
exavtly
No it's like you got a hammer from Ikea but you lost the instructions
"a pot of molten iron" because saying "ore" would have broken the metaphor since you could just hammer stuff with the ore
no it was more like you got a hammer but it was very dull and hidden in a dense forest
i was expecting a hammer and i got a pot of molten iron and a half-cut-down tree
i've enjoyed playing it and even like the new final boss despite its lazy design... but these modding tools are, well.
But as soon as I tried doing anything productive I've had nothing but frustration
I got a slight bit of enjoyment when first playing around with modding and starting to make a simple little debug info mod
can't say I've gotten a single bit enjoyment out of this
I got some enjoyment out of my first apollyon run and the april's fool challenge
...and that's not saying much.
Yup
afterbirth+ has better content than it has modding API tbh
isaac Mod DLC my ass.
<@155802905671237633> the thing that cracked me up. The debug symbol filename was apparently E:\Nicalisp4\isaac-ngModDLC
I've almost got a dog entity
actually probably looking up at me from far below. more thematically appropriate.
i'm gonna have nightmares about the sprite i made for the item i wanted to make looming over me and asking me "my god, my god, why have you forsaken me"
dreams don't come true
that was a nice dream
I don't have nightmares but I had a dream that the afterbirth+ api was any good at all
i'll be having nightmares of this docummentation
<@155802905671237633> no debug symbols
oh hey invulnerability
bambnoozled again
0h no
i'm trying to display link
you idiot it is green
L O S T
thats because it isnt green
amazing
xD
that's some WoTL luck down shit right there
look how well I can work with the sprite object https://gfycat.com/DishonestYoungBronco
how does that even...?
and if you have soy-milk level damage, damage downs become damage ups
<@132604813731954688> are there debug symbols or?
so, yeah
if we could mess with stats at all
well there'd be both
to balance it out
make a damage down pill
*actually*
good pill
make a damage up pill
Hell I even looked in the binary to see if there just were some things that didn't get listed in the api.
there we go
"captain's log, twenty-seventeen, oh-one, oh-four. the crew has managed to replicate the effects of an "hp upgrade". however, stat upgrades continue to elude even our most powerful minds."
so either that's not where you set stuff or...
^
cache flag does nothin
And the EntityPlayer has an AddCacheFlags function
GetTearHitParams() seems to give you a new object not reflecting the player's actual stats
the tear params page is iteresting https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_tear_params.html
There's CacheFlag enums for every stat.
seems redundant
Oh it can why do you have the boolean then
In like four hours of banging my head against stats, the closest thing I can come up with is CacheFlags
best guess is GetTearHitParams ()
so what sucks is that you are using a boolean for the logic of the item which seems hacky, why can't the API just natively check for an item being held
Yeah HP upgrades are easy.
nope
still no progress on just adding 5 damage with a passive / trinket though?
yes
we could do that before lol
wow nice 1hp
we got an hp upgrade
its on the image
stop the presses
http://i.imgur.com/OiLVvWz.png
+1hp
yes
can the passive do anything
it was very painful
it has a random chance to shoot any tear type
<@66197463593136128> not too hard http://pastebin.com/aXY6Fpx4
it was not easy
I made a passive that makes enemies drop black hearts when you damage them
op nerf now
have fun making passives that's why
and holy shit it shoots chaos cards
why is it active tho
cool item
https://gfycat.com/MinorWelllitFirefly
because the docs are shit
I know how to do this
I'm saying no one knows enough
you litearlly said that LOL
cooler mods to come tho http://i.imgur.com/OiLVvWz.png
I'm not saying that
it's exaggerating to say no one knows anything
^
we know we can make isaac green
one mod cool
i'm completely 100% lost on rendering sprites (on top of everything) so I can make my own game
Yo that could actually work; get both Cricket's Head and Cricket's Body, and you lose the effects of both but gain a Cricket familiar
oc do not steal my dog
that's not true, ive made a mod
the entire thing
yes I am currently trying to create a dog npc that will bark at enemies and fear them
is there anything we are completely 100% lost on
yes

really tho?
pretty much
is that really true jer
that is also a beautiful dog
only a few people have even managed to make sense of what little API we have
dog familiar?

that IS a nice dog
pupper
thats a beautiful dog
wasn't there somebody in here a little while ago with a screenshot of an item they'd managed to mod into the game
i might take a cat though
!bloat !bloat !bloat !bloat
http://i.imgur.com/5E1cyHm.png
dang
it lets chatters spawn items, pickups, enemies, bosses in my game
no thanks i don't want a dog
good one
i'd gift a dog to someone for a decent API
twitch chat interaction mod? is that the one where you hit the uninstall button after chat says how bad ab+ is?
I'd eat my dog for some decent documentation
I drew a dog
got my twitch chat interaction mod working ?
thank
32x32
item sized usually?
good API ??
Im doing that dog
Hrmmm. Well that bites.
sprite an isaac enemy which is a tyrone which has been burned, stabbed, whipped, decapitated, drawn and quartered, and mauled by a mountain lion
so far anyways
it's impossible
Lets see
it isn't just not simple
giant flying dog
I figured I could just look at what files make up Eden's Blessing and change what I needed to change but, uh, it's looking increasingly likely that it won't be that simple  :P
yeah I should get going on the wine guide huh
Item or enemy
Hey I'm trying to make an item very similar to Eden's Blessing, is there any way to look at its details as an item that correlates in any way with how I need to assemble the new item?
Give me an idea and I will sprite it for isaac
Now....
jer write a guide
runs in WINE
rip linux users ;-;
Fuck the krampus his brimstone lasers had to get an update
Antibirth Lua to the rescue
and it's not unlikely
they probably won't ever be good
the best we can hope for is antibirth lua
they added another attack to KRAMPUS OF ALL THINGS
it's depressing that the best we can hope for is that the modding tools are "ok" in a year
yeah
if nicalis never added a third attack to forsaken then they're probably never going to fix the mod tools
hopefuly
In a year
But the modding tools will be ok
AB+ WILL STILL SUCK
nicalis' probably won't
Antibirth will have more cool content
and modding tools will be good in a year
Ecks Dee
Rocks see
have fun
good luck trying to have fun
Go to antibirth
Im just going to beat greedier mode with az
Now
Lemon
that had documentation
ok
that was fun
^
I'd way rather be lua modding gmod right now
just wait for antibirth api tbh
don't hold your breath for it to get good!
Til I start this
I might try making my own docs if I can stop getting distracted by Gmod.
it's bad
Im just gonna wait a month
this is just a glorified enumerator list
that's what we're dealing with
Kk Im getting it
it's like a dictionary which only lists the words and doesn't define them
ye
it's just a list
from pills to items
they're not there
and maybe examples
those things are supposed to have descriptions
Yeah I know
you'll see a shitload of things listed
bob click on anything in the giant lists you can get expanded from the bar on the left side
I think
There already is one
I get it a bit
someone is making an intro to lua tutorial, you might be able to start with that
I love how the docs document the bugs that the console has instead of just having Nicalis fix them
I know that
i only say that because its not in a very good state right now
this is probably not the place to start
you know what I love
I do not know the first thing about coding
bob do you have any programming experience
welcome to the club
but kind of not
im kind of getting this
Ok
it's easy I swear
read the docs and tell us how to make a mod
wat
literall this is only hurting them, they don't gain anything from releasing it when it's not done
read the """"""""docs"""""""" for yourself Bob http://moddingofisaac.com/docs/index.html
I mean given last time I am kind of expecting that most of it will be there in two weeks but, why make us wait two weeks when it was supposed to launch this week
we just have to wait 109 hours guys
because this is the only way nicalis know how to release expansions, apparently
happening
woops I forgot people might need to use functions other than the ones I wanted to use
this
is
why
im scared
????
"we commented out 20% of the API's items by mistake"
had a year and he rushed this complete farce out the door
tyrone's like a schoolkid that put off his summer report until the weekend before it was due
okay good, I misinterpreted that
yeah come on tyrone
I wasn't saying "it's fine, because they're not finsihed"
I was saying, in response to "are they good?" "they're not finished"
But now im having second thoughts
don't say this tyrone
it's been in development for a year tyrone
well true
this was their main selling point
"The Antibirth+ API is just getting started, so to speak" - Tyrone
that wasn't an excuse, it was a description
I was thinking about trying
like a third of the things you need seem to be absent, and almost 100% of the docs
not finished? not an excuse
ok...
sure seems that way
they're not finished
take a guess
Are the modding tools trash?
so
I've had no issues with kilburn's docs
kilburn's documentation is about as barren notes but it's clear, concise, and searchable
if not we are gettin our money back
^
just gotta hope they decide to add the rest of the api before the end of the week
travoos that took me about 90 seconds to script
but nope we're stranded in the desert
I got Brainsplosion after that code block
if there was just decent documentation we could still fuck around and do cool things even without several of the most obvious and powerful features we would all prefer to have
I remember how easy it looked to make a mod where you shoot black hearts that deal damage to enemies
so you'll be able to carry the knowledge over to Antibirth when the time comes
it's sublime yes
this might be THE KEY TO THE KINGDOM
gotta agree with Limt here, although the syntax is sort of similar to kilburn's API (but more horrid)
is that sublime?
it will be a wonder to even add an item completly into the game
https://files.catbox.moe/vhu0vc.png
as bad as the API is yeah
sure
show us the code
well turns out this is a fucking awful way to learn lol
?
i'm literally new to the modding scene, i know nothing but antibirth and ab+ so anything i do is in lua using the api given and i'll probably make stuff that already exists weh
thanks, nicalis
I mean Yeah this thing really did teach me what the Special and Type Hook do, great documentation, den out of den, I would recommend this to my friends
is that directly in Lua or via anm2?
<@135254843567767552> yeah it's a mod already, I assumed you were trying to port it lol
they're really sticking it to us dataminers for trying to data mine the api
they are arguably the most important part of making a mod but what they do is for you to discover
what if you had to beat the april fools challenge to unlock the real ab+ and real api and documentation
my favourite part is LUA
my favorite part are the callbacks
I don't get if ab+ is supposed to be a parody of nicalis or what
it actually has labels and they just become more and more sparse until they disappear completely
my favorite part is the entity enum
^
how tho
I also expected very sparse documentation, but not literally a list of shit with no descriptions
was that an existing mod already? i'm just messing about trying to figure out what everything does and found a way to colour the brimstone, nothing else
the API itself is generally about as mediocre as I expected, but the two big surprises are no input hooks and no stat changes (visibly)
I want that
to make isaac play an animation you just call a string that is the name of that animation, but I can't see that function on EntityNPC
Prismstone, YES
oh prismstone
a backport is more likely
https://files.catbox.moe/fxznlv.gif
the API is worse than any of us had ever thought, there's no way it supports even ten percent of Antibirth
video isn't relevant, post in <#207259602969034753>
I dont think the Devs of AntiB want to even work with a doc worth of nothing
I mean the rumors of that are totally out of hand at least
how do you play animations for npcs, like if I have a npc that uses a anm2 file, how do I set it to the animation I made?
ab+ is coming to Antibirth
lol no
no
so not ab+
I think antibirth is actually coming over to AB+
anyone can play whatever they have the stomach to play
i guess melon
I personally can only see a temporary split as if ab+ gets backported to Antibirth there will be no reason to use the official ab+
Pooping monstro recolors are more than enough for reddit crowd it seems.
there's no reason for a community split, it's not like you have to lock yourself out of one or the other
tbh i wouldnt mind, antibirth is amazing and afterbirth (and plus for that matter) are not even good expansions
he's a pacifist
it's barebones but sadly it's almost as powerful as ab+'s
maybe it means he can't attack you but hey, you can't attack him either
is a community split forseeable?
whenever monstro lands from his jump he surrounds himself with a ring of red poops
and yes maysick they are and have been for a while
thats too hc dude
woow
monstro can spawn RED POOPS
so, antibirth devs are making their own api?
do they really think ppl want to make actives and monsters pooping all around
okay guys new mod
otherwise no
they're pretty useful if you want to make pooping monstro
at all
which dont help
then they would have known if it was good enough for anyone else :P
but instead they made only 2
mhm
if they actually had to use the api
They would show how you can make a whole thing with not a single original asset ??
yes
that's how it should have worked
at least
it ensures the api is better documented, more feature rich and has more examples
there should have been like 20 example mods spanning across all different types of functionality
I saw this coming from miles away
yea i think thats actually an interesting idea
thing is they didn't show anything because there was nothing to show
Its mostly code anyway
Hey doing the whole DLC in Lua would have worked
#SaltGalore
the blog post ones don't work without tweaking
they should have put at least 1 of each thing inside of it instead of a pooping monstro and a head that doesnt even have animation and is just isaacs head with a flame
i got the ones from their blog post
hey limt see if you can port the chain tears example that is in the antibirth api
the whole game though? noooo :p
you must have ran someone's fixed version
anyone found an easy way to spawn a "random enemy"? i'll probably end up just going through the entity enum and writing down relevant numbers
the new shit should definitely have been written with the new tools and available as working examples
they worked for me lol
EXAMPLES OF BROKEN MODS WHICH WON'T RUN
they didn't even work lol
tbh their "EXAMPLE MODS" aint helping
and yet love2d exists
yeah I agree they should have made all the new items, character, greedier mode, all in lua
I alrdy know one that is completly in Lua
.-.
You wouldn't want to make a game in Lua
that isnt how lua works
"the source code in lua" is meaningless
so, recode the entire game?
thats why I said "the source code **in lua**"
with how long it took them they could have remade almost the whole game in lua by now
but "source code in lua" doesnt make any sense :P
they should have made the new items in lua and put them in as examples, and that would have shown them how much it wasn't adequate
I know
because the source code isn't in lua
right now they look hardcoded
why couldnt they give us the source code in lua instead of this """""""""""""""""""""Documentation"""""""""""""""""""""
I don't even want to make actual mods in this hunk of cum api, I just want to experiment with enemy code so I have a better idea how I'll do it later in Kilburn's real lua api
can you even make new heart types
> implying implications
nah
calm down
no one has implied that
<:LUL:229765547787550720>
>Implying this """""""api""""""" has any redeeming qualities that don't require hacky workarounds
been doing it all day
```LUA
local function salt()
salt = salt + 20
end```
I saw that but it's bizarre that that's the best option
but alternatively, you can install bash shell and just do it like you would on linux
http://i.imgur.com/OiLVvWz.png
Someone posted a python script on the forums
ye
is there a way to view error logs in real time on windows?
renders white text every time
```Lua
local mod = RegisterMod("Annoying Text", 1)

local function render()
    Isaac.RenderText("I'm over here!", 42, 19, math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), 255)
end

mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, render)
```
if anybody can contact doomspeaker about making a custom namespace for modding pages in the wiki (if its even possible for him to do so) pls tell him thx
I'm trying to make text render in a different color
we do need a central place to put snippets of code that other people have already worked out though
maybe but I don't know what the hell it wants
for the past 8 hours
Im trying to add a costume
man this sucks
that one's doable
I spent half an hour trying to figure out how to check if the player is holding a specific trinket and gave up
green isaac dont care about stats
"those are vital to gameplay? nah"
"nobody would want to make a boring old stat up"
i mean
#SlothModeConfirmed
plain old forgot
they probably just forgot to put the stat ups in
May as well try though
and making void just random existing rooms is pure lazyness
I'm trying so damn hard to figure out the stat ups.
Can confirm, no idea what I'm doing
tyrone ethnically cleansed the bosses
recums
Tyrone was busy making reskins and rewhites for the delirium
you want stat ups? ? you want user input hooks? ? you want to have a single fucking clue what you're doing? ? ? ?
indeed
this is just a list of functions
i guess tyrone was too busy spriting recolors for delirium
also yeah calling this a documentation is like calling a commodore 64 a supercomputer
not enough money for further documentation?
how do they fuck up something as simple as basic API features
though im not sure how we can get a search thats narrowed down to only the modding shit
there aren't enough quotes in the world to call this """""documentation"""""
a decent amount of it is self explanatory but things like missing callback workarounds could use some help
yea gamepedia is easy to edit its like editing wikipedia
we are getting brain exhaustion from this "documentation"
if it's easy to edit then i can help
ok
pls
do it
whats ur guys' opinion on this
im thinking about starting one as a subsection of the rebirth gamepedia
what docs?
so it looks like nobodys working on a wiki that further expounds upon the lua docs
what id would my costume even have :/
hmm
so if I understand this correctly, this would work...
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_config_1_1_item.html
how would I even do that mr KyoZM
w
Fuffles, did you list the costume wiht the item on items.xml?
and apparently I got a Battery from the Freezer Baby, throwing rocks really works!
I really would want the Costume thing to work
I really want to get the Damage Up to work
Salt Galore, defo yes
ofc not
lets see if there is any other Costume adding thinggy available in the EntityPlayer Thinggy
<@97356230934138880> bites you can do Game().GetRoom().IsAmbushDone() to check it the room is cleared
I wonder what this is EntityPtr
even tho its the only thing I want atm
Okay, I wont be that salty
<:isaac_cute:231218432148766720>
nope i wish
is there a callback for clearing a room
Alrighty.
okay its harder than impossible imo
no
better than nothing
Is there one?
What's the callback for picking up a passive item?
back to the impossible modding topic then?
let's not
back to the salty topic
bad thing
*throws a rock at <@!216324079504982016>*
cause AB+ is trash rn?
ok
why should I gun myself
okay seriously
I just dig into the files
haven't seen that
rly?
hey <@146600389779783680> how do you find documentation for xmls, like the ones for familiars and items?
I think I am gonna update my audio mods real quick on the moddingofisaac site to allow for AB+ support since I do plan on using AB+ more often
I can only say one, I never was so salty in such a short period of time
How did it come to this
because they want to use the content they added in the previous one
like most games that release dlcs also require the previous dlc for you to play the new one unless its just hats or something
But why is dlc within dlcs a normal thing
and greedy asf
i mean I know its funny meme time but you're talking about a pretty normal thing :v
DLCtastic
dlc for dlc isnt uncommon
Dlception
mhm
It's a dlc of a dlc
mhm
But we just bought a DLC that requires **ANOTHER DLC TO BUY IT**
So if I heard this correctly: somebody found a mod to re-enable achievements for AB+?
how lovely
according to them its everything you need to know about making a new bomb type
We get done complaining how much we hate dlcs to triple a companies
dw documentation tells you if GetPlayerAttack is bool or integer
if you really want the "documentation" here it is
Guys
I mean
*for the first 8 months
monthly
for a small price of 99.99
that's disheartening
I need to speed up my reactions
oh.
That's booster pack 3
savage
wow
There is none
Not there
Perhaps i'm dumb, but where even is the documentation you guys keep mentioning?
(Per dlc)
(Per save file)
*Restore your saved data for $6.66*
**APRIL FOOLS! We deleted all your saved data!**
no loss
*insert 1 trollface*
April Fools, we removed the Documentation
wrong
April Booster Pack - ARG Starter Kit
I think people who refund it this week will regret it when they then have to buy it back later for a more expensive price, but it's their money
beeing 3% complete
can someone tell me how to add a xml for custom npcs
March Booster Pack - The documentation for said modding tools
thats more like it
1% of the modding tools
nah
dang you must be impatient af
February Booster Pack (Pack #1) - The rest of the modding tools
i refunded it
no?
lets hope the mods do great
lets face it in we're all gonna be playing it non-stop until we 100% it again
Just like no man's sky
And content updates will attempt to save it
I wanted to make it a card but...
I wonder how much will get added in Feb, Im so excited to see 1 item get added to the game, yeeeeee
AB+ is No Man's Sky, it got overhyped af
is there a screenHeight and screenWidth variable?
AB+ is No Man's Sky guys, just wait for a patch to come out in 3 months and the game will get better.
Ooh, great idea!
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834936082
apperently familiars have no movement commands
why are pc controllers so expensive
jesus fucking christ i hate logitech controllers
so how do I do a custom npc xml
Im up for that
remind me how many people successfully sued nicalis last time
are we doing the sue nicalis meme again
IT WORKS BUT IT KEEPS GOING TO SAME POSITION
The No man's sky of 2017
AB+ has a rly bad start so far
lol
AYYYYYYYYYYYY
AB+
False advertising
yes
*lack of documentation
**Sue Nicalis**
So
And you can't do these things due to improper documentation
this fits the topic even!
a-greed
oh wait
agreed
yes
Please change this channel name to #nicalis_hate_club
You were advertised modding api capable of doing these things
That's when we sue
so
and we werent
by that logic we should have all been charged an extra buck last night
*HAH*
they will litteraly ask for extra 1$ for access to an updated doc
the period was just the first thing i caught
the error you got was for addCallback not being AddCallback
they will if u ask for one
removing the period with a colon didnt fix anything
they wont do a newer doc
Maybe set a main menu ui sprite for the custom char?
the devs got their money
AND I'm really sad about the lack of content generators
pff
In the char xml thing
We'll probably have to wait a few months for either fan-made documentation or actual documentation from the devs.
but at least his Boss Stuff works
he'S invisible
It's something
I mean I have a Void Char so far
Pretty much impossible
I'm sure it's possible, but hey... no documentation to know how to do so
That's robo bb
it kinda is
And it's impossible to make a new character
Oh and, errors when launching the room editor lol
also <@132192021984051201> they are case sensitive, so AddCallback
their Room Editor Crashes on me
Can we also point out we were advertised that you can make infinite Isaac's with the api
tbh
But it just looks awful
there's no way to even specify a collectible type to put a specific item in a room
ohhh
I know Basement Renovator got more work put into it
yeah lol
Also, can we mention that their room editor is kinda really bad compared to Basement Renovator
you used a period <@132192021984051201>
or like, literally anything that isnt rehashed content
Void needed dark room overlay with custom rocks
https://i.gyazo.com/b9084f0fe2e2035225ca057c6a132b95.png got:   ERR: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/losermod/main.lua:28: attempt to call a nil value (method 'addCallback')
I wonder WHY They gave the community the remote to add stuff now, hmm maybe their LACK OF CREATIVITY
it could have been animated or something and visually similar to apollyon's active
well it would be white if it had its own tiles :P
well not white
tbh I think the void being made of mixed up rooms is good
what it needed was a custom glitch overlay, not some shitty white tileset
hmm
I might be wrong though ?
Nicalis really just doesn't seem all that creative, from what I can tell
a big missed opportunity was a custom tileset for the void that simply pulled the room layouts
They are so Lazy, I predict Sloth mode as the next mode
everything else was bot generated
explaining how to enable the console
they wrote the front page
They wrote themselves, 1 page
no prob Tuturu
Yes, that is why I said 1 page
Sorry everyone. I did a bad. ?
they litteraly used a bot for it
whoops
just realized I am on <#205854782542315520>, not <#264851654627688450>
They didnt even write
It's pathetic
tbh I think ed will patch some of the most egregious bullshit things and the reviews will gradually climb to decent again
we just have to hope they get the mod support and docs working properly though
ohwait a second
They wrote 1, and I mean ONE page of documentation
wat

so it definitely enhanced my disappointment, but this level of documentation isn't really acceptable
Tbh most ppl bought AB+ for the possibility of ez mod making anyway, but they got surprised by a documentation of nothing
honestly i was already hype to make mods, antibirth gave me some even cooler ideas and now i feel like i can't make them
Have you guys checked the page recently for AB+?
I feel like it'll probably drop down to whatever is after that
Wait a second
AB+ has 1,107 Positive reviews and 762 Negative reviews, sitting at a "Mixed" rating
The documentation would still be an awful issue
People wouldn't be as nitpicky about the amount of content
I think people would still be upset but less so
on account of no fucking documentation
probably still pretty bad
Would it still be considered "bad"
yeah it was pretty unlucky timing on their part
I really wonder how this would've all played out if Antibirth didn't exist
I am just saying the way they are handling AB+ is kinda meh.
So yeah, now I know why they picked GREED out of all the Sins available
it does require them to be purchased together now, because now they are only available in a bundle
Steam doesn't have much support for dlc for dlc apparently :v
I get that
after that its 10 Bucks for every Afterbirth player too
ah ok
so someone could buy ab+ and not have ab and then try to run it and be sol
the offer is only till 10th jan
^
no they didnt
iirc the steam store page doesn't actually prevent you from buying it if you don't own afterbirth
wait
That's what they did Green Tuturu
But buying AB+ alone makes it 10 bucks but comes with AB
*confused*
why can't we make the refillbar with maxcharges="110" ?!?
for example: if you had already purchased Afterbirth, maybe it could make AB+ 33 or 66% off permanently since you already had AB
So not a seperate DLC?
tbh I think the way they should have handled it is that buying AB+ would be the 10 bucks they ask for if it already came with afterbirth
sigh
remember cave story 3d lol
nicalis in general isn't a great company though
Seriously I would sell puppies to michael vic for some comments on the lua reference guide.
tbh I don't object to people charging for ports, that work doesn't get done for free and usually the license to post games on someone else's console isn't free either
just play the "Money, Money, Money!!!!!!!11!!" clips alrdy
wish i knew how to get GetTearHitParams () to work, TOO BAD THEY DONT HAVE A DESCRIPTION
I just find Nicalis to be mega scummy imo
And a short (but good) one too
.-.
Also a freeware game
They also sold Ikachan for $5 lol
i'm not super against them charging for the mod tools but they DID have the option to make them free
my simple mod is done
Some more stuff
instead they decided 'fuck it lets add some more stuff in'
if they were greedy they'd make the mod tools only and ask 6 bucks for it
That screams greedy to me
10$ for litteraly a tiny expansion
Selling Cave Story original on the Wii for money
I mean
imo they are rly greedy
aaAah
mhm
don't fight me
!! ^ this is an opinion btw
Nicalis is a lame company anyway
Nicalis is like their Greedier mode
it was supposed to come out last summer but got delayed for half a year for... some reason
Cool
Like, couldnt it just be 3 dollars and be done with it
Nicalis, remaking Cave Story for the 3rd time
work on other projects? its called Nicalis, not the ISaac team
My main issue is if its just an expansion to afterbirth, why is it so expencive?
they had a year to make a dlc
suck nl's dick
we have a lot of furries in this chat
what did they do for the whole year?
they should give us 50% of what we payed back for that documentation
I mean most people in this *channel* bought it to make mods, I don't think most people did :P
tell them so they can fix it then
they had a year to make proper documentation
and their "documentation" is so bad
f -
most ppl bought it because they wanted to make mods
i think its shit because the modding documentation is ass
they said they were making a +
no
and its a +
people think its shit because they came in expecting something antibirth-levels of big
and lots of money for it
ezpz
shit name, shit dlc
I wouldnt call that giant white thing a nothing
basically
"Afterbirth and a bit more"?
no huge features?
its not a full on expansion theres no huge features, it's literally afterbirth +
it's called afterbirth+ because its literally a +
*cough cough* Afterbirth- confirmed *cough cough*
i still cant believe thats what they ended up going with
Afterbirth+ .-. is there any **worse** names for another DLC
trick'd by the lua makers
aside from the "promise" of eventual extensive mods, the console is the most interesting thing to come out of this $10
fuck
tbh with how they worked so far they rly just went greedon
<@!194259969359478784> lua arrays start at 1
its not content, its just extra commands
they can update
they cant just add content for 0$
so hey does anyone know how to find which entity is closest to isaac?
I swear to god that those mini updates will cost something xP
mhm
there's a few items i've seen on the workshop and stuff with some pretty basic functionality but somehow nicalis didn't imagine any of use would want to play a fucking sound
unless the reason we cant make passives is because they literally didnt put in a callback in it
with their "documentation"
okay maybe max a year
max a month
min 1 week till items are makeable
i like afterbirth+ but they could be more explanatory with this documentation
nope sorry liliy, we still have problems with a simple item
main.lua:22: attempt to index a nil value (field '?')
just doesn't print any entities[i].Type
lua isn't bad lol
i have been trying all day to make a sound play, anyone have any success on that yet?
Lua is knife, knife is bad
it detects when i use the item
i have the callback yes
Because it's lua
why not !=
ugh we need to figure out a way to mess with stats
Epicbob, did you define it as a function?
hold on*
okay cold on
http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/x3vh5w.png
```Lua
mod:use_item()
    cWrite("Use item")
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 0, #entities do
        cWrite(entities[i].Type)
    end
end
```
doesn't work
Im alrdy confused that += and -= dont exist in lua
>= is fine in lua
idk if lua even has that
is '>=' the issue??
is '>=
but it might solve dem problems
ok
neither do I
i don't get it
what
proceed with caution
<@!194259969359478784> dark magic in here
not at all needed lol
optional
mhm
; in lua?!
thanks
I think you need a ; after that bobster
MC_POST_UPDATE then test for trinket
It just hit me
OH
what callback or whatever do I use to run something while a player holds a trinket?
elseif is correct for lua
ye
what do you mean
the error is elseif if I read the error rite
?
if I read dem error correctos
is it >=?
you need to write more behind entities[i].Type I think
`        cWrite(entities[i].Type)`
https://i.gyazo.com/5eade009159a8a5311f276b85b7400b0.png
Great to hear :>
Ah, thanks a ton guys. It worked! The blood effects I created look sick.
dudes, instead of typing the error alone, please include the freaking error line TnT
Posting your code is helpful
/main.lua:22: function arguments expected near ')'
nah its elseif
ifelse?
AAA DOTS AND COLONS RUN!
it's an attribute so Entity.Type
ERR: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/losermod/main.lua:22: syntax error near 'elseif
how do we use 
Entity:Type 
Entity:Type() 
Entity.Type 
Entity.Type()
but for now its just a fancey decor in my item list
I wish you worked by now
Oh., wow
everyone's 1st mistake
haha
my first mistake
Ah, okay okay TY
32 bits
<@108221250249220096> save as 32 bit sprite
i mean it fits
Guys, I need a little bit of help. I made a bunch of custom spirtes that all work but for whatever reason, the blood effects have a red box around them. How fix?
who tjouht --[[ was a ggreat way to make a comment
okay my grammatic drops to -1 when Im tired
Reluaper
They get compiled away I'm pretty sure
I need Resharper
lua isn't that hard it just has a weird syntax you have to get used to
Is it interchangable? Or do they just get compiled away? Cause that's how JS handles them.
in Lua you need to use your brain to ever get something to work
no
in C# you put ; after every line
yea but its not as easy as in C#
sometimes it dont work
my mod was messing up for a while until I realised that you had to type the word "and" instead of &&
It's interchangeable with a new line
its weird
You can use ; in LUA afaik
nice
you forgot the ;
{} () [] ? ;
lua's called lua because every time you try to explain it to a C# user they say 'Lu-whaaaaa???'
Im just not used to no brackets at all
y
+ for math
~~and LUA makers were lazy asf~~
.. for strings
lua is just super weird overall lol
thats why its combined, to avoid errors
it would rather thing
The Luaish translation to C# of "Else if"
else (if)
if javascript is the pepsi of programming, lua is the weird creamy soda from Spain that your cousin bought on his trip there
I cant think
<@!226519543588192256> https://github.com/Creysys/SubscriberBabies
no wait ugh
we should figure this out and make a series 'Lua Tutorials for C# Users'
so it would litteraly think "if (else)"
its confusing as hell
a sane person in c# uses brackets to lock the thing they want to test for
a insane person in lua must combine the 2 words to elseif because lua doesnt use brackets
I was surprised that LUA is so lightweight it doesn't even include +=, -=, etc... operators
<@105465854551937024> have you seen GetTearHitParams()?
yup
https://i.gyazo.com/7a64ccdcda7a9d19f9e74c7954deeb50.png like this????????
I acctually know why they did it
not after each conditional
and you only put one end at the end of the entire conditional block
yes
yea
yes
yes
wait, elseif is just one word?????????
not "else if"
"elseif"
ah
Twitch mod?
No, it's elseif
LUA's fucking with my brain
Else if is ez to understand
Probably don't need that "end" before the else if?
where what
I understand elif
Lua is weird
elseif
<@105465854551937024> where?
<@146600389779783680> I looked this up earlier. Dot is used for static functions. Colon is used for member functions. Calling a function passes an implicit "this" parameter to the function call so you can access and modify the object.
https://i.gyazo.com/dc257d313c91a9cfb7943c4ea43e33fc.png
line 13 RicePrezPip?
You need to end the else statement
That's selse explainatory
ERR: ...ames/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/losermod/main.lua:17: 'end' expected (to close 'function' at line 13) near 'else'
and it uses vanilla stuff and not modded stuff .-.
And someone made a Twitch mod
no wait acctually I think I understand this garbage thing now
I saw sockets.lua or whatever
Yeah they already have them included I think
You can use a library for HTTP, right?
It's sad that it would probably be easier for me to just do an HTTP request to get item info from the wiki or something
because I need to figure Costumes out
UGh I rly want to understand this garbage undefined thing
```     AddCostume (Config::Item Item, boolean ItemStateOnly)```
table:method() just passes self as the first argument. equivalent of table.method(table) iirc
.
xd
oceanMan:takeMeByTheHand
I think you'll like my second mod
Prophets of War
Last.fm...
i wish
Ocean Man?
in a row
lmao according to my last.fm i've listened to the same song 30 time already
Colon is for public member functions
fields also use period
#MadeWithUnity
but the callbacks use .
C# ftw
C# ?
Never used LUA but from observations, it seems like the period is for static methods
so did me
i came from C# this is so confusing
the same with ; and nothing
^
when do i use . and when do i use :
Use colon
myMod:render()
https://i.gyazo.com/fa8e14e65db31429734531cb0232a551.png so im calling render correctly?
WEAPON_TEARS
weapon typ can be
yea
alot of args tho
math.random usually works better than Random()
TearParams EntityPlayer::GetTearHitParams    (    WeaponType     WeaponType,
float     DamageScale,
integer     TearDisplacement 
)
Function(argument)  <@132192021984051201>, not sure what you're looking for, just calling a function
xD
seems like so
because it seems like it to me
not sure yet
try Random()
so basically params set the Tears Behavior?
same
how is the Random Number generator from the RNG class seeded? I get the same numbers every time regardless of it being an entirely new issac process
also does anyone know the syntax for calling functions? all google gives me is confusing math stuff
thank u
params:TearDamage = 20
oh that will get in handy with my current item
```Color     TearColor```
<@132192021984051201> Use the console command "luamod [nameofyourmod]" to reload your script and bypass the stupid old thing
local params = player:GetTearHitParams()
something like
can you crack the Vault tho boi
ok..?
THE KINGDOM IS OURS BOIS
it just makes no sense to me tbh
but how they wrote it
the key to tear effects
that thing really is the key
O
how do i tell the game to fuck off and stop marking my mods as old
the KEY
>https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_tear_params.html
I think I have a fix, bite I'm on mobile
idk what Parameters in general are tbh
I only have 1, and it doesn't even work
Get the Hit Parameters?
but dont we forget + modded items
what will GetTearHitParams() do?
close enough
510
doesnt isaac have like 500 items?
dem code be like If If If If If If If If If If If If If If If If
1 for every item
lol
Long
Do a kind series of ifs :P
but I can't get to that damn function
and there's a function in Config that takes the ID and returns an Item instance with all the properties
but well Im rly confused about the thing in general
I can get the item ID
I was just making a test mod that displays the item name on an item pedestal
soo shouldnt it be just what you named it
The name is in the xmls, no?
I assume it's populated from the XMLs yeah
i.e. its name
Does :render just run every frame?
isn't config the XML stuff you make?
I wanna get the metadata associated with an item
Can't figure out how to access the Config namespace
I've been trying to figure that out since yesterday
but how do I use this ancient language, hmm
Good luck getting that Item instance
hmm this is something, I think
 ```AddCostume (Config::Item Item, boolean ItemStateOnly)```
time to read the garbage they generated and try to add mah costume stuffs
Well
hmm I broke my Debug_Texter :/
It'll still work because it caps it at 1
RenderText uses floats from 0.0 to 1.0 for RGBA, not integers 0 to 255
maybe
aside from that it shpuld work?
ah, i gotta put ==
I love to see single "=" mistakes in If's
"else if loser ***=*** true and..."
I see 1
see any logic errors?
looks nice I guess
Coords on the window or the level? I've been thinking about using an API from something else to write info to the screen.
https://i.gyazo.com/549421b2119962963d25cd85118309c7.png what do u guys think?
so idk what there is to investigate
it pretty much spawns a text on coords with a color
I'm on mobile and trying to investigate some stuff
ohhhh i dont know why i didnt think of that
Does someone have a vid of an example of RenderText?
<@132192021984051201> +1 to the counter each frame I believe
Can anyone help me with my RoomEditor situation? i cant open it correctly since it cant find entites2.xml and when i look for it, i dont have it
does anyone know how the frame counter works
?
<@198846198122151937> RN I think we can't
what is that anyway?
i belive you've found the keys to the kingodm
bob
It does render SOME colors that are valid RGB colors. Others are just white
yah that's what I'm wondering, how do you change the parameters of tears you spawn?
That very well could be
<@87033084934893568> Pretty sure the RGB are 0-1, not 0-255. Could that be your issue?
parameters is what it could be
no idea tbh
uh
figured out yet?
what is this
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_tear_params.html
i cant appear to open the RoomsEditor correctly since i am missing entities2.xml?
Issac.GetFrameCount IIRC
why wouldn't it
So I've been playing with Isaac.RenderText for a while now. It appears that it refuses to render certain colors of text.
whats the syntax for frame count?
It bothers me that there aren't any, even though it is easier. Just getting out of habits, I guess
Bye
Ok reim actually going now
idk tbh
uhh
wait... will player:AddCacheFlags(CACHE_DAMAGE ) do anything?
You can still use semicolons
I only hate python for personal reasons
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/class_config_1_1_config.html
To figure out formatting and the like. Since, y'know, WE WERE GIVEN NOTHING. OK, I'm done now
So has anyone figured out how to access the Config class?
no semicolons **really** bothers me
Resource Extractor not working :P
https://i.gyazo.com/91473963cf35c88c0925c91d86f28042.png would this work?
its API is so different from every other language i know that i never liked it
And then messing with it and call it your own
Most of the time you will be copying and pasting crap
<@!202997568886538241> Can i ask why? ;D
you need to jump into the resources folder gfx and find a familiar anim
about that
but forgiving
slow
but wait if I'm making a custom familiar how do I add animation?
Python is forgiving
LMAO
nice job
i hate python
so pretty much that code up there just makes an item remove its effect when restarted?
Python scrub
I love it
Lua is so close to Python
omg ty so much
makes sense
<@198846198122151937> ```XML
<familiar description="Double shot buddy" gfx="Collectibles_167_HarlequinBaby.png" id="167" name="Harlequin Baby" />```
http://pastebin.com/aXY6Fpx4
have some beautiful code, my people
Rice there should be a built in one!!!¡
there is true
+= 1 each frame
ive been using RNG()
a variable that
I think it's in the isaac
how do i count frames?
isn't it math.random?
There's a built in frame counter
the position also isnt randomized like i'd hoped
and when the reached amount of frames is achieved make the variable False
There was a wait() in roblox
<@132192021984051201> you would have to do it the callback each frame, and when you take damage... make a variable that Turns True and starts counting frames
I think I saw it somewhere
Anyone know how to do a wait() sorta thing in Lua?
I copied an existing one
uhh
now I'm trying to make a familiar, but I don't know how to add it in a xml
I want to make a item for my irl friend and it uses tears
unless I skip that and go to other stuff I has to do
Me too
Nyanuan pong pong
I need to learn how to add tear effects soonish
Woah!!
haha thats cool
wow thats neato Lunassy
ugh, I think I will modify the ItemPool now
Use like a timer or wait
hey guys check out what I made https://gfycat.com/MinorWelllitFirefly
how do i get it to last longer
wh
its the frame that takes the damage
like it should
Oh
a frame
Like how short is it
Would that be a good thing
it works but the text only appears for a short time
I speak in emoji
?????????
I'm on my phone ???????????
again
hi dud
Shhh
should work
I'm still here
THIS
Shhh
<@132192021984051201> myMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, myMod.render, ENTITY_PLAYER);
SO the params should be OnDamage, Run Function, Player Entity
what's the function to return an entity's position?
watAreWeDoingAnymore()
C# is If if if if if if
LUA is end end end end end
beans()
yes()
theCasingDoesThough()
theNameDoesntMatter()
but well
goshHeckingDarnIt()
itsCalledCamelCasingYouDingus()
camelCase
LUA people should learnToUseCapsRight();
this is rly messy imo
function, end end end end end end
that
try
yes
Lua is rly messy imo
oh i do?
me2 dude
he needs to switch the last 2 params
me neither im used to C#
no
idk how to lua
well this should work now
i'm just lurking here just looking at this cool code
freezer baby is weird
Freezer baby likes to react to my Main.rand.Next( comment ) stuff
https://i.gyazo.com/283c670873e367f7d21867b841bd6be1.png
I mean you should look it up
Is there any good way to tell whether a damage_dealer was a ludovico tear?
probably
so its only for variableS?
```LUA
fuffles:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, fuffles.prism_effect, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER );```
like this
for some lines it is
no
so ; isnt end of line?
oh
but in a different way
Lua uses these
```LUA
Isaac.RenderText(debug_text, 100, 100, 255, 0, 0, 255)```
does... lua not use those?
I have this and it works
_what_
Remove the ; on the end
string, posX, posY, R,G,B,A
I see your mistake
I don't know how to code.
1 sec
or wait
I think there is 1 more argument than it needs
lmao
im making a mod that causes 'You're a loser' to show up every time you take damage
uhh
Isaac.RenderText("You're a loser.", pos.X, pos.Y, 255, 255, 255, 1);
show me line 7 on main.lua
does that not apply an item to isaac rather than spawn one on the floor?
and that error
I think GiveItem should work
uhh
```XML
<trinket description="Am A Zone" gfx="trinket_dashbutton.png" name="Dash Button" />```
ideas?
i keep getting ERR: resources/scripts/main.lua:7: bad argument #4 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got function)
[
what function do I use to spawn a trinket
```Lua
local DashButton_trinket = Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName( "Dash Button" )```
```Lua
function Xitems:DashButton_update()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if player:HasTrinket(Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName( "Dash Button" )) then        
        if player:GetNumKeys() == 0 and player:GetNumCoins() >= 5 then
            player:AddCoins(-5)
            player:AddKeys(1)
        end
        if player:GetNumBombs() == 0 and player:GetNumCoins() >= 5 then
            player:AddCoins(-5)
            player:AddBombs(1)
        end
    end
end```
thats their code in main
but its so bad that I will not give you the sprite pain they gave my eyes
there is a mod on workshop with a trinket
Trinkets?
of any kind
or pocketitem
or card
why should I add another pill, there are like billions of those
rly?!
dont plan on it yet
not yet
has anyone added a new pill / card
you shall be remembered
rest in pizza
*gets stomped with mom leg
kk
my mums pissed

HAHAHA
IM NOT PAYING
:o
:3
I alrdy did dud
if i pay you 10$ will you accept my friend request
Step 8. Pay me 10$
WERGHUIQWEFHUIQWREFU
THE ID
OHHH
OH
oh
Step 1. Go to your Isaac Resources Folder
Step 2. Search for Players.xml
Step 3. copy that
Step 4. paste into your content folder
Step 5. Remove everything but 1 char stuffs
Step 6. Remove the ID part
Step 7. Profit from the invisible Char
ok ill be as careful as i can
okay step by step time
add a player.xml
hmm...
just add a char?
plz you have the keys
whats the code to add a character
woah!!!!!
Its so good that it sends the page and the drawings around to the 5th dimension
can you show your character in the selection wheel?
?
Hush is Blu Baby 2.0 confirmed
fuffles!!!
wait
Hush is asphycsiated child still in the womb confirmed
~~Hush is brain cancer confirmed~~
ok
*conspiracy of the day*
PSA - The Hush area is called the Blue Womb in the gfx files, but called the Dead Womb in sfx and music files

mine'S sprite is so good that its 4d
btw heres my hat in the 3rd dimention o.o
my guy is so powerful, it crashes the game
I rly should give Uzziah a sprite someday
the real ghost
spoopy
Mister Invisible
what?
hmm
you can reset them
so when you detect a new run
I guess
oh ok
when you reset a run all the variables stay the same
Im blind
I see nothing tbh
my key!!!
the insides are fine with 1x1
the keys
http://i.imgur.com/OiLVvWz.png
the outerlines are only 2x2
thats fine
i only used 1 borders for the sheild badge thingy
because some ppl dont even keep the isaac style and make 1x1 borders
*cough cough* ab+
really?
at least it holds isaac style
<3
its pixel perfect
well
its a bit smol
eww its blurry but whatever :(
a pretty painful change
not the costume
i only made the item part
so like my hat is an item
I made a small head change
:)
and it my hat
i only made a hat
I want to see my bad sprite alrdy x3
yee
kyozm you are our hero!!
i got the keys to the kingdom
:9
O.o
kinda
but it works
yeah its a char
you got it?

show the code perhabs?
uhh
rippppppppppppppppppppppir
but all of the other characters are invivible
i did
wellllllllllllllll
Ugh, did someone make a working Costume thinggy?
I wonder if Transformations are possible
~~less work for them and more money~~
or someone else did it for them
uhh maybe they didnt make it themselves?
Why tf is it called Punk Credit then
that would be it

tfw u dont has anything that opens oggs
I don't remember hearing it ever
At least I don't think it's used
It's pretty lit
i bet it goes doodle doo
nice
woag!!
There is an unused music track in the game
no wait I never changed his txture yet
And a little thing none of you may have noticed
Word of advice
As you can see his Txture doesnt even render for unknown but probably known reasons
oh rip
It doesnt even work properly xD
can you share your magic
and stuffs
and codes
magics
ur magic!!
how?!?!?!
new Char slot babe
wait, did you replace a character to make a new one or did you magically make a new character slot <@146600389779783680>
lets see if his portrait in Boss Rooms will work
I should add Money = Power to his set, just becuase he looks epic in it
¯\_(?)_/¯
hah <@66197463593136128> never even solved the enigma code
yeah, but that happened to all of the other characters <@146600389779783680>
<@266032468853915650> callback takes one argument of type EntityPlayer
10/10
yup
isnt he amazing
I also got a char ?
i feel sorry for the people that did all this spriting and now want an easy way to add their stuff
*textures
I don't know if that's called when continuing a run or not
i just realised that my character takes away all of the other characters textires
<@266032468853915650> I think you could respond to the MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT callback
okay, someone said they changed the damage with their Demon Heart( was it? )
anyone figured out how to check if the run's been reset?
kthxbye
Fuck it, im going to sleep now and hopefully tyrone will have the blogpost online when i wake up. cya, nerds! ?
Any similar tools like Rick's StageConvert tool or Sirius_Black's map editor for Mac? Just trying to make some Isaac wallpapers easily without having to load each .png manually. Thanks guys!
probably tbh
tbh you probably can do everyything, but they didnt rly explain anything
you just also can't do a lot of things
you can do a lot of things
you pretty much can't do anything
<@186331772412231681> im trying. Nothing really came out of it.
._. can you do anything tbh xD
That seems like the way you would do it
Has anyone managed to add custom rendering by loading an ANM2 with the Sprite class?
you cant really change stats at the moment
it just returns your current tear damage
GetTearDamage(-1) probably won't do anything
getTearDamage doesnt take an argument
I didnt add player infront of it but too lazy to change that now
okay before I will do anything GetTearDamage( -1 ) would work rite?
weeb
wb
wb
i'm back guys
still trying to figure out which stats I should give my item
nvm
the hell is enigma code?
what
most ppl dont know how to use it, rite?
enigma code?
it's an arg
i don't think so
are there any draw functions besides RenderText
its still the new enigma code
and the rest is auto
they have two handwritten pages
it's automatically generated
they used doxygen
no i don't guess, i *know*
I guess
it's auto generated
they didn't write documentation
pfft
they wrote such a big documentation and encoding their thoughts behind that will take me years
keypress lua hook anyone?
and I think C is the bestie for now
or C I add the stats of the item
okay, either A. Im playing with item pools, B. Im trying to add the effect of the item
ok
I believe
name IDs work
uh, how am i going to give the character my new item if the item dosent have an id
but well, I need to add this item to the Item Pool now
well that sucks
Not sure you can do it
Oh, there's a guide sheet in gfx
The one in the GUI? I don't think you can add a custom one yet.
you got these mini icons for everything you had
when you die
gfx/ui/death items
Micro icon? Where is that used?
but I found the image source of these
idk
<@146600389779783680>  how do you put in the micro icon
I mean img
how would it know which one to pick
oh
this
Game():AddPixelation (10)
okay, now how do I add this garbage micro icon
Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking as well.
geez this icon looks like an egg with peacock tail feathers ?
might just try turning it into a general purpose utility library
Awesome. Would definitely appreciate that!
yeah, ill do it eventually
<@124718540413599744> Do you plan on uploading the source for the print to console?
still wondering tho
<@146600389779783680>  it should be automagically filled out in paint.net
because mod collides happen
just leave it blanc
dont use ids
y
are al imgs supposed to be 32 bits?
ok what should i use for the item id for my new item?
2nd dimension, spoopy
ive used it and its wierd
and theres also udim2
so u use x y z
Right.
i guess
Vector3s are 3d
3d vectors
ive used vector3s in roblox
thats all there is to it
Quick explaination: Vector is basically coords of the place x y
i meant how to use vectors in ab+
They're used a LOT in game dev/modding, so definitely a good thing to know about.
now i know what vectors are
i only used the spider to see if the code workd but thanks!
If you want to spawn it at the player - 
player:AddBlueSpider(Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y))
That would spawn the spider at the far top left
player:AddBlueSpider(Vector(0,0))
what do i use for a vector?!?!
but thanks!!!
yeah, but it still crashed without the code
You were passing two ints.
<@!152984637264756736> for your spider spawner, the issue is you weren't passing a vector.
<@124718540413599744> Like an infinite while loop?
ok im so pooped!!!
yeah but still, an error in the log would be way more helpfull than an minidump. But ill figure it out eventually
I can't not
Yup
In all fairness it's pretty easy to crash the game with lua
ahh!
SPOOKY!!!
so you can put like viruses on the workshop
uhhhkay. i figured out how to add anm2 files to an item. The problem is just, my game crashes on startup
wait
<@124718540413599744> wow you can upload spooky shit to the workshop
<@!152984637264756736> did you figure it out?
did you add the icon to the death list?
Good job
magic
How did you make a passive item
Faith-
Angel-
nice
it bleeds for you
DMG+1.5
HP+1
What does demon heart do  <@266032468853915650>
<@124718540413599744> Indeed, thanks.
Items
<@124718540413599744> http://i.imgur.com/pUe1KzD.png thanks!!
should i make this gfx/items/ into gfx/items/collectables
got it
wait
I think I have a basic idea where the small icons for the list are
Yay
until u die!!!!!1!
<@152984637264756736>
Until?
oke, thanks for clearing up
unless you add another "
a String cant be disturbed
oh crap i forgot to add a nickname
Acctually
the ' in the gfx path might confuse the game. dunno tho
now time to figure the list icon out

yay it works! thanks
<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <passive description="Cyka Blyat!" gfx="Collectibles_Only'shat.png" id="999" name="Only's hat" />
</items>
is there anything wrong with this?
Ok.
Mods work right when you activate them, but you need to restart for a custom title screen or music on the title screen.
and I should stop quitting the game, I should just reload instead
it only crashes when i get the item (my character has the item)
oh geez am I stupid ?
And the files just run on startup?
yea i do shawn
C:\Users\name\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\
gotta try
Ok, thanks!
When you save it, there is a dropdown with export options. Select 32 bit instead of 64 bit  <@146600389779783680>
<@152984637264756736> Do you have an items.xml file set up for it
Documents > My Games > TBOIA+ Mods
Where do you put the file to actually make it run in Isaac?
http://pastebin.com/x0VWtcAg
well, im also trying to make a item that just gives you a spider/fly
paint.net mostly
What are you using to sprite?
okay I give up on thinking what do you mean by export to 32-bit
thanks a  lot <@124718540413599744> !
So I've been working on ideas for a mod that should be fairly simple to code, though I'm not sure where to put Lua files. Anyone know?
IzlePox, the issue with passive stat up items right now is that nobody has figured out how to make them work, and there may actually not be a way to modify stats at all right now
should i just paste my code?
disclaimer that it includes a binary module and etc
Hello.
It replaces print() with a funciton that prints to the terminal
oh
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834354236
<@266032468853915650> This should work.
We're all trying to make a simple stat up item. But. Yeah.
Im getting confused, but it is 32bit if I remember correctly
Im just trying to make a simple stat up item ;-;
^^^
export img to 32-bits
i knowww
oh!
Or at least Tell me how to fix this O.o
or items in general
im still stuck on making a passive item
there's a gmod gamemode contest I'm trying to win
sorry I keep getting distracted
Im stuck on that for a while
any ideas how to asign a Costume to an Item
does anyone know how to attach an anm2 file to an item?
At least as far as I know.
Just here and the subreddit, really.
Are there any resources other than the half assed docs?
It'd be nice if the dev console just had a few more builtin things. Like, y'know. Print.
"But why not just tail -f log.txt" /sarcasm
and get a non-spooky version on github once I decide where people should install stuff
I'll edit the one I put on the workshop for now
^ do it
since that relies on an exploit that they hopefully patch
should probably throw it on github or something, not sure what the best way to release it is
I uploaded it as part of my "you can upload really scary shit to the workshop" proof of concept
our saviour is typing
I sort of did.
#bless
<@124718540413599744> pls bless us with your terminal
me too
i need this https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vY29nZy5yb2Nrcy91cGxvYWRzL2lzYWFjLW5nXzIwMTctMDEtMDRfMDAtMzQtMjIucG5nIn0.GZ8WeP9ZUOI0Z-7nGL0NLukXCgs
so is that where i can find the error logs from my mod right
Documments\My Games\The Binding Of Isaac Afterbirth\log.txt
Dose anyone even know where the error logs are
i wonder id it's possible to fix the docs
no idea. The Docs seem cryptic about it. but its probably a list ye
is it a list?
The Item History ?
GetItemHistory() returns what
SIIIIGH
*deepest sigh of allll*
nno clue if you can get that
this is the random num gen seed, not the run seed yeah
how fo i get the run seed then
i think the seed is just initialized at startup and thats it
can i have 2 lua files?
the text on top left is RNG():GetSeed()

Not much, but I just made some new hearts.
proof
http://imgur.com/a/jihi1
hm
when you reset game
getseed doesnt change
guys
Where can I find the error logs?
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834822248
:/
any External item descriptions" to AB+ ?
where's that?
where's that?
probably ON_PLAYER_INIT or whatever kyozm
<@266032468853915650>  that sould work, unless you do rng = RNG() first and then rng:GetSeed()
will RNG().GetSeed() work?
and u solved ALL THE PROBLEMS
going to sleep now... and hope that tomorrow... EVERYTHING IS BETTER <:isaac:257394072933761026>
ok im going to test if it works first
thanks
oh nice idea
getseed? ? <@266032468853915650>
just looked through the whole documentation... nothing
because variables stay the same
what should I use instead?
you guys know if there's a way to know it the game has been reset
and passive stuff with stats... should have an own class, because you can remove it and stuff.
ah kay
pretty sure too
no
they do?!
yea
hm
pretty damn sure its just for active items
uhh, will pasive items use ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM when picked up?
just test if they have the item in MC_POST_UPDATE
guys i need help making a passive item
I'm getting a limit exceeded error when uploading a mod. Any idea what the limit is on?
why would you even
but not dmg
SetFirstEnemyDead (boolean Value) they add this
When I used Vacuum, the stats disappeared. That means it cannot be something that triggers once.
I few thoughts about setting damage and other stats
absolute mad man
modname:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, modname.debug_text);
local text = "inactive"

function modnameg:debug_text()
    Isaac.RenderText(text, 35, 30, 255, 0, 0, 255)
end
can I somehow get what I hit with my tears?
would have to check what size the room is and shit..
yea..
you could just loop through all of them
GetGridEntity(index) just gives one at one index wanna have them all
<@266032468853915650> ye
anyone got Isaac.RenderText to work?
anyone tried getting gridentities?
(iirc)
ah ok thx
just Game(), XBagon
they do, yeah, but they share values with ModCallbacks so they can't be used in that
how do I reference Game?
looked at them.. no idea
looked at them.. no idea
how do I reference Game?
looked at them.. no idea
how do I reference Game?
how do I reference Game?
they look like callbacks. dunno, havent found anything that uses them
has anyone tried figured out what uses ActionTriggers yet
done
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834804568
o yeah definitely doable kappa
^^
not when it comes to this api
>Seems doable right?
so who's gonna start to make a vs modus were you explore the same floor but from different sides and then SHOWDOWN. Seems doable right?
oh okay
I can't make a whole new game if I can't figure out how the fuck sprites work
it means you can add, divide, subtract, and multiply vectors and that you can multiply colors
beh I have absolutely no clue how to do this
__mul is a method for the Vector and Color classes
Nothing
color does what with a vector? ?
i'm gonna tweet that to tyrone
color is a thing yes
xd
?
Color? wtf
`-_-`
even doxygen isn't impressed by the docs

thanks!
is it possible to spawn rooms? ?
Game():GetRoom()
idk
or something like that
is it possible to get the current room id?
but with SetAnimation (string AnimationName)
eh alright
not with Load
and see if the images pull with it
<@131576903722074112> the animations load the sprites within them, right? Try just loading an anm2
AddCollectible (CollectibleType Type, integer Charge, boolean AddConsumables) is the other one
ah ok
I just didnt look for the right thing
I know
collectible is item
I was looking for item instead of collectible
made it a lot easier to find which ones were messed up
didn't know that
Thanks!
ahh there we go. You can sort in folder by bit depth
ReplaceSpritesheet (integer LayerId, string PngFilename)
wait bitch what
player:RemoveCollectible(collectible)
How else would I
hm
Yeah
seems that way
<@!226519543588192256> with lua?
i couldn't say
does that make an instance of it in lua
thanks freezer baby
here's part of my code
```
local stupid = RegisterMod("StupidMod", 1)

local bgSprite = Sprite()


function stupid:postPlayerInit()
    bgSprite:Load("gfx/totallyblackscreen.png", true)
    Isaac.DebugString("bem")
```
pls make a mod that downloads the most disturbing images on earth and puts them into the game. thx
but yes
i don't remember how
yes
where are you getting one yo
Can you give and take away specific items?\
no I am
probably because you're calling it on the class, not a sprite object
ah
well, anytime I try to call it with a valid sprite path
it's in sprite
sprite
anytime I try to call it the game just crashes and no error explains anything
dumb question
where is that
wait sprite:load
because you had hopes in this shit for some reason
does anyone know how Sprite::Load works
uh
don't know why
idk i just sort of assumed that would be in yaknow
also i was going to have it increase damage on use permanently but fuck that i guess
idk
i could make it just spit it out like it rejected it?
i hope you saved the HAIRIMAGE in 32bit. not the character
and i need to make the item bounce batteries instead of absorbing them and doing nothing
save 32 bit
That isn't working for some reason
needs persistence still
increase speed stat using function?
it's not done yet
why do we have these and not set damage
SetLastLevelWithoutHalfHp (LevelStage Stage)
GetLastLevelWithoutHalfHp ()
<@96016391173332992> did you upload your item?
Well, I'm going to bed. Hopefully we'll get some cool stuff tomorrow. And I'll figure out how to put items into the item pool, heh. See ya
do it
hell yeah, im gonna upload that to the workshop
hahahaah
the alt-f4 key
Make it a parody on the r key from antibirth
i can try it again, might have been something else, but im pretty sure that it is xD
right this second
that's becoming a new item then
seriously
omg what
thats my guess
no spacebar item
maybe null is like
oh. my god. i found out what Game::SpawnEntityDesc (Entity::EntityDesc desc, Vector Position, Entity Spawner) does!
unbelievable stuff!
It makes the game crash ?
fuck this i'm tired
ok now i'm lost
boolean     IsCollectible ()
boolean     IsTrinket ()
boolean     IsNull ()
wait where is this meme function, in Isaac?
don't think so
maybe it means get and null item? so it returns an item and then removes it from the list of available items
it probably gets the item info from config
oh
i don't get it
but it's called getnullitem
like it returns an Item
Sometimes slightly stalls me, otherwise does nothing
ugh i don't want to open isaac again
try it????
what is null item????
```
local    dash = RegisterMod( "Dash", "1" )
local    dash_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Dash" )

function dash:use_dash( )
    local  VelBupdate =  player.GetVelocityBeforeUpdate()
    player.Velocity = player.Velocity + VelBupdate
end

dash:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, dash.use_dash, dash_item );
```
null item with an id
there isn't a getitem
what does this even mean
"GetNullItem (integer ID)"
new function that just create poop
lmao
tyrone is ironically murdered by a community member
<@85575792645386240> i dont know if there is a tool for that, but if you have photoshop, you can make an action for that. you just have to save those images as a png NOT INTERLACED or similar
ironically updates the api with show confetti function
this has to be an oversight
this has to be one of the first things they add
true i guess
honestly if the api will unironically be updated
lol
buuuuuuuuut not on missinghud
that way it'd work with brim and shit too
that's close i guess
er, check if the DamageSource is from the player entity then do more damage
they only care about black hearts
help
wtf
Wait so theres a RemoveBlackHeart() but Not just a RemoveHeart() ????????????
*some of
Moving a mod to ab+ and I messed up the sprites and made most of them 64bit possibly
they are even in antibirth api
tears should be entites
what the fuck ? why so many
<@174193097285173250> Is there a program to convert them fast? I have over 200 to convert
are tears entities?
erm, 1 sec
just get on entity damage for everything and deal some extra damage when it's hit or something although that won't detect if it's from tears i guess
will do.
uhm? try it i guess?
<@85575792645386240> save them in 32bit not 64bit
but theres no setters for them
Does anyone know what    
EntityNPC& Game::SpawnEntityDesc (Entity::EntityDesc desc, Vector Position, Entity Spawner)
returns and why theres a function for it
http://i.imgur.com/3c5VfTE.png you have all these
How do you fix sprites coming up with a big red box around them? Forgot what to do for that
really
just like with the rest of the stats
you can get tear damage but not set it
there really isnt
ye
like damage up or
add damage
is what?
lol, it's probably somewhere? I might actually accidentally "fall" out of my 11th story window if it isn't
inb4 give money = power and add coins
i'm still trying to figure out how to add dmg
we can figure out the args ourself
just the functions
not even arguments
just give us a text file with a list of functions kappa
mmm
well now we know what the hooks *are* we just don't always know how they are supposed to work!
better off not even including it to save face
but it's even funnier to me that they'd make such bad stuff and pass it off as documentation
it made me sigh
I mean I've worked with documentationless modding before
the documentation made me laugh
that's great too
also i appreciate that they made loading the lua scripts an inline thing instead of loading them asynchronously meaning the game stalls when you come back from the "mods" menu
best part of the docs tbh
xd
I love all of the empty boxes where the comments are supposed to be
my favorite part about all of this is that nicalis didn't even write out these functions for the docs. They wrote the part about the console then ran doxygen and it just made the entire "documentation" for them
thanks for the tips guys https://s3.amazonaws.com/img0.recordit.co/UFh2ku0MKc.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAINSRFOQXTN4DT46A&Expires=1483576482&Signature=VTM%2BedAH%2F%2FzSk9JZMvRUIEAm1I8%3D
oh true
maybe see what the version number in the xml file is too
1 has been working for me
make sure you delete update.it as well (I'm assuming you are doing that, but have to mention it anyway)
i mean idk if that will work but maybe :v
I'll try
Thanks
because when I changed 1 to "1" it stopped being marked as old
did you put 1 in your mod declaration or "1"
honestly I'm getting tired of this
[old]
i remember pretty well but it makes me cringe
I've had a lot of "wrong case" errors in my lua attempts too
so
i think
mhmm
Isnt the current version number 1.0?
although i've picked up the habit of _s recently from some language or another
same
the api's just weird
classes and namespaces in caps, variables and functions not. Thats atleast my golden rule
actually camelcase is recommended for lua
damn you lua for weird caps
i agree tbh
who writes functions with a capital beginning. thats BARBARIC.
^
isnt it HasCollectible? fairly certain other functions are like that
hasCollectible
any idea why that isnt working?
had to draw the line
function itemExpansion:check( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if hasDemonHeart == false and player.hasCollectible(player, demonHeart_item) then
      player:AddCoins(6)
      hasDemonHeart = true
    end  
end
gotta draw the line somewhere, I was supportive of one studio but they did everything to kill community-made mod support
and shipped it
they just checked if theres enough functions that spawn black hearts
i love being supportive for tyrone after he unloads a hot steaming dump of shit all over isaac
there are unquestionably some pretyt important things missing though, how they could overlook the fact that there's apparently no way to effect stats is... questionable
i dont know many devs that are that supportive to the community, now its our time to be supportive for them, too
if they get to the monthly mod roundup and there's no mods because the api is broken, they're going to look real bad
afterbirth+*
they try. and want to do good by afterbirth, but they just suck a little
remember they *want* the API to work because that's their content solution for the next year
except playing sounds, im still struggeling with that one
they seem to have released a half finished api but they could still patch in the other half
and because i think nicalis on a fundamental level are made up of decent people
afterbirth was shit when it came out and over a few weeks they patched int he bits that were broken
beeing hacky is kinda fun. I dont mind it ^^ I havent found anything that i couldnt get to work
bc i know i can work around most limitations
how do you people manage to keep positivity is beyond me
almost every modding API requires one to be hacky at times, but this one, maaan, you have to be hacky to do the simplest of operations. But im still positive that Tyrone will tweak the API in a good way
yo i'm the queen of hacky don't diss
sorta what i did
but thats sooo hacky
true
etc
like have 6 and only do it every 2 rooms
also custom charge mechanics should be a thing at that
theoretically you can have an internal charge number though
yep
yaeh it should, thats true ^^
it should allow you to add your own different size chargebars
I keep getting a "update.it" file
might be bad design, not apis fault tho
thats not the apis fault. if i remember correctly different sized chargebars have different sprites, which you can edit seperetly
this api sucks so much oh my god
hahahahahaahhah NO CUSTOM CHARGES EITHER
how do I update my mod
wow
i chose 5
onlz existing vals like 1,2,3,4,6 are allowed
Oh i found out what the problem with maxcharges  in the items.xml was
alright, I can't for the life of me figure out how this animation editor works either
that's what we're saying all the time
yes
only get
i'd think entityplayer but i don't see it
LOL true where is it
is there a function?
adddamage?
alrighty
put a variable in your mod table that's set to false, then on MC_POST_UPDATE check if that's false, then check if player has the item, and if so, set it to true and add damage or whatever
yeah but can you do SetDamage or something
Kyo just hack around and make it detect on item pickup
you guys know how to affect stats?
<@186331772412231681> any idea how to fix it?
nice
I don't think that I have managed to get it to work
lol it's not replacing @rpath with the path
how did you manage to get the items to appear in the item pools?
How do you actually access the modding tools?
https://ptpb.pw/aVpU.xml

works for me scayze
soon http://i.imgur.com/jeGRzSm.png
What's the exact error?
<@258285593224544256> What happens for you when you run the mod uploader?
you mean in the item.xml
my active always has a 1-room-charge
hmm, does anyone also have the problem that the "maxharges" attribute for new items doesnt work properly
i just would like the moduploader to work for me
i mean i have already written a few mods and the api doesnt seem that bad, but the documentation is just bad
this was posted 6 hours ago
finally, cant wait to see some good examples
here
its funny that ed retweeted that post xD
I'm so fucking mad
wew
<@258285593224544256> oh my fucking god tyrone RTd that
this is awesome, i mean the comment not the resprite
yeah...
MOD TOOLS amritie XDDD
nahhhhhh
oh wow its not like we can already retexture shit since rebirth
how does it come that i think that this guy hasnt used the lua api yet
thanks guys subscribe for more legend of bumbo news
antibirth ported
`local MOD = Isaac.MakeMod("antibirth")`
he said that tyrone was working on it
ok so you write
jesus christ
can you imagine ed giving an api tutorial himself
freezer baby is well coded tbh
ed said that there will be a blog post with a tutorial on how to use the api
Thanks
skip to the end
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m092c/how_to_do_things_with_the_ab_api/
my mod has an [old] tag and is red
my game takes like a minute to start anyway so idk
it's loading them
?
probably
Does everyone's game take longer to start up with mods?
in this API it took me too long to figure out how to make a black heart spawn when you hit an enemy with your tears
the problem is just that I'm no amazing coder but I always trust my ability to push the limits of a restrictive API
I can't tell if that's sarcasm or not portal??
That's an optimistic attitude
id much rather just whine at how bad the api is
figure shit out
i didn't have money, so i got a moped instead of a car :p
it's just like life, y'all. you work with what you've got
mod
boom
call it the broken R key
doesn't matter
oh well
nvm
Sure you can? Probably. 1 second.
but I can't possibly make it be basically the same stage that you did
BUT IT ISNT
make ? shit ? work
First time setup...
but
so don't copy paste that
in lua
so uh
also i don't know how random works
is it exactly like reset? maybe no
Just take it to first floor fam.
```
Level.SetStage(LevelStage.STAGE1_1, random(1,3)-1)
```
The joke is that it's completely redundant and unnecessary, right
I believe tyrone once said you could do some pretty 'low-level stuff' with the API, this gave me extremely false hopes
rather, wait for someone else to trial and error it
still funny
http://i.imgur.com/2c01Mpz.png this has to be one of my top picks
you could trial and error it
I don't think that would really work
a cringe compilation of documentation that doesn't exist?
im waiting for someone to make a cringe compilation of all of ab+ apis nonsense
I mean it's a really complex thing to ask for but tyrone and edmund made the API sound godlike when it's not at all
<@162156525337575425> RE: what you said above, I'm waiting for someone to properly document everything because I lack the intuition required to figure out what shit does from the two-word function names
meaning it does not seem to work like a reset
well I looked at Level.SetStage but I see it requires a stage subtype
WHY DOESNT ESC CLOSE THE FUCKING CONSOLE
>can't hold backspace
since it's safe to assume it's a derivative of that like spawn is from Game.Spawn
i hate the console so much
I'd assume it works the same as the stage variable in the console
probably
inb4 it just works same way as changing the floor variable in cheat engine
maybe
then boom
Figure out how to get that, and what the variables going in are
Level.SetStage
one sec
just from off of my head
sums up ab+ in a nutshell
That should be possible
"obviously not possible by looking at documentation"
obviously not possible by looking at documentation
I wanted an item that worked like the reset button thing from antibirth
then there's more info for the rest of us
that's what I did with what I'm working on
see if you can *find an angle* if you will
if they don't seem possible, try them
do something else then
the problem is I have like no ideas and the few ideas I do have are not possible in this API from all the studying I've done
exactly what i've been saying tbh
^^^^^^^
y'all give up to easy. I kick like a bitch on the way down
yeah but a lot of people are too busy talking shit about the api to actually make something...
this is a whole new world from that
think of what people did back when we could only edit animations
but we'll see
not amazing
with animations editing and that put together, as well as being able to shoot tears we should be able to make some at least decent stuff.
but
we don't know it exactly yet and pooping monstro doesn't tell us exactly
And they do have the tools in place to handle ai and shit i'd say
Good 2 know
but that's workable around
they're all added as variants of id 0
without an id
just like with items.xml
place it in content/entities2.xml
that's blatantly not how you do it...
so you can't have two mods at once
like each file you replace in resources/ just replaces the file
Can't compose?
but they can't compose
so yeah you can add new enemies
that content/ isn't documented at all
The problem is
but they gave us the keys on that
no one's tapped into them yet
ah yes
also, none y'all can deny they gave us pretty great enemy making tools
if similar methods can be applied to this API many things are possible
I remember on the fanmade undertale battle engine that lacked features, I said screw the lack of control and just entirely remade the built-in UI using sprites and put a black overlay over the default UI
https://ptpb.pw/JPM9.xml
https://ptpb.pw/YiVE.lua/lua
For now it will be hacks upon hacks
Gimme
everyone else refuses to accept it because it's hacky but
i mean
like a consumable like coins
i love it
it's cool
I made a collectible item thing!
to be expected
nothing, API and documentation still garbage
nothing
I've been gone 8 hours, what important things have I missed?
we wouldn't need to sit here arguing on what the api can and can't do if they T O L D U S
true
yeah but we could already remove from item pools so
:p
hold on time to go spend hours trying this out
remove from item pools at least
actually it does seem somewhat possible to make a new game
Some part of the game expects a hardcoded ID and goes o shit
i doubt it works
hah
or if we can do it
The game freaks out
idk how removing content works actually
I want to make a mod that removes AB+ content, but I need to buy AB+ first
We already can use space as a trigger
based on what you define as a game
Probably even can do it already
I mean, we're really not that far away from making custom games now.
by allowing me to override controls and have decent drawing functions
I believed it because some stupid undertale battle API that had very few features allowed me to do it
Good news is, apparently they're planning to update the api. Bad news is we don't know whether they'll cause more damage than good :p
depends on you definition on "new game"
of course i never believed it either
to be fair, that's exactly how they described it
that sounds like a bit much tbh, I was never expecting them to follow up on that
a successful API has the ability to make whole new games
i'm getting fairly complex with my mod i'm working on
we might be able to add floors in a hacky manner
and it depends on your definition of complex i guess
we can add bosses and basic items
and make custom items
we can add bosses
I'm guessing we can't add new floors, make new bosses, add new custom items, do complex actions.
shrug
i dont get it
whats the point of the item pool editor if it doesnt seem to support modded items???
while y'all circlejerk
it's about on par with what I had in the way that I can't do anything complex I want to do with it
compared to basement renovator
the room editor isn't that good
Now I'm gonna use this to make some cool shit.
Room editor is good. Don't know about item editor.
magic
thanks jerry
end of story
if it's not better than what *you* had, then use what you had that was better
<@162156525337575425>
chill
it's better. than what. we had.
I don't know this thing. The only thing I had was some okay art skills and portal-chan's character editor.
like?? i don't get the actual complaint here tbh
it's much more difficult but it can do more
ok then go make assembly mods, Travoos
well you can use that but there's no argument that antibirth's going to have a lua api soon anyways
I make a point of not getting upset when something's not as good as i wanted as long as it's better than what I had
not better than what I had tbh
y'all can go piss on each others' pants as long as y'all want but there's no argument it's better than what we *had* to make mods
but the syntax
it's good i guess
i mean
yeah that was assembly and assembly is garbage
so w/e
and make cool as fuck shit with it
and I can't do that in afterbirth+'s API
that even if it's bad we'll make it work
to be entirely fair i said from the beginning
to put it in perspective I made a custom item change stats in afterbirth using my newbie basic knowledge of assembly
here we go
This is what happens when you set up a team to make a good mod expansion, and than it's crap.
yep it's hacky
it's just not any easy way
how?
oh this is news to me
you can, to be fair
tears up? nope, not happening
even if we can't create a good display in it
to put it in perspective <@!117109151334662144> you can't even have items change stats
i'm talking about an actual consumable
the pills are easier actually
i'm going to add about 50 neutral pills
hold on
oh boy a consumable
yeah
by a country mile ye
to be fair adding a custom consumable hasn't been too difficult, so that's a plus at least
So, I'm guessing we're agreeing Antbirth is better than AB+, or nah?
It's all horribly documented so it's taking time for people to unravel it, but any time a revelation is made it's never good
and none of it got in
they did
Why the heck did they make it then if they never asked the community what they wanted in it?
AND WE HAVE A WINNER
DING DING DING
ding
Correct!
Yes?
take a wild guess
Is the mod creator they added trash?
mh Ok. thanks tho
and that's just a random thought
lord knows
I'd guess something along the lines of creating an invisible entity, spawning it, playing a sound, and deleting it
mm, nope
I got something like that: 
player:ToNPC():PlaySound(6660,1,0,false,0)

wont work tho
Has anyone figured out how to play sounds in code?
should be able to
yeah the spawn command worked ty guys
can you spawn champions via console?
AB+ in a nutshell http://i.imgur.com/fxTlJ6H.png
this seems correct
you can make a champion
yeah i was wondering about the subtype too
no, you don't
i don't know spawn yet
don't know if you need the subtype for a standard spider, don't think so
shrug
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_SPIDER,0,0,Isaac.GetRandomPosition(),Vector(0,0),player)?
ok so 1 second longer
code
Lua console or code, <@258285593224544256>
um, 1 sec and i should be able to
haha
can somebody give me a spawn command for a spider that attacks the player
or harass tyrone to fix his shit api
and adding the entity
make making a pickup as easy as calling a couple functions, probably
But I can abstract it out after that ez
that'll be hacky
I might have to fuck around a little bit for persistence, though
it's just because it's a straight-up entity and not an entitypickup that it's any trouble at all
it's really not very hacky
release IT
https://ptpb.pw/JPM9.xml/xml
and let me post the xml
nice ;)
not really actually
maybe antibirth will work then
YOU CAN REMAKE A N T I B I R T H IN THIS
https://ptpb.pw/YiVE.lua/lua
hacky as shit?
NO CUSTOM PICKUPS
oh god sounds like its hacky as shit then
good api
wew lad
also sure 1 sec
but that's all
when you leave the room
I'm working on keeping it persistent
post code
into item pool PogChamp ?
how did you manage
rip
that's what i meant to put
oh
passive?
custom pickup implemented
whew lads
so
ok
yea look at the enums
ok so you have like the main class and then sub classes?
variants and subtypes
```lua
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP, PickupVariant.PICKUP_HEART, HeartSubType.HEART_BLACK, e.Position, Vector(0, 0), player)
```
i dont understand the second and third argument
my example black heart spawner
ok i try
i think
it'd be EntityType.SPIDER_BABY?
also its not just spider_baby
what Vector are you using
Isaac.Spawn(SPIDER_BABY, 0, 0, Vector, Vector, player) for example should spawn A spider baby
what dont you get about it
yea
does somebody know how Isaac.Spawn works
for 5 coins
it gives you keys/bombs if you have zero
so it gives you consumables when you pick up money?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlXi4T7dLpo&feature=youtu.be
so to spawn a spider baby i would have to write that?
transit gives up and uses antibirth api when
Isaac.Spawn(Entity.SPIDER_BABY, 0, 0, Vector, Vector, player)
have u lost faith in api yet
it gets fucking pickup items
it is NPC update after all ?
eat my asshole
onnpcupdate doesn't work with ENTITY_PLAYER??
f u c k m e
ty
https://moddingofisaac.com/docs/group___enumerations.html
is there somewhere a list of all the entities and their ids
if we make it really high then...
so an item with weight 2 is twice as likely to spawn
it's probably probability related
what doews weight do on item pools?
Isaac.Spawn
like what is the function to spawn enemies
but it's not very composable
how can i spawn for example spiders in my mod
and that seems to work
I know that if you add things to resources/ you can wholesale replace xml files
but does it?
have it on content folder
probably
this should add the item 511 to the treasure pool
<ItemPools>
    <Pool Name="treasure">
        <!--Cool Item-->
        <Item Id="511" Weight="1" DecreaseBy="0.5" RemoveOn="0.1"/>
    </Pool> 
</ItemPools>
Don't feel bad, most are probably happy enough to answer them
i feel bad for having to ask all these questions lol
can we add items into an item pool yet?
IsVulnerableEnemy( )
ok ty
with IsVulnerableEnemy ?
Entity:IsEnemy()
how can i check if an entity is an enemy and not something like a tear
but at least it can do more
and that's even more of a pain
thanks
honestly I'd rather continue modding afterbirth instead of afterbirth+
>is this guy for real
As soon as the API is complete
Man, I am going to be so sleep deprieved, haha. Finally got the perfect game to mod
maybe

ìs there any way to prevent update.it from constantly reappearing
Do we know how to set a sprite for a passve item in the item hud yet?
so that's nice
interesting, you don't even need the RegisterMod variable to be global
transit: use : instead of .
yeah, i would've been too, but just wanted to confirm
<@72413153614368768> Nice, would be suprised if they couldn't honestly
what the fuck
just like
i'm just using the npc variable
what
```
[INFO] - [Flask] Error in MC_NPC_UPDATE call: .../share//binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/flask/main.lua:42: bad argument #1 to 'Exists' (Entity expected, got table)
```
just confirmed that
ok, mods can use functions from other mods
ok
updated the greenisaac workshop page
Forgot one line
<@258285593224544256> `local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()` before that, sorry
<@258285593224544256>
i'm gonna go test if mods can use other mod's functions
is how I did it
``` for i = 1, #entities do
            if entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
                if entities[i]:HasMortalDamage() then
                    player:SetActiveCharge(player:GetActiveCharge()+1)
                end
            end
        end ```
shouldn't be difficult to extract itempools.xml and diff both files
this is how isaac modloader begins
hey does anybody know how to detect if an enemy died?
I can't imagine why it wouldn't
dunno if that would even be possible
and th ebase mod would create a lot of functions and general ease of use things
Sorry if this duped, discord is fucking up, but has anyone looked at the item pools to see exactly what nicalis fucked up? Why bag of pills is in the gold chest pool, etc.
we should create a "base" mod that we make mods require on the steam workshop
I'm implementing a trinket in such a convoluted manner at this point I'm doing it for the sake of the implementation alone
Ok
Meet Ahmed he starts with a Quran and 5 bombs
Nice, made an item to give you one charge every time you kill an enemy
So far so good
Nice, made an item to give you one charge every time you kill an enemy
Nice, made an item to give you one charge every time you kill an enemy
MC_NPC_UPDATE  doesn't work for anything with type below 10
Sorry for not a strictly-modding question, but has anyone looked at item pools to see exactly what nicalis fucked up
MC_NPC_UPDATE  doesn't work for anything with type below 10
does MC_NPC_UPDATE work for the player? or do we need to use another callback?
i suggested to kilburn that his api use alphabetical id's instead of numerical ones
I can't possibly comprehend how someone can release an API without all these basic features you could 100% expect in any API ever
no the api's just bad
Yup. And you can't even use challenges to give yourself the item since the item ID might be different
god damnit
I'm a real life idiot
the only known way to add items to the item pool is to use the item ID, an auto-assigned value that will change with multiple mods installed
but still it's literally in the docs
true
yeah
yeah
*nil
what?
Wait.. getentityvariantbyname is null now???
holy shit
travoos seriously
coll
new dlc
XD
what
guys we just have to solve the API ARG
unlocks? you're asking a bit much for an API that can't even add custom items to item pools (from my knowledge)
with the current api, i doubt we can make our own unlocks
it apparently doesnt even have a lot of unlocks
delirium is a pretty bad boss fight
ok we solved that quickly
fucking hell
oh

no clue
<@!182509747835109387> what's binding of steven before greenisaac? nothin, even eluc thinks so
no one has a clue?
i dont know what a room subtype is
I thought people knew that :p
problem is
thank god
thats cool
yea
oh really?
yeah
that gives it [old]
shows the error
The log where it tried to load your mod
Guys!!!!!
but seriously guys, rooms have a value for subtypes, what does that do
oshit got 25 subscribers on my mod
it's very good api
ofc! not!
Did anybody find out how to edit stats?
Ok, thanks! ^^
<@259579937953021952> Yes, it is possible to do, but the API is hard to understand.
<@259579937953021952> Yeah, it's possible, but currently the API is quite limited
he doesnt have a nose anyways
NO
But does Judaism live in Isaac?
Hi! I'm new here, I just wanted to know if it's possible to create new items with the mod tools. ?
YES islam lives in Isaac
k
eyy its kk
guys, what are room's "subtypes"?
<@72413153614368768>  we should make a bigger mod together ?

i guess
I guess only mum?
best challenge ever ? until I have 0 bombs
PogChamp challenge
great
hm whatever let it be
okay so i can spawn an entity but it's not persistent
wasn't there a challenge with it
LOL
not sure
same thought
does no.2 work with blindfold?
maybe only no.2 ? ?
oh yeah
Bomber boy? you need bobby-bomb ?
i meant the game
not you FiveVi oh no
try deleting the mod from your mods folder and starting the game back up
no cannot find the challenge <@72413153614368768> just started the game with no custom challenge avaialabe and it crashed FailFish I wonder why
It tends to knock bombs to the top of the room
hm... i might want to remove Bomber Boy from the challenge
;3;
what's wrong you little cunt
How do these dices looks like ?
DAMNIT
GOD FUCKING
FLASK[OLD]
some people came in to check the fire detector while i was literally smoking out the window w h o o p s
should be downloading fine
you can require a mod on steam workshop
<@72413153614368768> not out yet?
yeah, i've got the challenge
typed it wrong
I wish it was
oh
no
RequireMod is a thing?
also wait
What was the 29.8 Mb update yesterday?
maybe I failed updating
alright tme to test this shit
Wait, you can't?
cannot find the challenge :/
didn't Edmund say you'd be able to create a whole new game with this?
also who in their right mind would give you 1 lua file to work with

Kappa
ok why does it do this?
lol.
wait, lemme just look in your code
how
guess how I remove the items with the vacuum LUUL
cause diplopia won't work with it
If it's dumb but works, it's not dumb
kinda works, that is
yea
but it works
yeah it's super dumb
I had that idea <@72413153614368768> and then I thought.. "hm no that's too dumb" ?
*People get hyped for modding ABI*
xdddd
i'm pretty sure it's gonna be "Port AB+ to Antibirth"

Guys
*hearts
is there a xml file for pickups?
and it doesn't even work if you pick up a second copy of the item
it shouldn't be this complicated to make it so that something happens when the item is picked up : https://hastebin.com/rodanodimi.lua
Maybe they though we wouldn't notice with their documentation? lo
Challenge PogChamp
i have no idea
how the fuck did nicalis have the balls to ask for antibirth to be ported with this shit api
i've updated my explosive fuse mod to add a challenge and have it give 5 bombs when picked up
cant even make a DMG up
simplest fucking shit cant be made with this
it wont be
i'll  start beliving in miracles when antibirth gets ported with this API

then let's work on the binding of greysaac ?
yes?

RACIST
Working on the binding of whitesaac or blanksaac
it's ok
<@182519885669072906> you also didn't capitalize ModCallbacks on your last line
i hav eno idea. but at least we have getters for them!
http://i.imgur.com/CjdjMKB.png *
wow holy fuck how can you overlook stats
http://imgur.com/a/9Rr8S.png ye boi
...... ?
Pretty sure that's one of the big things that's missing.
nope. don't think so.
has anyone found a way to change player stats when an item is picked up
Yeah add another 255 onto the end.
basically ?
x, y, r, g, b, alpha
so i need to add one ?
oh ok
yeah
opacity
Yup
one for alpha
four 255s
?
<@182519885669072906> you're missing an arg to Isaac.RenderText
I wonder if NPCs update when you leave the room. Let's see!
Did that and it still doesn't work
local mod = RegisterMod("RandomMod",1)

Isaac.DebugString("Plz work")

local function.render(_mod)
    Isaac.RenderText("Fuck you !", 50, 15, 255, 255 ,255)
end

mod:AddCallback(modCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER,render)
i feel so dumb
blaagh
that's what it's assigned to by default
entity null
it's 0
you're right
duh
wait
So I need an enum
No, I'm setting a callback when it updates
things that say they take a "CollectibleType" actually just take an integer, it's a lie
are you not able to just use GetEntityTypeByName
entity type enum for custom entities?
just checked, you're health stays, Ok I guess
thx
<@120355885615808512> the new item's pretty good :D
which is a bitch
I'm currently trying to figure out the entity type enum for custom entities
let me put it that way
but it's applicable
well, it's not what you're saying
I'm maintaining an internal charge
https://ptpb.pw/PpJr.lua/lua
let me share my current code real quick
There should be, Travoos
I set the item's max charges to 60 and used this code
```
function bhm:postUpdate()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    if(player:GetActiveItem() == bookofdenial and player:GetActiveCharge() < 60) then
        player:SetActiveCharge(player:GetActiveCharge() + 1)
    end
end
```
the green stuff is in so ... was ok simple
what was your method
I mean, I made one but it's stupid because it doesn't render correctly and it plays a noise every frame while it's charging
is there a way to make a timed charge
d2 should be simple
any thoughts? the crossed-out stuff was ripped by void and the new blind item.
I've managed to make a mod that means you can only move by jumping, but I'm still figuring out how to make you invincible while you're in the air
it's seeming a bit more viable now
True
If you haven't coded before I would wait a few weeks
So far the API is cool, even though limited and probably unfinished
mh
and we probably need help ourselves, haha
right now we're all kinda floundering around
There should be some tutorials on the subreddit
for ab+
i mean
no i just want to start modding in general
do you have a specific question f
could someone help me with modding plz ? ?
;3;
bingo. you're a prince among men, thefinaluptake
...
<@72413153614368768> check out my new item ?
they should definitely have made at least *some* of the items using the lua tools yeah
had same problem
yeah
hm, you think?
local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        local ent = entities[i];
        local npc = ent.ToNPC();
two problems fixed, lack of examples and API issues
<@141645059782213632> use a : instead of a . before the function name
???
and I don't think that's so baaad ;D
Can someone help me with modding.... Lua modding...
xD
I saw that
make the damn expansion IN lua
has a five minute isaac sprite tutorial
there was a very simple way to get the API working.
check the pinned messages
i'm not a spriter myself ?
Better than releasing them together and the Api and the expansion being absolute shit
how the hell am I getting a "wrong argument" on a function that takes -no arguments-
gimme sprite <@66197463593136128>
thanks^^
the first part is enough for me
Would've been fine
Get all the modding tools in like February finished
haha
Get the expansion of AB+ like in december
<@120355885615808512> cool item, not cool sprite
I would've been totally down for that
main.lua:8: bad argument #1 to 'ToNPC' (Entity expected, got table)
GetItemPool seems to return a non-typed Lua blob
*It sounds smart because compared to Nicalis' competence, it is*
The_Trust_Melon: Yeah, there are some functions in the API that just do nothing
because hype
And give the modding tools all at once
And say modding tools will follow
Release the actual expansion itself early
(Great idea here)
Or better yet
**Why didn't they delay the game until all the features were in there**
**Why didn't they delay the game until all the features were in there**
what do i do? xD
But now here's the thing
check this cool new item out ? https://youtu.be/Uy3cR_6VIAg
there's still hope
Because that's what it sounds like
Is not all features are in the modding api
What I'm getting here
So wait
For those of you interested in modding AB+, we're adding new features in upcoming updates this week
i could remake that in half a second with antibirth api
You have to call matthias bossi on the phone and ask him to tell you which one of the 300 undocumented hooks is for on-room-clear
soon boys
go to California and dig up the documentation
but that was true last expansion so why did we expect anything different
it's just they should have had that more before release
http://i.imgur.com/7CdIvdT.gifv
I mean you can claim it's unfinished and that it could be good given more time given that they've, said that they're adding more of it >_>
arg for missing mod tools
**BUT DONT TOUCH THE MODDING TOOLS YET NOT EVERYTHING IS IN THERE**
This is what they think is good
You can't claim it'd be better if they had more time, it's done baby
I mean the modding API is finished, it's just awfully-documented and (off of everyone's cursory glances) super limited
*In other news this dlc comes with a new character and enemies*
lol
over 1 year in developement.
***SHITTING ME***
You
Are
And they didn't finish the modding api
any other sites?
With a solid release date
I wanna show you cool shit and gyfcat doesn't work
They gave us a completed game
So wait wait wait
why does gyfcat freeze my first 10 seconds?
it's so stupid
I don't think so
and it'd work with empty rooms too right
can you even change the player stats?
but no ON clear
but
you can use that
Room:IsClear()
The Isaac developpement method was probably too scrumy
xDDD
>this doesnt
the docs are so fucking shit
>shitty antibirth api has an on room clear hook
good they didn*t work on it for a year before Kappa
Well, if he patched in some doc, I'd say our modding ability would be hundred-fold
Also, who knows how to add a callback or something similar on room clear?
thank goodness
PRAISE
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/816540034895462400
the rest of the api
more mod support lol
Patching what in
Tyrone did tweet though last night and say they were patching it in
still they were missing half the afterbirth content on release, maybe they'll patch it in :v
That's the joke I made yesterday.
That must be it
it does seem like they've gone off half-cocked again
god i never thought i'd hope for an arg
lmao
Maybe the real modding tools are hidden behind a patch that will be released when we manage to solve the AB+ ARG
`EntityPlayer.SetActiveCharge (integer Charge)`
Who was the person yesterday struggling with setting charge
Um, guys?
I have an idea
Guys
them*
When i go to rebirth folder there arent classic images if i reinstall game will i see it ?
is it possible to add costumes to enemies?
Fucking wow
Your best bet is downloading stuff off the workshop and looking at it.
None of the game's items are coded in lua
<@124248443383185408> yeah. we all are.
Because I'm basically going in blind-ish
Oh, whoops. misread what you were asking.
So I can work off stuff
I knew this^^ thx anyways
Where is all of the code of other items?
does anybody know how i can add a costume to an enemy
Throw that into the end of the use function for the item
<@120355885615808512> player:RemoveCollectible(Isaac.GetItemIdByName(str itemname))
motherfucker
so basically i only know how to add charges when the item is on a goddamn pedestal
>>edmund thinks so
when i reinstall game i can find them on recourse
lmao
>cant even do simple on pickup shit
>people think antibirth can be ported to this
just reinstall the game if you messed something up
aint that illegal?
graphics folder *
who can give me gfx folder or graphics on rebirth
f u c k
so i can't do charge + 1
I know
guys
I can
I thought I saw a way to remove items earlier. Let me check again
damnit
god
after you pick it up
it's not an entity pickup
hahaha
wait, fuck. thoughts
god knows how
i guess you'd just remove it bagon
made a ring that lets you dodge roll through enemies
I'd have thought so except someone else was doing it yesterday
<@154701703474577408> it may be like half the other things, where there's no way to set it.
how can i set active items to one use?
anyone know how I turn on iframes? I know someone had it yesterday but I can only find the getters for "InInvincible" and not the setter
I'm going to listen to when he gets an item for an on pickup item
it's a fair point
is an on pickup callback really that hard to make, nicalis?
and if it goes up, do whatever
store his current coin value
that might be for if an item has been picked up and put back down
Then listen to isaac's npc updates
didnt work
i iterated over every entity and if it was touched, tried doing something
but try this
hm
for a coin, obviously
i think i tried doing something like this and the Touched thing did not work for me at all
But that's my closest guess
That might not work.
Erm, okay, thoughts, <@162156525337575425> 
```
function Mod:check_pickup( npc )
  if npc.Variant == PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN then
    if npc.ToPickup().Touched then
      -- Do thing
    end
  end
end

Mod:AddCallback( ModCallback.MC_NPC_UPDATE, Mod.check_pickup, EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP )
```
also off topic I just realized
I've seen two videos of the delirium fight, and both have the boss shooting bullets affected by slow, is that how it always is?
love ya ? <@186331772412231681>
Anyone knows how to select and edit a tear you create?
easy to fix I just think it's funny
<@209476116862337027> 
Call `Game()` to get the reference to the game glass
lol my "you can only move while jumping" mod makes it impossible to die because it keeps interrupting the "you have died" animation with the "jump" animation
how do you get a reference to the Game class? that's not Isaac, is it?
anyone figured out how to do something when the player picks up an item? passive items are useless atm
hopefully
well, i'm making my own pickup, but let's see if I can figure that out
cause i cant even figure out how to do something on consumable pickup because the api fucking sucks!!!
That's what I'm trying to make right now
i havent tried but i wondered if its possible to make a spacebar item that charges on pickups, kinda like antibirths alabjshed box or whatever
with `Item.Charge = Item.Charge + 1`
i haven't messed with the api much so
has anyone tried to increment the charge of an item?
guys?
uhm?
anyone had a go with particles?
great api with tons of potential, huh? ?
i'm gonna make myself not nevermind
no i'm not
I'm gonna completely abandon my previous task and work on this
agreed
maybe it'd work better
the players.xml they used has an id="0", i feel like that should be removed
deletes the paper...
true apollyon...
yeah he had a wheel with like 100 issacs on didnt he
didn't tyrone fucking show a picture of him adding a bunch of extra characters
hold on
just look at the screenshot lel
let's look at this
oh nice
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lycmy/succes_in_adding_extra_character_some_drawbacks/
i saw someone on the sub trying it
?
and it, presumably, doesn't fucking work
Also, we've tested adding a character, I assume?
who?
are you sure?
http://i.imgur.com/yp2j5II.gifv
progress on "play as monstro" making headway :v
let's see
or on npc update item pedestal?
got it
so on npc update, player
Oh, gotcha
cant find a way
ive tried figuring out how to do something on consumable pickup
that was one of the things people have found to require a hacky workaround i think
^
Uhm, call me dumb, but how do I make something happen on item pickup
I imagine you'd check to see if the room id equals it
well since the starting room has a specific id
is there any way to find out if the player is on the starting room?
AddCallback not AddCallBack ^^
seems ok though
no idea only that it's still weird that it's USE_ITEM
Hey is there a way to change the texture of custom items here
anything wrong with that line?
explosivefuse:AddCallBack(ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, explosivefuse.add_bombs, explosivefuse_item)
lemme do that now
oh yeah, forgot about that
I like it, you just have to add the +5 bombs
?
aaand with remote detonation
yeah, it's a basic item on its own but it gets so much better with bomb synergies
<@72413153614368768> your item does it all https://gfycat.com/ExemplaryLittleFlyingfox
I'm still shocked that the only thing nicalis could've done worse was release no index of functions at all
nice meme
heh nice one...
LUUL
hey guys wanna hear a joke? Docummentation.
oh man
or something similar
<@72413153614368768> you need to add a challenge with this build+ blindfold
but I don't even get a filename
prolly
amazing
<@155802905671237633> Sounds like you forgot to close a tag or something in your xml
<@72413153614368768> seems useful https://gfycat.com/LameCompassionateCopperhead
I'm sorry tyrone
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rapidxml::parse_error'
  what():  unexpected end of data
probably
just slip gaben a dollar and i'm sure he'll comply!
can you not appeal for a 4th one?
rip
eh I already used the 3 steam id bans I'm allowed to issue with no questions asked for this month
he could actually make you.
did you know that limt works at valve?
make me
stop modding
SO EVERYTHING'S GREENN
i'm trying to make a hue shift
no
<@266032468853915650> Are you looking at the Tilt Shift shader code?
for the shaders thing
Not in AB+ yet
just output the text at the players position and figure out at what x,y position the text is at when it's in the top left/ bottom right
anyone messed around with status effects yet? (burn, fear, charm, etc)
alloyed, do you know how 2 shaders?
No, but I have an idea on how to find out
is there a screen resolution thing yet so i can position text by entities at the proper ratio or somethin?
oh wait, nvm
No need for a variable
For me it worked to just put in Vector(0,0) directly
Not like I can tell you how to code, though
Also, is creating a variable really necessary for this? It's not like it'll be used anywhere else
yup
Maybe?
is this how i create a new Vector?
local velocity = Vector(0,0)
i might make it every 10th frame
Ah.
yes
Also, wouldn't that create a bomb every frame?
oh right
the 0 is just an integer, the function calls for a Vector
You have player:FireBomb(player.Position, 0)
do you know what my error could be? i think it is something with my callback
local bombyRide = RegisterMod("Bomby Ride", 1)

function bombyRide:layBomb()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:FireBomb(player.Position, 0)
end

bombyRide:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_UPDATE, layBomb)
It would be nice if there were a bit of an easier way to make tear effects considering how many of them are in vanilla...
ok i will try player.Position now
less hacky
ok yeah that does work, good
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:AddBlueSpider(player.Position)

didn't work for me for some reason, but I'll try it again now, it probably was just a syntax problem
I used it in my mod
.Position should work
Maybe you accidentally typed `player:Position` instead of `player.Position`
Isaac is always entities[1] but I would have thought I'd be able to just grab it from the entityPlayer class
Next I want to make a tear effect that teleports an enemy to a random other enemy
(obviously in your case you'd want to fire a bomb instead of adding a spider :P)
grabbing position from entityPlayer didn't seem to work, ended up having to go:

local entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
player:AddBlueSpider(entities[1].Position)
Thanks :)
I've had more trouble getting the player's position than you'd expect
<@72413153614368768> I see no. Looks like fun. certainly one of the best items from the workshop lol
player.Position
and how do i get the player position as vector
yeah
well if you want to place a bomb you presumably don't want to give it starting velocity :P
0 velocity means they wont move anymore
ok
you probably want 0 velocity
someone added challenges, let's see how this is done
entityplayer:FireBomb (Vector Position, Vector Velocity)
i cant find it in the docs
what is the command to place a bomb
it can get slightly absurd if you have something like Bomber Boy + Pyromaniac + Remote Detonator + Explosive Fuse
anyone here has any experience with shaders?
gonna try it
t
wha
if you have remote detonator it explodes infinitely
not bad
oh
oh
it makes bombs explode twice pretty much
is it like the trinekt in antibrith?
wait what does this <@72413153614368768>
It works for me on 10.11.6
is MC_POST_UPDATE at the end of every frame?
look at it. IT'S BEAUTYFUL
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323&searchtext=
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834555291
like it only rerolls coins?
<@72413153614368768> send link
<@!173420370773147649> I did a d20 for coins... soo that's something I think
would be nice if i could actually add the item to the item pool though
just uploaded my first serious mod
10.11.2 is my current version
<@258285593224544256> what version of Mac OS?
i will try wine maybe
beyond things that are not interesting from a gameplay standpoint
i thougt that it should be available for mac since it had a macos folder in it
but you cant really make them do anyhting
well yeah, you can add new items
<@186331772412231681> it says that it is probably not available for my os
<@66197463593136128> it's just not showing up in my game but I made it so I'm not sure if that is the reason
I mean that's what we wanted, right? "new" items?
"i am on a mac and when i want to start it, i get an error
is there some other way that i can upload it"

What's the error?
what is the callback again, so it gets updated every frame
if it's just an empty mod, it does what it says on the tin
all this has done so far is attempt to kill moddingofisaac
but it replaces raw liver 10/10 best api
that raw steak sprite isn't bad
totally deserved
uhm
40 subs
i'm not about to test it
Yeah I have random macos files all over the place and I've hardly ever even touched a mac.
Are you serious
<@!173420370773147649> i saw it
Is this mod working for anyone else? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834259118&tscn=1483530400
i didnt think that many people still played isaac
my mod already has more than 10000 views
that's just a residual file
not necessarily
the weird thing is that the moduploader has a macos file inside of it so i think that it should be for mac
and there are exactly 4 items xD
i cant use the moduploader
I think mine is the item with the most complicated effect in the workshop LUUL
you can create weird tears that do pathfinding but you cannot set itempool for your custom item
because the api's basic
yeah
tbh most of the mods in the workshop are basic stuff
that makes no sense
<@66197463593136128> I mean you can do complicated stuff.. the easy stuff is the greater problem  with this
well i just want to get used to the api and cant figure out how to use the moduploader
so yeah you can do it
the most basic thing
that's like
permanent explosive diarrhea?
just for fun
i think i will make a mod now that lays a trail of bombs behind isaac
nvm I got it
i cant figure out how to start the mod uploader
can't figure it out
can someone give me an example of a mod with MC_NPC_UPDATE but with the player
do i just have to start the mod uploader?
windows needs to stop drinking so much
i'll try
use the .sh file, assuming it's the same as on linux
windows version on WINE?
I don't think so
is there some other way that i can upload it
i am on a mac and when i want to start it, i get an error
yep
do i have to use the ModUploader application in the tools folder
how can i upload it
I will sub PogChamp
go for it
i think i will upload my mod
I checked them all ?
Like I said
no
did the pizza thing add its mod to the item pool?
in that case just do the other thing I said
there is no update.it
RicePrezPip, delete "update.it" from your mod folder and then change the first line to
local   mod = RegisterMod( "name", "1" );
my mod is way cooler than the pizza thing, still only half of the subscriptions FeelsBadMan
and with update callback?
okay, i get it now. gettrinketidbyname, pass the name, get the id, hastrinket, ezpz
send me the log
even though i literally gave birth to it today
FailFish
according to my log, my mod is old
ok
yes
I hate this.. mods with the tag items.. just retexture... what is this? 2015?
there is an error running the loser mod, might be a compatibility issue???????????
it isn't helpfully located in the same folder as the mods or anything
it is log.txt
Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+
if you go to my games > binding of isaac afterbirth+
?
FailFish
never in the console
where's that
in the log
no
nothing shows up in the console. . . .
on the plus side, running luamod losermod gives 'Success'
haha
look log again
I like Lua because if you code something wrong, it doesn't always give an error but sometimes does complete random no-sense stuff and you have no idea why.
<@266032468853915650> Entity Take Damage, myMod.render, THEN entity player? still not getting any text
so if you make a new item , it is basically useless, and you can only get it using a command
AND looked through 5 item mods from workshop (that are nearly all xD) noone managed to do it
progress: game does not crash if I actually have item 282 when I call player:UseActiveItem(282, true, true, false, false)
the problem is that I kind of wanted to use it to cheat and just duplicate another item's effect :(
also it *does* crash when I call it the second time 60 frames later :v
yea.. saw on reddit like 3 posts asking this... no answers
<@120355885615808512> so nobody has figured out that so far
the 2 last parameters are in the wrong order
lol
yea
Change your keyboard-language to US-English <@149079441908301824>
i think you did the callback wrong
<@258285593224544256> funny guy
in the placement at least
Errr... quick question, how to get the console? I have azerty keyboard so it might not be same key
https://i.gyazo.com/9a7fe2e8f053392547fdd1cf220212af.png
ok my item works, how can i add it to the item pool now
rlly bruh
its Render_Text_
oh goddamnit
I'll see later for the add of mods so
I finally got my AB+ to work with no mods
ok, can you find the render function in the docs?
well it would be but this mod aint runnin
it's ok then
alls i see is main.lua and metadata
that stop it from runnin
you could find some clandestine files
Rice, on the mod folder
boolean EntityPlayer::HasTrinket    (    TrinketType     Type    ) <@135254843567767552>
<@266032468853915650> what do u mean by disable or update on the folder
maybe the same?
I've got "if you're holding a custom item" but idk about trinkets
has anyone figured how to play sfx yet?
you can find all the entities in a room
but i can't even figure out how to test if i'm holding a custom trinket yet so first things first
yeah i'm trying to do something when something drops but that seems unlikely atm unless there's a way to list all entities in a room and then find when a new entity is added and check if that entity is what i want then change it
on the folder?
now I have to figure out why the game crashes every time I tell it to player:UseActiveItem(282, true, true, false, false)
noooo?????
Rice, do you have disable or update on the folder?
when generating the floor, when entering the next room when something drops..
still doesnt work, luamod keeps saying failed to run my mod
trinkets.. juts thought about them.. you would need like 50 more callbacks to do them..
ah wait I have 1 instead of "1" that's probably it
no idea then
yeah but it keeps putting it back every other time I load the game
you have to delete the update.it
i want to make new texture mod for characters, can  anyone help me ?
thought you just had to add "1" in the declaration
ok i get the item and the code works, but it isnt displayed
keeps marking my mod as old, how do I fix that again?
idk check the doc- oh.
¯\_(?)_/¯
IT IS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
spawn 5?id Kappa
https://i.gyazo.com/808fa9c3b245def0dab7e6d9de54ad83.png should i move pos in the function??
ITS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
giveitem <name>
what is the console command
how can i give myself an item that i have created with a mod
i thought render took its own X and Y variables but o well
guys
never used it
good to know
you have to put in vectors?
local pos = Vector(rando:randomInt(255), rando:randomInt(255))
local Vector(rando:randomInt(255), rando:randomInt(255))???
so
Vector(value1, value2)
yo dude for a vector you need to declare it
java is the pepsi of programming languages
gag
and java FeelsBadMan
yeaa c#
im used to C#, i'd prefer to have 'em
https://i.gyazo.com/fa2987253be668d8e76fb7029c40c883.png
I do the same ?
you could get rid off the semicolons, but I guess they don't do anything ?
yea
axe 'local'?
i tried luamod myMod and it said failed to load mod
make it "function myMod:render()"
no errors even
it has to DansGame
sure
an error
log doesnt show anything
i did. nothing happens
if it doesn't work check log
i'm also trying to tackle trinkets, but hastrinket takes a trinkettype enum?
seems fine try it
when i want it: 1. now
things i want: 1. my money
im trying to figure out trinkets
things I wanna now:
1. adding custom items to itempools
2. change stats
3. on item pickup callback
https://i.gyazo.com/4ddb2995740ed7da71b5ae502dc611a3.png do i have to replace some of these .s with :s?
im just asking
im not sure
who?
then you can do this:```
rngesus:RandomInt(100)
```
yo one of you posted a passive item example here right?
at the top of your lua file write this:
```
local rngesus = RNG()
```
lol
no
yes
so just... RNG(255)
<@132192021984051201> no only max
well. i guess render doesnt work
it's absurdly useful for dubugging man
blue nipple...
what do you think of this, supposed to be item for my mod
but it's the best since the invention of the wheel
yes
people would make hacky workarounds for the functions to make them work
i fucking knew this would happen
"made shit-tier dll module that opens a console and replaces the print function with one that works" -Parakeet, 2017
parakeet made it
http://cogg.rocks/uploads/isaac-ng_2017-01-04_00-34-22.png
how's RNG go is it just RNG(0, 255)
no just select mods in the main menu
so gonna play some greedier mode till someone finds out how to manipulate stats or add custom items to freaking itempools FlipThis TableHere
hmm. do i have to run a command to activate my mod?
yea
The function `Isaac.DebugString()` Let you add a string to the log file
so basically just stick the folder in the mods folder and watch the magic happen
oh
it generates one for you
got an example, <@266032468853915650> ??
autogenerated
metadata.xml
not really
do i need anything else
idk what a DS_store is
well all i have is a folder with a main.lua in it
yea if it's correctly sorted ?
from the looks of it, we stick it in a folder, shove that in the mods folder and then just run it in game?
lists all the achievements?
you could split the lua files up I think
you guys got any idea what the achivements command does in the console?
so we call our scripts main?
hard to do then
riPepperonis
haha
i wont know what the maximum is so
oh
who knows, what did your RNG code look like, i want this text on a random part of the screen
RNG you can set a max Integer
yea Random() will give you a random integer I guess??
I used RNG
it just says Random()
what is RNG for then
okay
what
<@120355885615808512> https://zatherz.eu/abplus/group___functions.html
WHERE
I can just unpack files and looks for music.xml and filename
i gotta put in a min max value, huh
where
what
the documentation just says Random()
gdi
and IDK if file names have changed
and no random won't work I think xD
Cause I had music mods that replaced Satan, Isaac, ???, Ultra Greed, and The Lamb music
thank u XBagon
OH
Question: How would one go about with music mods on Afterbirth+?
myMod:AddCallback
i hope random works
https://i.gyazo.com/02ab75700147f917bdc932b004917254.png
and how do you use them
what the hell are actiontriggers
didn't read
oh only music
Music modding is really easy.
if we could understand how to mod first ?
If anybody can help me for Antibirth OST mod : https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lzr2i/need_your_help_for_my_antibirth_ost_mod/
Thanks ! :)
<@228680372215349249> right wtf
??? whats the difference between active and passive then??
<@132192021984051201> try that ?
which is kind of stupid given Pony etc.
that doesn't make sense
OH
from what I've heard anyway
picking it up uses the same callback as using an active item
majority of isaac items are passive how does it not have its own callback
seems like such a staple to the game is all
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKEDMG, mod.onDamage, ENTITY_PLAYER) probably..
<@132192021984051201> really? i'm not considering the state of the API
eyy'm back
im surprised something like passives doesnt have its own callback
so far tbh it seems like we've got no documentation and only 1/2 to 2/3 of the api :v
in that order?
something like this yea
also, for isaac taking damage it would be MC_ENTITY_TAKEDMG, ENTITY_PLAYER, function right?
maybe 2
ill have to declare a bool
that cannot be the right way ?
ye you have to somehow save that you already got that
wont that just continously grant soul hearts when u have the item?
so... if hasCollectible, grant soul hearts, but if not... then what???
balanced
https://gfycat.com/ScholarlyGloomyIsabellineshrike
I was trying that and it isn't producing the result I expected but I'm probably just doing it wrong, I'll give it some more work
...
so you know the antibirth api, right
we interrupt this ab+ api talk for an important announcement
<@132192021984051201> jacquerel said it ? HasCollectible() is it
but how would you actually manipulate the pools or select screens or what have you
^ yes
there is Isaac.GetItemIdByName()
so you could just put flags like isXunlocked in there
is there a way to get the ID programmatically because my issue right now is that I don't know how to make it do something every update, but *only* while you are holding that item
doing an "if (player:HasCollectible(itemid)" would seem to be the natural way, but I don't know how to get the id number from code and I can't manually enter it because that will depend on mod load order
but there is a persistent data store api I found last night
<@132192021984051201> umh I found nothing in this short time... you would need to find a method that gives you all the items you currently have
which is disabled for mods
Brb going to my pc
All the old item unlocks are tied to the achievement system
Look at the xml files from the decoded assets, there is many pointers there
they strongly implied it's possible but i'm not sure
also, how would you do mod unlocks
to confirm, you can't giveitem a trinket when you've alredy got one and it doesn't appear until the console is closed, my items sprite just wasn't appearing
If you want to get the ID of your modded item, you type `g <your item name>` and it will show the associated number
it'll be an exe mod
im gonna make a mod that says 'YOU'RE A LOSER' every time you get hit
it probably won't be too long until someone manages to finagle a "re-enables unlocks" mod tbh
`luamod <mod folder name> `
Don't forget spawn 5.100.item I'd which spawns a pedestal with an item
the fact that you can't unlock any ingame content with mods active gives me kind of an existential disappointment
that's the one
well if you type "lua" there'll be three things it autocomplets to and its the one that isn't "luarun" or "luamem" :P
luamod
or wait no actually I think it wasn't luarun
the other useful command is "luarun modname" which will reload your mod so you dont have to keep restarting the game
even though that key is in the same place on both US and UK keyboard layouts
for some reason it didn't work for me until I changed my keyboard region to US
then just press `
mods must be enabled
<@154701703474577408> how do i enable/access the console?
By the way, how do you autocomplete in the debug console
<@120355885615808512> how would i do that?
if your mod works, then it will appear on an autofill list as you are typing
there's no easy setters for anything either
Jacquerel: hmmm that sucks
<@161402676637073408> open the console and type "giveitem itemname" or "g itemname"
yeah
you probably need to update and check if you have this item <@132192021984051201>
Problem is that GetTearHitParams gives you a copy of that object and not a reference
<@162115267957096448> we haven't found the functions to set *any* stats yet :v
is there a way to spawn in a modded item like hothead without trying to look for it
no idea
these are the stadard ones
```MC_NPC_UPDATE = 0, MC_POST_UPDATE = 1, MC_POST_RENDER = 2, MC_USE_ITEM = 3, 
  MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE = 4, MC_USE_CARD = 5, MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE = 6, MC_FAMILIAR_INIT = 7, 
  MC_EVALUATE_CACHE = 8, MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT = 9, MC_USE_PILL = 10, MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11 ```
I'm searching ?
really??? it's not MC_ITEMPICKUP or anything?
can anyone confirm the bility to giveitem trinkets?
<@162115267957096448> same thought
There is the function EntityPlayer::GetTearHitParams. Where is the SetTearHitParams?
LUUL
I cannot find a callback for that sadly
sweet! seems simple enough. at least in terms of making items
exactly
from what i can tell, you shove whatever you want your mod to do in a function, then tie it to a callback, which is when something happens in the game, right? like when u take damage and stuff
If I remember, there was a aguy here that said that the item gets used when it's picked up
good question what callback that would be
then on pickup only
uhm
something simple as a first try
im just trying to make an item that adds 3 soul hearts
what do you want to do?
meaning our changes would occur every frame
but update occurs every frame
some do
well it seems like actives for a callback for when they're used. do passives have a callback for when theyre picked up?
for stat changes we have no idea how to do that. for other effects whenever it triggers.. probably update
What do you mean by that?
does anyone know the callback for passive items??
Delete Isaac and reeinstall it
this fucking api is ab+s arg
tell me if you add your item to itempools Kappa
good
thanks
yeah it works
oh wait
<@120355885615808512> doesn't seem to work
<@266032468853915650> http://pastebin.com/WqGPtrpm
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN,0,position,Vector(0,0),player) <@128874748041101312>
whats the callback for passive items?
can you send me the code
yes
does anyone have a mod with Isaac:Spawn in it
if someone finds out how to add items to itempools PLS tell me ty
Get it on pastebin or something
Yeah I see it
<@120355885615808512> already got it but thanks, useful stuff. didn't realize i needed the items.xml in /content/
There's a log in it
So on the My Games folder there should be another folder for AB(
<@135254843567767552> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834035046&searchtext=
Just copy and paste what you need out of it
it worked that morning
yes
Did ab+ work before u downloaded the mod?
thanks
<@155802905671237633> Where do you run that abplus-snippets.lua from? The afterbirth folder itself?
So I tried after and It crashes
Steam has finished download
On the blog post
where can i find that pyrokinesis example mod?
You have to wait for it to unistall
DLC unchecked... still crashing
oh wait... it does work
Can somebody help with the file locations for the other platforms?
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5m092c/how_to_do_things_with_the_ab_api/
You don't on the library page in the steam client and unchecked the DLC
doesn't display errors in the log either
I can't get DebugString to work
No
the folder or from steam?
Ab+
Legion delete an+
there's a replacement print in there
Errr... cache says it's okay, but game still crash... i hate my life
https://gist.github.com/Alloyed/51d4bc67b44e91d04ced4d07fea93f36
No it does not
print doesn't print to the log
Yeah
maybe I should try to verify cache?
WTH even after deleting that folder game still crash at launch...
Then delete the entire mods folder
Not at all
Any other mods?
it already was
Folder is empty
Documments\My Games\The Binding Of Isaac Afterbirth+ mods
Nah m8 u gotta delete it on it's folder
I've tried unsubscribe from it then do it again but it still crashes LOL
Delete the mod and maybe reinstall it
Help me! After installing the MegaBrim mod from workshop to try, the game don't load, I click on play and then it crashes.
Nah there's an amount arg
Wait. Wait. It actually only adds one blue spider per function call. LOL
Wow great english
best
but then singular spider
lol
LUUL
...flies
they should've waited a few days then
http://i.imgur.com/ioFTECL.png dont you just love consistency?
Maybe some things will change when they add more mod support within the next few days like Tyrone mentioned, but as it is right now, I'm super unimpressed.
^
But like. You knew you were making this DLC to have mod support - why not make the new items adhere to that.
Right. THat's what blows my mind. I can understand the Rebirth/AB items not being coded in LUA
yea
they obviously don't care about datamining if they have an unpacker built in
the ideal solution would've been for ab+ to be coded in the lua api
Yeah. Any sort of syntax error or whatnot causes the update.it to be created. That's why not having the version number in RegisterMod creates update.it. It's not that the version number isn't there. It's that it's a general syntax error.
if you wanna make a solid api, script every single thing with this api and give this code to the users
But it seems I have a syntax error ?
well yeah but still
<@266032468853915650> it's not just the api version that causes update.it to be created
<@266032468853915650> I have the 1 there
That's the question I'm asking of a lot of things.
No, it is just the api version
why couldn't they just do that?
you know how minecraft would convert old worlds to new ones, but warn the player in doing so that it could cause bugs and incompatibilities?
why can't it just autoupdate them
it just throws update.it in there WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHAT TO UPDATE
RegisterMod("ModName",1) will stop it from creating update.it
the game doesn't even warn you
you know what pisses me off
Look in the log file in documents/binding of isaac afterbirth+
If update.it gets created when your mod is loaded, it means there's some error in your mod.
When I installed a mod, the game crashed at every load and tried to relaunch. So I'm trying to reinstall.
as expected, i just disabled it before deleting update.it and it worked so np, cheers
When I delete update.it, it recreates it as soon as my mod is loaded
but i think i get the gist
unfortunately deleting update.it makes my game crash on load
Also delete "update" and "disable" from mod folder
RequireMod("ModName", 1)
? so what's up with this [old] stuff again? i don't _think_ my game just updated, so what am I supposed to fix...
Best Docs 2017
rip
http://i.imgur.com/jVvMs7H.png tfw you try to make a MOD
And then I'll get a file to edit? Okay I'l try it out
<@149079441908301824> download an item from workshop
hi
What is up my dudes
Hello, I'm new to modding and I wanted to first of all create an item but I don't know anything about coding. Can someone tell me where I can find a sample of an item code and how to edit it please :)

Sorry for being not that knowing in modding.
and nothing of value was lost
Sorry

The Steam Community is currently unavailable. Please try again later.

whyyy
yeah, i havent added the item yet, the code runs when isaac gets damaged
hoping for some kind of answer
i tweeted at edmund about better documentation since he's answering questions on twitter right now
incredible
they have to be edited
yeah tyrone's example mods don't even work lol
nevermind
yeah
<@258285593224544256> your item doesn't show up
cause i heard tyrones earlier examples dont even work
are there no actual example mods for this btw
i will add the item for my mod now
same
imma try making some sense of this modding meem
see i *only* knew about the 30 frames per second internal game structure because of kilburn
they should've handwritten another EXPLAINING THE INTERNAL GAME LOGIC
its so ugly
two handwritten pages
looks like im browsing some obscure site from 2000
however they have like
well yeah they're doxygen
<@66197463593136128> well they were auto generated and probably made within one hour
the second line has no use yet
here is the code <@128874748041101312> just put it in the main.lua and put that into a folder
man these docs suck
cool, i'm glad *the documentation tells you that* ?
local freezer = RegisterMod("Freezer", 1)
local freezer_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName("Lucky Freezer")

function freezer:use_freezer()

    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[i]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddFreeze( EntityRef( player ), 30)
            player:AddCoins(1)
        end
    end

end

freezer:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, freezer.use_freezer, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
noone added his item to a pool yet? Damn
<@66197463593136128> yes
i want to make an item with like 4 charges and when you activate it, it freezes all enemies for one second and gives you one coin for each enemy in the room
yeah one second is 30?
i am just testing it
yeah mine works
pls halp <:isaac:257394072933761026>
wait mine works maybe
i am testing it right now
<@258285593224544256> can you like send me a zip of a mod
no prob
well ty for the information
could you test my theory? set it to 30 and see if they go to one second, i'm basing this off of antibirth's api
how do I add my Item to an itempool? I mean I cannot know the id..
i thought it was time in seconds
duration i assumed to be frames
yeah the docs only say *duration*
yeah of course the docs don't tell you that and i know of that because of kilburn
so 30 would be one second
1/30th of a second
ah ok ty
so 1 frame
you set the value to 1.0
https://puu.sh/tb1H1/22dc51ec4b.png
the game internally runs at 30 frames per second
I'll just reupload to gists
Got a reddit account I can thank?
<@66197463593136128> why does it run for 1/30 of a second
But I think it gets automatically taken down in two weeks
No problem.
<@77068961144909824> mind if I link to your script?
noone?
NEways I'm writing up a tutorial on how to get hello world running from start to finish
what
If the mod is loaded and produces an error, it will put it in the log file
they're doxygen, yeah
Yeah I'm pretty sure the docs come from doxygen
meaning it's going to run for 1/30th of a second
You can use this script with Python to display in real time the log file while running the game https://hastebin.com/rasefadake.py
you set to 1.0
AddFreeze's syntax is ```Entity::AddFreeze    (    EntityRef     Source,
integer     Duration 
)        
```
and why are all the new items 0.5 and all the old one 1
uhm what is "DecreaseBy" in the itempools.xml?
Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+\log.txt
this doesnt freeze any enemies
yeah it's the same place rebirth and afterbirth logs were
entities[i]:AddFreeze(EntityRef(player), 1.0)
does somebody know why
in the afterbirth+ folder, next to the folder where you put your mods
where's the log?
that doesn't look like lua to me
http://i.imgur.com/V5eejRI.png
why does my code not work
c++ syntax all over the place
entities[i]:AddFreeze(EntityRef(player), 1.0)
to the log.txt
you know the stranger part is that the documentation looks like it's for c++
¯\_(?)_/¯
log
and errors
where does print output to
we just need better docs
and no idea how to import items into the itempooleditor
but i am not sure
probably content
not sure where to put itempools.xml now
yeah
because I have both, content with items.xml and resource with gfx
and resource is the lua
content is i belive the resources folder
the content has the item xml and the resource the sprite
my mod works now
what's the difference between the content and the resource folder in a mod folder?
or tear effects?
anyone found out how to edit stats yet?
There is probably more issues with it though
sorry, but thx for help
forgot that
oh right
GetPlayer needs an argument
it doesnt work
i copied that from the hothead mod
local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( )
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            player:AddCoins(1)
        end
    end
compiler error
and putting update.it in the folder
why does AB+ keep saying my mod is [OLD]
how? ?
have to add it to itempool
I just thought about my mod.. The D2 cannot even spawn LUUL
btw, is there already a file so you can add autocomplete to your editor
<@148602144747028480> oh ok ty
there we go, enough work for today, bunch of ideas for tomorrow
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834433846
<@258285593224544256> There is a xml in Hothead, it shows at a line "active". To make a passive item, change it to passive. Pretty obvious ?
<@!194259969359478784> uhhhh. nice. ty!
yeah you can't even fucking change stats
i think theres something to check if the player has a collectible
i have only seen items that can be activated and have charges
how can i make an item that has a passiv effect
what a great api
not possible apparently
how do you make a simple tears up? ?
I made a very small python script that displays the log in real time in the command prompt
?
it fucking sucks
uh
it's bad
oh, oh, the api sucks
sing it with me
how cann i make an item that has a passiv effect
does anyone already have an idea how to make your items an unlock?
best mod ever
ITS OUT http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834429323 PogChamp
sombody any idea why enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() not works
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage", 1)

function happyDamage:getCoin()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local enemy = player:GetLastDamageSource()
        if enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy.Entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
eheh
okay, got a tool for you guys:
```Lua
local eLog = {"Log:"}
function mod:eLogDraw()
    for i,j in ipairs(eLog) do
        Isaac.RenderText(j,50,i*15,255,255,255,255)
    end
end
function eLogWrite(str)
    table.insert(eLog,str)
    if #eLog > 10 then
        table.remove(eLog,1)
    end
end
mod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_RENDER, mod.eLogDraw);
```
call `eLogWrite("test")` for an onscreen log!!!
the new unpacker
it works perfectly fine
it doesn't overwrite it
ok
LOL LET'S MAKE IT INVISIBLE
BUT INVISIBLE
it was at the same place
found it tho
LUUL
ok fuck me i'm on mac
documents/my games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods
i would like to copy past the player.xml file there to try stuffs
stupid question but where is the "mod" folder
like I wanna have all "Bomb" Items
I wonder if there*s a way of getting items by their name
IT WORKS
YES
should be possible
wait.. I juts could initiate the rng thing at the start of the lua file like the registermod.. right?
I'll try developing some "real" mod later today. Passive Item that alters tears... Let's see how this goes
i wanted to make a simple mod that would be useful but the modding tools aren't capable of doing it in 2 different ways
cool thx
Yep
MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT ?
WORST
this is worst than i thought
<@120355885615808512> it's the POST_INIT one
what the fuck
ty
ah MOD callbacks
<@!194259969359478784> no, sadly not solved yet. But I was sleeping inbetween
<@120355885615808512> in the luadoc
ModCallbacks in the docs
where is a list of all the callbacks? ?
solved?
<@!194259969359478784> I had that same problem yesterday
what is the callback for start of the game?
doesn't work
using hothead code but for a different item
okay. Why the fuck can i add a callback for a new item but not for an existing item?
sure
uhm.. right rng.. give alwaysa the same numbers ofc.. do I need to create the rng thing before I use my item now?
<@109624258317033472> can i dm you?
or is the mod without scripts?
<@174630956567756802> nop, just the metadata.xml which created automaticly when running the mod once, same folder with the lua
<@258285593224544256> Did you try that IDE I messaged you?
<@109624258317033472> after this, i choose a zip?
i have tried, but havent found any that have that
if it works, pokemon mod tonight!! ?
nice ?
in the files
kay found it!
upload tool? metadata.xml? oh god what's this xD
with the upload tool. just choose the metadata.xml
there don't seem to be a lot of scripting mods yet.
okay how do i upload a mod on steam?
<@258285593224544256> Still the same problem huh? ^^Dunno. I guess its a bug where lua confuses the class Entity and the var Entity you are trying to access. Just a guess tho. Have you tried looking at other mods in the workshop?
looks like shit now
it doesn't put it in a new folder
oh
EntityRef.Entity doesnt seem to work
how can i cast an EntityRef to an Entity
ooh wait it works
for me
doesn't even work at all
i actually sucks
Has anyone gotten PlaySound to work?
okay
lets caaalm down and relax .__.
i'll try now
that's weird
TRY IT YOURSELF
IT EXTRACTS ALL OF THE .A AT THE SAME TIME
hum
YOU LITERALLY CAN'T
that's all
just extract it after
well
it extracts all of them at the same time
i suppose you tried extract them after you extract rebirth
whats not working?
it doesn't work properly if it doesn't extract afterbirth/afterbirth plus files correctly over rebirth
RenderText worked for me
just extract them anywhere else
that doesn't work either
i dont know then <@120355885615808512> :/ you could always use RenderText tho
it works prperly
it's an unpacker, it's expected to *work properly*
and why the hell would you do that
well exept if you extract them in different folders
and you'll have old versions of sprites and animations
so you won't have afterbirth and afterbirthp rooms for example
god would it have killed them to give ONE example
(i'm talking to bouh)
that doesn*t appear anywhere
rebirth .a files take priority over afterbirth ones
no?
no
? DebugString()
Isaac::DebugString     (     string      str    )
yea I'm working on the rng stuff right now
how ?
there's a 'random' function in the docs as well
atleast, thats written somewhere in the docs
but you can ouput to the debug console
havent palyed with RNG stuff yet
<@109624258317033472> do you have any ideas for rng or how to output stuff ?
because it's official and you hate official things ?
works as intendet, doesnt it?
why so ?
except it sucks
yeah
does the "resource extractor" does basicly what rick's unpacker where doing ?
I'm going to take a look at all these lua stuffs
nah
things are pretty hard i see
what does DebugString()?
ok
how do I output to the log?
yes you have to create an rng with RNG()
man fuck this, ill return when there is some sane documentation lol
which confuses me
tru
yeah i thought so but the log told me its expecting an argument
shrug
<@122924009527574530> isnt that a bit weird to use since there is a RNG class?
no, you are casting a Entity to EntityNPC type
does ToNPC take an argument now? what? i dont get this doc. its drivin me insane
math.random()
attempt to call a nil value (method 'RandomInt')
wait do I have to create a RNG object first?
now, how to add costumes? this Config::Item baffles me ?
you are welcome
well thank you
https://github.com/olafurw/the-hiding-of-isaac/blob/master/main.lua#L116
RenderText("String" .. tostring(myinteger))
and if you want to concat you do
tostring(yourinteger)
but i got really rusty
used to write lots of lua with love2d
yeah i'm having the same problem
it's lua. soo WHO KNOWS?
probably
dunno. Im not really familar with Lua
doesnt that cast it to a string?
i tried it with "" + int
<@197289251568746496> first argument is a string. I dont think you can simply Render an int
pardon me
Okay it doesnt
<@120355885615808512> lemme test
wondering how to make an instance of this Config::Item
How do you add a costume to isaac?
I cannot see anything
it doesn't xD
no idea if it will work, but i dont see why not
or something simmilar
Isaac.RenderText(RNG:RandomInt(1), 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 255)
where ?
print RandomInt(1) for a few times
0 or 1
RNG:RandomInt(max) starts from what?
haha
thanks
this is lua
oh curly brackets
íf you're mod is old it's probably because there was a error compiling
oh update.it
My mod is old?..
nice
how do you like my arts Kappa
so nobody knows how you can get the Entity of an EntityRef, so you can call AddBurn on it?
np ^^
ty
yep
I guess
without c?
.c111?
and then use .[variant] to specify
theres an ID for Item pedestrals
dunno
console
sorry
nono
local game = Game()
game:Spawn(something check the docs)
Game:Spawn(....)
how do I spawn item pedestals?
maybe the workshop ones are better for reference - they might even work
Hothead is a sample mod, i saw two popping up on the workshop already heh
enemy is an EntityRef but i need the Entity to call IsVulnerableEnemy() any idea how to fix it
gives that error
attempt to index a nil value
enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy()
my mod just have musics and reskin, if someone know how to port, please contact me by dm on discord, i will probably type his name in the "thanks" section"
need to start breaking things into files
refresh now, I just pushed latest
ill have to test it before, but, be ready for the newest version of the binding of pokemon!!!
EntityRef.Entity doesnt seem to work
does somebody know how i can get the Entity of an EntityRef
yeah you can port mods directly but i don't know if the resources thing would work
https://github.com/olafurw/the-hiding-of-isaac
its not like thor is even active anymore so ima just gonna upload it
<@122924009527574530> what's your mod? ?
I resorted to just moving a bunch of the script stuff into the mod itself so it would behave
my mod has been marked old 3 times tonight
yo boiiis can we just upload mods directly to the workshop? i can easily port the pokemon mod!!!
the API is going to be in increadible flux for the next few weeks, so prepare for your things to break every few hours
and call functions when tehy do
there are room and flood id's, you can store them and check changes
*floor
Nor for leaving an old for.
I already made one for new room
I'm probably just gonna program a callback for myself
no
<@122924009527574530> Is there no Event for starting a new floor?
a bit
is the documentation up to date then?
its for refference
API has changed since
and they don't work
didnt expect that
thanks
ohh
<@197289251568746496> they can be downloaded from platinumgod
sliide on another website
but if I call it like 10 times to make sure the game is initalized it works
if I call it only once in update it doesnt work
I found the mod folder but no sign of sample mods. seriously where are they hidden?
seems very finicky
olafurw: I think because curses are not per-game but per-floor. MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT should only fire once at the start of the game
Why can't I AddCurse in ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT but have to call it again and again in ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE ?
<@162115267957096448> no
additionally the sample mod for antibirth is a very good example and is more intracite than anything tyrone ever showed
<@258285593224544256> have you managed to output the enemy table?
antibirth has barebones documentation as well but it's consise and clear to follow and you know what everything does just by looking at it
I think the sample mods worked at some point in time, but they probably made some last minute API Changes
so EntityRef.Entity doesnt seem to work
truly terrible
oh it's terrible
i have been looking at the documentation but its aweful
they didn't even fucking test their sample mods
Where can i find the sample mods!?
that angers me
like
If you know some Programming you can look at the sample mods and try to get them to work ?
or you wait for antibirth lua like any sane person
yeah this is the correct answer
Or you can just make a graphical mod by editing sprites.
Or if you don't know Lua, you can look at a tutorial.
You wait until there's better documentation.
How do i get started with ab+ modding?
Will have to try that when I get home
i dont know either
If I just print something from the mod to stdout, will it land in the log.txt?
and i need an entity to call AddBurn and IsVulnerableEnemy
<@!95444500364660736> but GetLastDamageSource returns an EntityRef
when I want to remove a coin is coin:Remove() correct?
<@258285593224544256> Shouldn't it be just ```lua
        if enemy:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end
```
?
ok
you could output enemy to the log to see whats in there
function arguments expected near ':'
i tried right now but it then said:
did you try enemy:Entity? I always forget when to use the colon
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage", 1)

function happyDamage:getCoin()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local enemy = player:GetLastDamageSource()
        if enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy.Entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
thanks
https://zatherz.eu/abplus/class_entity_ref.html
Is there an online mirror for the luadocs?
so enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() is wrong
attempt to index a nil value (field 'Entity')
i get an error
ty
if enemy.Entity:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy.Entity:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end
oooh cool
<@120355885615808512> debug 8
or maybe, even more concisely, has anyone actually managed to add a new mechanic or use an existing mechanic in an interesting way?
can I give me infinite charges in the console?
has there been enough progress solving stuff for people to give a relative thumbs up or thumbs down for the amount of content we could reasonably create with the current mod tools?
i didnt try it, but so it says in the docs
so enemy.Entity:AddBurn() ?
.Entity
like i have the EntityRef enemy, but i want to call AddBurn on it
how can i get the entity of an entityref
and why does toNPC return nil!? i dont get it. Not that i really need that sound, but its bugging me that its not working
nicalis, you never fail to amaze me
well that's dumb
yeah ok. But thats the ONLY way to play sounds, no global play sound whatsoever
because that npc's playing the sound if i had to guess
Why is PlaySound even in EntityNPC. That doesnt even make sense
6660 is a custom sound
Mods/lottery/main.lua:35: attempt to call a nil value (method 'toNPC')
yea np
does anyone know why this doesnt work? player:toNPC().PlaySound(6660,1,0,false,0)
oh wow. Thanks ?
it is in the The Binding Of Isaac Afterbirth+ folder
in the log.txt
How do you know where you get an error? I was looking for that yesterday
worked but now i get an error at enemy:IsVulnerableEnemy()
ok, i will try
(Colon instead of period)
shouldn't it be player:GetLastDamageSource()
any idea what's wrong with my  code
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage", 1)

function happyDamage:getCoin()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local enemy = player.GetLastDamageSource()
        if enemy:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
``function arguments expected near '=='``
not sure why
```if coins[i]:Type == ENTITY_PICKUP and coins[i]:Variant == PICKUP_COIN then```
this line is wrong
learned something
old = error
yea
Hmm, there is some interesting files in the <isaac Directory>/resources/scripts folder. Probably useful for adding autocompletion capability to an editor
oO weird
I have exactly this ?
and then delete the update.it file
you have to cahnge RegisterMod( "Name"); to RegisterMod( "Name",1 );
aaaand it's old..
I can remove the metadata
The debugger seems to keep wanting stuff like EntityType:ENTITY_TEAR to be a function
wait
the "old" things is very annoying
what is the newest version?
would be awesome
maybe theres a plugin that uses the doygen documentation to do that. dunno
i wish i knew how to use autocomplete
oh yea
thx
bye
does one of you know how to use autocomplete, how I can input the isaac stuff into vs code?
bye ^^
no i mean that i have to use an NPC to play sounds is impractical
im off to school, gl everyone
what do you mean
that just sounds not very practical
because the other time they wrote entityType too
if coins[i]:Type == 5 and coins[i]:Variant == 20 then
Is there any way to play a sound without using an NPC?
okay.. just thought it woudln't be an integer..
(20)
PickupVariant.PICKUP_COIN

"Variant"
ye I did
couldn't find something at least
look at the entity class reference
tried to cast it to pickup but pickup has nothing to identify a coin
but how do I go deeper
5 is that
gotta check against ENTITY_PICKUP and so on
that's the question
I know
do you use ":" for attributes in lua?
not just coins
i mean that'll apply to any pickup
could use the words yea
there are all the things
the enums.lua
and its coins[i]:Type
where are you getting 5 from
it's called "collectible" in the code
<@109624258317033472> could you help me with this? I need to find all coins in the room and I cannot find an function nor attribute to identify a pickup as coin. I have this:
```local coins = Isaac.GetRoomEntities()
    for i = 1, #coins do
        if coins[i].Type == 5 then
           
        end
```
Hmm, tjhat spawns a familiar
Oh, it's spawn 3.[item ID]
someone said earlier, it's like a dictonary without definitions
cause I know some programming, but jesus is this documentation impenetrable
ty
and found it out anyways
I assume so, Faux
yea
oh
they are labeled Pennys not coins. that might help
i wanna say thats it
are people going to add some better documentation notes to the auto-generated file?
<@120355885615808512> 5.100.<item id>
yea cannot find coins tho
its surprisinglly not gridspawn
probably with Spawn
i dont know how tho
ahhh no. Also possible in console
so I have to execute lua?
<@105465854551937024>  So something like this: 

for i = 1, #entities do
    if entities[ i ]:Type == EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR
<@120355885615808512> Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE,0,position,Vector(0,0),player)
but the guy can hardly speak correctly (video tutorials)
A few small tuts are on r/moddingofisaac
yeah I found a few tutorials
can you spawn item pedestals with the console?
have any modding tutorials popped up yet? just like the basics of how to set up a new mod, what you need to put in the folder, etc etc?
You can loop through all of the entities and check it's type against EntityType.ENTITY_TEAR
I can't figure out how to check if an entity is a tear, and it's annoying.
uhhh
ah thats fine
Not an item, sorry, an entity.
Cause I'm pretty sure that there should be tears in there, considering its in the list of entity types.
so like an item? ie: number 1
An object in the container returned by GetRoomEntities
large amounts of emphasis on "try" btw
what do you mean "an item" markus
<@170163213919453184> go right ahead
I'm still having a heck of a time trying to check if an item is a tear
idk about the [old] thing
ok right uh I didn't realise I had to be smart for this so uhhhhhh I could try?
<@170163213919453184> I want to know if 2 by 1, 1 by 2, and 2 by 2 crawlspaces even work, and if so, where Isaac spawns in them
wait I cannot activate old mods? so old is really a problem?
The game's log
if there are syntax errors in my lua code, would I see that somewhere?
i would test but isaac isn't launching since teh new update :3c
you'd have to use teh room editor for different sized crawlspaces
I could test something sure what do you need me to do ?
I currently cant test
Could someone here try testing differently sized crawlspaces?
oh okay
that's what I meant. the steam mod uploader does that. It's only important for steam things not functionality
didn't know it auto generated
oh okay I see now
I used the example from platinumgod.co.uk to help structure the mod
its automatically generated atleast
you don't need one
ah there is an update lol
wait, I didn't even know I needed a manifest.xml
oh did they change it
the steam uploader should solve this if you're finished
let me get a screenshot
on the mod screen
where does it say old lol
yes you can
the manifest.xml isn*t right
oh so I can't activate it yet
because you have to upload it first I think
wait why does it say [OLD] after my mod
best thing you can do is to get mods from the workshop and just look at the code
thank you
oh wait no thats not my comment thats my thread lol
hello thats me
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lw9u2/creating_a_basic_callback/dbzd1hi/
mods menu in isaac
I made a mod main.lua like the mod example from Platinumgod.co.uk, how do I load this mod ingame
probably should write that on reddit
wow
"ä" english layout
lol I wonder what'sup with that
"ö" german layout dafuq
no idea which key though
I DID IT
and pressing all keys on my keyboard german and english layout
the mod is activated, I can see it
for real I'm exactly doing what is written.. and nothing happens
man, maybe it doesn't work because it is a modifier key?
"`" this one?
one is "old" but that shouldn't matter
I did
Maybe you didn't enable mods yet
Doesn't work when you hit the button located on top of the tab key?
doesn't work
xD
right
thats the key
?
``
hm I cannot open the console
I have a swiss French keyboard, but in the console it works like a US keyboard. Is it different for you?
cannot even change my keyboard to english xD
To exit the console you hit enter with an empty command line, that took me a while to figure out
rip these
and ß
And experiment a bit with the special keys
and ä ü ö
It is confusing, but you just have ot swap y and z :P
I don't think this key is on my german keyboard xD
can you change the key?
ty though
yea I'm reading that atm
In the /r/themoddingofIsaac you can find useful threads
You need to enable mods, and then in-game press the keyboard key that is on the top left of your keyboard (under escape)
Has anyone figured out how i remove the [old] tag from my mods?
How do I import my mod into the game? I have the file, how do I put it in
how can I debug? where can I find the console? and how do I output someting? ?
my idea was to do ToPickup() and then look which pickup it is but that seems to not work
I'm trying to figure out tear collision right now.
I think that's subtype, but I'm not sure.
cannot find a way to get the pickup variant though
only looked at functions, that was the fault
It's one of the public attributes I think: "const EntityType Type"
What was it?
ah I think I found it
from my entity
how do I get these integers
yea okay I found that
Coins are 5.20
I found the enums
what do you mean
<@120355885615808512> I think you can tell from spawning stuff
and so does going through a curse room door
gj
... taking hp up kills you
entity flag maybe? but with no proper documentation I have no idea which int for coins stands
someone knows how I can check an entity if it's a coin?
oh shit thats a small image
sprites
i still have some of the sprties
... o...kay?  stepping on a sacrifice thing still instakills for no apparent reason
for autocomplete
how do I get all the functions into visual studio code for the lua stuff?
actual health needs to be tracked elsewhere, but...
doesn't render hearts, but doesn't die in a single hit
So... the lost?
this is SUPER HACKY but I managed to force a character that doesn't render hearts <3
OH MAN
i actually tried to do hush floor once i only did few sprites and then i got bored lol
a hush floor that sounds cool
it draws UNDER the HUD...
:(
thanks again
yeah
Knowing how you fucked up is the first step to being a good programmer.
The log files are important because they help tell you how specifically you fucked up.
I got a good program, just didn't know if isaac was just .lua files or what
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lwgx5/fixing_hothead_finding_the_log_file/
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ is good to use

oh okay, thank you
Here are some other helpful links:
Then you try and imitate the stuff written there.
Ideally you get something that can open several files in tabs, and can open the stuff found here:  http://platinumgod.co.uk/AB+_sample_mods.zip
sorry new to modding isaac
You could literally just use like anything that can edit a .lua though.
just copy files and edit those?
ZeroBraneStudio. It was the first osx lua editor that showed up on a google search.
just a guess
possibly
notepad++ probably
<@266141401824100362> sorry, but you're the only coder I can find, could you tell me how you're coding for it. Like what program you're using.
what's this "offset rgb"
so uh
...huh.
First step in the slow, kinda silly process of reworking synergies is donezo.
HasCollectable wants the item number.
FUCKEN GOTEM
<@164110030671446016> if you need some help with mods, i could probably help you with sprites and whatnot
Think that might be wanting an item number, but the lua guide says it wants a CollectibleType
Just started digging through error logs, looks like hascollectable wants a number
in here
whats happenin
There may be something in here that can help
https://zatherz.eu/abplus/
<@266141401824100362> found the link
anyone else besides pancakes, pope, and sapper that is apart of the project?
i dont see why not
its dead and can easily be reused
sure
should we use mine?
PM me the discord link once it's made thanks
it has a whole bunch of syntax for isaac
When I can
Also <@266141401824100362> I have a link that may be able to help let me find it
it's been dead for ages
Yay!   Basic hush room backdrop edits comin' up
You could come to my discord
i can probably use it for that
i have this old modding discord thing
yeah, deffinately
If you do, could you add me too?  That'd be pretty great.
<@164110030671446016> maybe we should make a private discord for people willing to help so it'd be easier to store ideas
I've been trying  HasCollectible and it hasn't panned out.
Has anyone figured out how to check whether you have a given passive item?
tell me what you need and i'll try my best
or PM me
If you guys need spriting help and some stage, @ me
thank you
holy shit pope desu, you would be a great person to have for the project
I'm willing to do the textures for all the room sizes once I can get back to a computer
If you need anyone to help program, I've used lua for awhile now, so once I learn the new syntax for AB I should be good to go
no joke
1000+
Hush flies ane gapers do already exist, so we've already got some thinsg to work with
Some rooms?  How many rooms does a floor need
I'll do some decals maybe?
Blue Boil, Blue Gaper, and Blue Conjoined-Fatty are all enemies that should appear
Hush FLOOOOOOOR
ill try to redesign some ideas for reskinned enemies
hush floor project a-go
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/wiki/index
So should I just get all the programs that the subreddit wiki reccomends for modding, or just some of them?
I was about to say that I see it now so yeah probably a delay
yea just a delay
Is there a delay or something?
It's not showing up on the workshop page
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834259118
it should be enabled by default
or is it enabled by default?
do I need to change a file for debug menu?
no but like really
no actually nicalis hates you, they are just too afraid to say it, so they released a dlc instead
the game just hates me
I have mods
ok i'm literally smashing my ~ key but it's doing nothing
put them there
Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\
or would I just have to put it to the workshop
how would I enable my OWN mod?
go to the steam workshop and install one with the subscribe button
in the mod menu to enable them
and hit ~
I have a lot of questions
enable a mod
how do you install mods
how do you enable mods
how do you even bring up the debug menu
What is the command to spawn an item on a pedestal
u fuckin better
~~https://puu.sh/taMh4/411c1dabd4.png~~

I'm off to sleep, if anyone wants to they can add me on steam
it doesnt have enough space
sorry zeta, the game overloaded after the final boss's animation
because nicalis
... okay, why can't I make this work x.x
What a small world
Holy shit I helped ur friend make that
my friend made a mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834232778
Here is the file I'm trying to get it to load
```lua
local function Update(self)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0);
  local S = player:GetSprite()
  S:Render(Vector(player.Position.X, player.Position.Y), Vector(0, 0), Vector(1000, 1000))
end
```
Can anyone else try to get the game to load an edited animation file?
what exactly is your code there?
I guess?
anyways, that's a sprite rendering
oh well
that other guy got a video preview

where do I start with this
ok right
nope
it's not a xml edit I'll try though
... huh. I actually have *half a red heart container*
that's the only way i got changes in items.xml to take
Either that, or replace resources with content
to get a SIMPLE SPRITE RENDERING
why is it THIS HARD

I pressed both of them and It didn't work and I feel daft
Is it not possible to just do this to edit the animation of an item?
question I have no idea what the hell I'm doing
ok
'`' or '~'
use tilde
yo what's the button to open the debug menu?
but it never worked for me
but it retains state
supposedly "luamod modfoldername" works
you can reload a mod using luamod <modname>
if it's enabled it's enabled
also is there a command to reload the mod files without restarting
You don't have to load anything special in the debug menu to test the mod do you?
oh wait there was that dll file thing right
is this crashing ;n;
why
entity:GetSprite()
<@228680372215349249> I just noticed you can get sprites from entities that presumably work
in AB+
like real question how do I do the do
ok guys right how do I do things
Kapp
they made it with minions
so they're LoL devs
weird
It looks like you can only PlaySound on an npc
wow
ok so now antibirth just crashes on startup
says "attempt to call nil value"
does playsound not exist
wtf
iunno
and POST_RENDER works with rendertext too
... returns false
`print("rendering: ", spr:IsOverlayPlaying("test"))`
found it
POST_RENDER might be a problem if there's a finalization step
MC_POST_RENDER
That's the only way I got rendertext to work
Where are the mods stored?
<@228680372215349249> is it in an update loop?
that's odd
o my gift refund didnt' go through
*why*
it just... won't actually render anything
_headdesks repeatedly_
I miss greenisaac
yea just saw doc now
which of course didn't work for the first few hours ._.
oh any mod
Any mod will do, the docs suggest just using a workshop mod
no but like legit though how do I make an item
Antibirth is gonna be ported tho
what is the mod to put inthe folder?
steam support *does* exist
but you have to use a us keyboard layout because hegemony
how 2 make item 4 dummies
@steward You first have to install a mod into a OS-specific folder, and then once you activate it from the ingame mod menu you can use tilde
ok just installed the tools and stuff
I have it loading without crashing
hmm. currently prodding at Sprite
O shit its stewart
PagChomp
It was refunded
PagChomp
Well how do I bring up the debug menu thing at least
Yeaaa
because they gave a horrible launch to us
i mean thats the only thing thats gonna work now
you can politely ask nicalis for documentation ?
AB+
Hey does anyone know how to alter a costume to read different costume files?
:rallC:
i mean, if it doesn't. I guess I bought one of them a cheeseburger or something and got a dlc that might improve in the future
i don't believe in it
i did but
shame on me for trying to use the modding tools i guess
might try it anyways
o
i was too
I haven't touched the room editor at all
so i'm probably committed at this point
i'm already past 2 hours
tfw you just know steam's gonna decline your refund
I think they showed up for me when I ran the resource extractor
and they showed up at around the same time, so i guess they're some sort of temp file
it put my instapreview.xml there too
oooh, they're probably from the room editor
dunno, but their names look like hashes
they're all varying <1mb file sizes
yeah i was wondering the same
it just takes you to the head directory of the lua docs
what are all these gibberish files in the rebirth root dir?
oh ty
in luafiles
/tools/LuaDocs/index.html
wheres the index file
i think i would be able to add new pill colors !
it's more easy if you open the indx.html file
oh i uderstand a bit more
yeah
wut
and this was just like
but i've done a few tiny minecraft mods and some stuff
i would by no means consider myself a truly compentent programmer
idon't understand a thing !
wow
it especially doesnt help when theres not a single hint given on how to work them
the programs all work, but they're a bit stubborn and confusing
probably not even all of those either
there's just enough to start feeling one's way around things
sheaaat
We basically only have function signatures
the "documentation" we have is autogenerated
essentially yeah
not yet
so there's no documentation ?
close enough though
ah
it was Nicalis
ik
edmund didn't make the tools
HAVE FUN
HERES RANDOM TOOLS EVEN THO HALF OF THEM ARE MISSING
which seems right
Isaac.GetPlayer(0):getTearHitParams(1, 1, 1).TearDamage returns 3.5 for me
edmunds like
so basically
even stuff that looks like it would work doesn't
did they ship the wrong api
for me
it loaded but just did nothing
ah right
yeah
no, the GetTearDamage( ) and stuff
oh
no like.. the stuff in teh API
it caused my mod to not load
i couldn't either
you mean missing hud?
but that might've been me
I couldn't even get the getters for stats to work
well, what can we do
i just wanted to make a simple damage up item and i cant even do that <:isaac:257394072933761026>
that'd be neat
but i guess that's a pipe dream
would put a huge hamper on your stats when you picked it up (active item) but count the # of enemies you killed. when you activated the item it would break and you'd get your stats back and a stats+ based on the kills you accrued
i couldn't find anything and i read through everything in the documentation
I had an idea for a cool item called "Test" (literally just named it that to test an item) taglined "test your limits".
i tried for a while
so there really isn't?
i'm trying really hard to be patient but i don't really think it's gonna pay off
they had better add this shit in soon
so there's literally no way to modify stats aside from heart containers
damn
<@155802905671237633> it's been out for 12 hours but it's been in development for ages. i'm not really ready to wait them out
so modifying TearParams has no effect
it has a render function but you have to load it with an animation it looks like
There's a sprite class
Do anything? Maybe but we need to figure it out ourselves
and not just text
draw a *sprite* on the screen
... is there a way to just, uhh
yeah
at least afaik, i'm not that experienced with lua
some of the stuff it refers to is unaccessable without further information
but it feels like the documentation doesn't cover everything in it
i mean, obviously
the api feels like there's stuff missing
anything is
idk where the fuck
i would imagine anyways
so you can increase damage there
yeah good luck
TearParams has TearDamage as a public member variable
im just trying to add a simple damage up item
it's kind of like flash back when macromedia owned it
which also powers activated items
basically what I want to do is give him/it (golem) a health *bar*
o nice
might do a write-up on it tomorrow
this character I'm trying to add
i figured out the animation editor somehow
so
yeah
Yes
on how to add shit
no hints
they give you
however
its pretty easy if you know how to use the previous version
took me a good 30 minutes
good luck figuring out the room editor by yourself!
also the documentation has NOTHING to do with the tools
Yeah this is p much how afterbirth modding was made through a bunch of teamwork and the devs encoding stuff in custom file types
There's not much to read, it lists the function names and little else
Not like they are super great anyway but it's a bit of help
Have you tried reading the docs?
ehh
give it some time
It's been out for less than 12 hours
nobodys made a tutorial yet?
i'm not sure nicalis does
at least, most of us don't
we dont' know
ok dont help me then
yeah, I'm noticing a lack of mutation functions
apparently there's no way to actually get a non-const entity out of this x.X
oh
If you want to talk about titys, go to basement.
does anyone know how to add items in ab+
lewd
"const Entity"
welp
oh.
...
fast? that was super slow, you must think that because your mod is shit
Wow, that was fast.
So isaac can stand from 70, 150 to 560, 410, and axes are y is down, x is right
it's okay

GOOD IDEAS
tint everything green and release binding of greenisaac
tint everything green and release binding of greenisaac
it is bruh
it is bruh
Green Cain isn't even up, you liar.
and the animation editor doesnt even work so.....
yea i cant even finish my super simple item because theres no way for me to trigger an animation
Except for Mega Brimstone
<@266032468853915650> green familiars or ban Keepo
?
All the mods so far are either ports of old mods or sample mods.
protip: it won't
How will my mod ever compete?
OH YES
Oh no.
all the colors of the rainbow
GREEN CAIN IS UP BOIS
lol
np
thanks
well that sucks
yeah, any mods
Do graphical mods affect achievements as well?
they do
Does anyone know if mods disable achievements or not?
but i have a lot more faith in kilburn to make a better one to be quite frank lol
but still, a functioning ab+ api for the time being would at least be nice
wow ?
had a mental confusion moment
yeah i had it right
if that's what i have to wait for then that's good enough for me
my sentiments exactly
err
lmao
Kapp
and put the good stuff from AB+/AB into it
Just have to wait until the Antibirth API comes out
i still want to mess around, i have modding ideas, if i have to wait for antibirth api to put them into practice then fine i'll do that
but i guess it'd be something, i really am into modding anything i can get my hands on
yeah, it won't be the same either way
same
it honestly doesn't even matter if it gets better for me right now, it's been spoiled
it just won't restore my faith in nicalis
i really hope they can fix it honestly
yeah
and maybe it gets better but right now this is just a mess o.o
yeah
by some people at least
i just hate that he's gonna b elike... blamed for all of this
because damn what a let down
i'm glad to hear that.
and he only realy worked to desighn some of the little bits and bobs of filler content that came with AB+
he designs things for the game but he's not responsible for programming it
ya i do rember reading somwhere that he doesnt have much to do with AB+
yeah
and family
he's moving on to other games now
he's working on that other project
yeah
it sounds like he doesn't have much time for BoI anyway
based on that roundtable podcast he was on
yeah i don't reallyb lame him
also lmao
honestly if anything i don't blame edmund so much as i do nicalis
Nuclear throne simulator: ``` Game():shakeScreen(99999)```
where did it all go wrong
why brudmund
now i know what it feels like to be a starwars fan when the prequels came out
yep
circlejerking it off at Nicalis  HQ
as in find the object type?
pass it into something taking a Vector
oh hey, a way to tell what the derp an unknown userdata is
either that or tyrone is just a really bad coder
probably not coding much
what the fuck were they doing for a year to give us this
Yeah kilburns half working API is nearly better already
maybe by some miracle tyrone will have a sudden coding spree to make this API great but very very doubtful
yea id love to see this game with moddabiility on par with garrysmod
and he's got the access to the engine deep enough to do it
dude has worked with gmod and lua for years - i'd say he knows what it takes
well i mean kilburn can definitely make a better API there's no doubt in my mind
which is probably going to happen
I'm going to find it really sad if Kilburn can make a better API than the developers themselves
could you link me?
than this one
Yeah NYS
might as well wait for that one then since it'll most likely be a hundred times better
sag drew it
It's his fursona.
i want to find the source and know what artist drew it
<@123641250879504384> where did you get that image?
omg
Yes.
does kilburn have his own API in the works?
lmao
same bites
The only good things are the new challenges.
I LOVE THIS PICTURE
honestly
OMG

The new enemies suck.
The two new final bosses are jokes.
the ingame content, the mod tools and documentation
because everything about this dlc release has felt INCOMPLETE - as if they're really going to make us pay to finish their DLC for them
green isaac pls
I doubt any good content will be in next month's "booster pack" because we don't have enough time.
those are the parameters sent to MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
where's the documentation in the unpacked resources?
how do you make custom ones
So that we could plan.
dont animations have triggerable events in them?
This information should have been posted before the DLC even came out.
Why is Tyrone waiting a week before posting about the modding tools?
`[INFO] - Lua Debug: table: 11740568    userdata: 11737548    1.0    0    userdata: 11737570    30`
is it tho
this is science time
i made a few animations for my familiar but since i can't even get it to work in-game, what's the point rn
hmm.
ok
There is documentation in the unpacked resources, but it sucks.
please do xD
if nicalis doesn't make documentation for it, then i will :V
i'm getting the hang of it
if the animation editor wasn't shit
This is just lazy.
At least create an animation.
it weks
YESA
why
isaac has eaten vegetables
it can't
Steven can beat Green Isaac in a fight anyday.
folder*
<@!182509747835109387> try deliting update and disble from the mod folser
does it just flat out not work
how do you even use the animation editor
oh
<@266032468853915650> When I downloaded MegaBrim, it said [OLD] next to it.
It was uploaded even before the workshop was up
I'd download it but literally any mod could have a trojan in it
Why is Green Isaac the second most popular mod?
does MegaBrim work for you guys?
or blah = Vector(3,5)
das lua mane
it exists
lol
just that
Vector(3,5)
hmm. how do you instantiate a Vector
ooh bois just fixed the megabrim mod
fancy
wow neat
<@155802905671237633> If you put it like this:
\`\`\`lua
-- code here
\`\`\`
 it'll even have syntax highlighting.
ssh
cool, that's a pure lua replacement for print
Can discord do code blocks? ```lua
local function print(...)
    local s, sep = "", ""
    for i=1, select('#', ...) do
        s = s .. sep .. tostring(select(i, ...)) sep = '\t'
    end
    return Isaac.DebugString(s)
end```
absolutely
we all know best mod is green isaac
If you guys want to download the best mod on the workshop right now, here's the link:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834187918
<@173380286183112705> you still around?
Isaac.DebugString() is the logging function
Just so everyone knows
LuaDocs/namespace_isaac.html
where the derp is the Isaac table documented
Binding of Steven is being uploaded.
did you enable --luadebug?
i was having trouble just getting the mod to reload properly when i changed it
hmm. Anyone else having issues when trying to use the mobdebug.lua script?
made shit-tier dll module that opens a console and replaces the print function with one that works
and that shit inside LuaDoc
tyrone you have failed us for not giving a terminal
we all need it.
now
it
i need
share the secret.
oshit
how
wowoww
i did it boys http://cogg.rocks/uploads/isaac-ng_2017-01-04_00-34-22.png
documentation, more like sssshhhmmmmocumentation
where
documentation
The documentation is dumb.
well, obviously so i guess
i wonder if there are functions that the documentation doesn't cover
don't think so
hmm. any idea if there's a way to force-hide the hp meter without a curse indication?
lma0
ow0wo0wo0wo0wo
WOWOWOW
and then of course the general public doesn't HAVE the code, so whoops
2 and a half of those hours were waiting for the luadocs to generate
it's probably been in a state of "the code is the documentation" forever
that's why they delayed it
they spent 3 hours on it
This better work.
Okay, I updated all the xmls.
because there's no way they spent a year working on it and this is the result
dick move if that's it
i wonder if they actually have a much better version of the mod API and stuff done and they just chose not to ship it for some reason
i thought about doing that but yeah you'd only be allowed to have one mod's characters at a time ):
editing the anm2 files?
how do i stop this annoying fridge alarm sound whenever i increase item charge through setactivecharge
like I know how you can proooobably fix it but it's kind of stupid and only one mod at a time can add characters :(
maybe that'll come in the upcoming "updates"
yeah
...the select screen, however, doesn't quite get there
my character works fine now
since you can add items and characters (kind of but not really) through them now
they could have locked him behind Aprils Fool <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121>
they probably had to change the xmls for the sake of modding
does kind of strike me as odd that Apollyon is unlocked from the start *shrug*
did they release an update to AB+ that adds that?
"actual game"
I don't like it.
The new players.xml is formatted differently.
this is probably a case of "oh crap we're late, sprint on the actual game and we can put out docs after the fact"
And items.xml.
Oh, I probably need to update players.xml.
to be fair, starbound still has documentation issues
So it should work.
I just overlayed the changes I made.
I did.
Are the images indexed color? try saving them in 32 bit (RGBA)
and same mapping
you sure they have same res
But the game still crashes.
So I changed the menu sprites to the new ones.
I have a mod I made for Afterbirth.
what is it? was away for awhile
Can someone please help me?
i'm having too much fun with megabrim
own thank you
you are beautiful
I love your mods
I fixed both menus, but it still crashed.
my mods are bombing
i'm back
Get the mod "Really Bad Gas" from steam workshop for pill sample code
Does anyone know how `MC_USE_PILL` callback works? I tried both versions (below), neither of them worked.
```lua
pillpack:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_PILL, pillpack.pill_used )
pillpack:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_PILL, pillpack.pill_used, pillId )
```
fuck this I give up ffor now
still nothing
just tried it
that's the Fat Question
is there a way to get isaac's position on the screen itself though
since it increases moving to the right of a large room despite isaac being centered in camera (for the most part)
yes, i believe isaac's position is relative to the room
there are probably different scales
so some funky business is going to have to be done if i want to, maybe, draw text or an image over a player (is it possible to draw an image?)
noted
and the text was drawing FURTHER than the player, as if multiplied by some unknown value
so, isaac uses lua 5.3 instead of luajit
also fun fact - i tried drawing text at the player's x and y using the player entity's position var
Yup. What Elven Princess just said
I think I might see your issue
<@173380286183112705> Shouldn't the last line be ```lua
BLL_the_Invincible.NPCUpdate, EntityType.ENTITY_BABY_LONG_LEGS);
```
?
Wait
fuck this shit
nope, 100, 100 sstill didn't do anything
Oh, this image is the problem.
<@173380286183112705>, it adds update.it when it errors out somewhere
ooohhh hhaha
also stop adding update.t you piece of shit
It's the 0 right over Move
LOL
i.. can't even see it
So. Yeah. Doesn't appear to be pixels.
I have my text set to 100, 100 and here's where it spawns
LOOOOOOOOOOL
would be cool if the docs mentioned ~~these are pixels~~ **anything**
would be cool if the docs mentioned these are pixels
you're setting the x and y to 0.5 pixels from 0,0
and it does nothing, as fucking always
`Isaac.RenderText(npc.State, 0.5, 0.5, 255, 255, 255, 255);` should render some debug info when a baby long legs s in the room
anything, that's the problem
Whats it not doing, redspah?
why don't you work you piece of fuking shit
```require("mobdebug").start()

local BLL_the_Invincible = RegisterMod("Baby Long Legs the Invincible", 1);

function BLL_the_Invincible:NPCUpdate(npc)
    Isaac.RenderText(npc.State, 0.5, 0.5, 255, 255, 255, 255);
end
    
    
BLL_the_Invincible:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.NPCUpdate, BLL_the_Invincible.NPCUpdate, ENTITY_TYPE.BABY_LONG_LEGS);```

<@185090294881058816> ms paint
Yeah it was total false advertising lmao
Guys. Editing sprites. Which tool do I use.
How come my mod works with AB but not AB+? What did they change?
if you think that this wasn't worth what you spent and that you want to send a message that it isn't acceptable for them to put out something like this and claim we can "make our own game" with it
Doubtful
will I ever play it?
package.loadlib works
just to have that piece of history
so on the remote code execution front
Im keeping my copy
or even more so if you feel you have a valid reason
remember boys.. if you have less than 2 hours since buying the DLC you can refund.
ROFL
Man tyrone better add the other 2/3rds of the api this week!
I've asked the same question about three times and i still havent gotten an answer...
All the API documentation was there, but our exporter had /bugs/
Oh, the mod stuff is already there. It's just a bug!
and the fucking odcs
all teh *bugs*
what about
"adding new features"
For fucks' sake.
Of course.
Timegated just like everything else they've ever done LUL
RegisterMod("modname", 1)
delete update.it and disable.it
https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/816540034895462400
Why won't my mod work with AB+? What did they change that causes it to crash?
Which tool do i use to edit sprites, like for familiars?
that works on tables only, not userdata
to do foreach you'd normally do for i, value in ipairs(my_table) do
does lua have foreach or something to that effecy
just set them to math.sin or something to find out
or something else entirely
something tyrone manifested out of his anus
uv
pixels
X and Y coords in RenderText are what exactly
I was going to replace Lil Brimstone's model with Smol Nozomi (http://img04.deviantart.net/d1df/i/2016/238/b/a/smol_nozomi__hd_remastered__by_magic277-dabo1c2.png) as a sort of test, but I don't know how to edit sprites/models. Help?
sup?
Guys, help?

Hey guys. I was going to replace Lil Brimstone's model with Smol Nozomi (http://img04.deviantart.net/d1df/i/2016/238/b/a/smol_nozomi__hd_remastered__by_magic277-dabo1c2.png) as a sort of test, but I don't know how to edit sprites/models. Help?
just add a second argument thats just the number 1 to your registermod shit
found a way to make your mod young again
you can run luamod in debug
or do you have to restart the game
does the mod refresh if you hold r
so it uses brimstone in the direction you are facing once every update?
why not 5 times?
fuck me just noticed the error
you can use type(the_thing) to find out what it actually is
OK GUYS  i uploaded my new mod "MegaBrim"
they don't exist in lua but they're like #define in c++ i believe
enums don't exist in lua
yes
<@155802905671237633> does an enum like npc.state implicitly convert to int?
where do I check if there are any errors
so apparently adding a character just breaks the select screen's animation file :(
Have anyone used `MC_USE_PILL`? Am I doning something wrong here? ```lua
pillpack:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_PILL, pillpack.pill_used )
```
"why bother giving ppl documentation lol"
anyone know how to get an entityref from an entity?
nevermind, it isnt really lua specific tbh
...welp
go for it
mind answering a question real quick?
this is a "wtf are these docs" thing tho
I write a lot of lua so feel free to ping me with language questions
>when you try programming lua eventhough you're a c programmer
and then it's probably gonna get called "old" so make sure you delete update.it and disable.it in your mod folder
RegisterMod("MegaBrimstone",0)
It's the future, tyrone changed the API
i have all the resources and contents setup right
local megaBrim = RegisterMod("MegaBrimstone");
local    megaBrim_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Mega Brimstone" )

function megaBrim:shoot( )
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:FireBrimstone(player:GetHeadDirection())
end

megaBrim:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE, megaBrim.shoot, megaBrim_item);
guys any idea why this don't work?
like a lua state reference or something
ref is probably C++ only
oh. there we go
RegisterMod has some shit table argument that doesn't seem to be used at all
there's no avoiding it
we all get old some day
seriously, how to make your mod not old
where do they need to go
...okay, this isn't picking up my images at all
wow already got m3m3s
>he hasn't made his isaac green yet
lmaoing @ ur life
oops
there were two example mods in an old blog post and neither of them actually work until you tweak them slightly
there is Isacc::GetItemIdByName
how do i make my mod not old
so in the docs
wait, example mods? where?
all of the builtins use manual ids
or can you only use ID (which is auto-assigned)
is there even a proper way to add your item to the item pool
I still find it hard to believe that there doesn't seem to be anywhere in here to modify stats.
haha oops
press tilde with mods enabled
for some reason I had to set my keyboard to english(US) even though english(UK) has tilde  in exactly the same place
`
hit tilde
after you've added a mod and enabled it ingame
we need to make sure that isaac grows up big and strong
how 2 open console
people like green
43    Current Subscribers
Hah.
i've been editing a diferent version of this file for like 5 minutes im an idiot
Wait so right now is there a way to edit stats?
OH i actually didnt <@132604813731954688>
unzip it, drag and drop in users/documents/my games/afterbirth+ mods
ah I found it
where exactly do you put it
it's one of the example mdos
yeah
is pooping monstro a mod?
https://gfycat.com/JealousTepidAkitainu there we go, black heart mods continue
and what do you mean, swifttiger?
i did indeed, shawn
there'll be a folder
or, something like that
you want to put it in documents/my games/binding of isaac mods
<@209476116862337027> did you change your RegisterMod function to have an apiversion number in it?
<@209476116862337027> so if I wanted pooping monstro I just put the folder in the root of isaac?
How do I make a call back when I pick up an item
my mod has no errors and is still creating update.it
<@132604813731954688>
2 in the morning here
memes
EH
why would you kill all the enemies lmao
So, yeah. If your mod has any errors when it attempts to be run, Isaac creates an update.it file in the mod folder again
swifttiger, basically your mod will be the root folder of isaac
well ok then
i dont think thats what he means
<@128874748041101312>
I just want to see what the folder structure's like
okay how exactly do you make and install mods now
someone give me a shitty mod they made
COLLECTIBLE_ ?
how do I make a mod callback for an item I made
Ah. Actually. I think if there's some sort of error in the mod, it creates the update.it file
Yeah. Mine actually just got marked as old while still in game.
but it still gets marked as old whenever you exit the game
putting 0 as verison number works
cause that might want to be in there
So is there any particular place where the community is going to upload docs
lol yup alloyed you were right. just adding 0 as an argument to the end of registermod works
cities skylines in particular
I know other workshop games allowed native binaries
So you can just upload exes to the steam workshop? apparently someone just uploaded the antibirth folder to the workshop
Or in this case, too lazy to write any documentation at all
and it'd probably suck
because I'd be too lazy to write good documentation
this is like watching if I was a game developer and I released an API
0 works as a version number
lol
What a clusterfuck this is
can we all just pretend afterbirth+ never happened and hail antibirth as the actual sequel please
lmao
<:whipper:259939519061688320>
maybe we need to feature request edmund for an api version global so we can actually create mods
Maybe we have to solve an ARG to get the api version
but what's the api version?
so registermod needs an apiversion param now
someone dld it
oh shit
so that's one mystery solved
the TearParams class controls TearDamage and a few other things about tears
??
xd my mod is the 3rd most subbed
where exactly does a root look relative to the mod's folder
...okay uh
Ehh, whatever. im going to sleep know, 7 AM, its time. Cya!
i think that's probably doable
good
in this case a custom bob's rotten head does seem possible assuming you can keep the item holding animation from stopping rather than just playing for a split second
lol
all of what we need
but not really.. uhh
these functions are NICE
<@266032468853915650> Thats old buddy
const Vector &     GetAimDirection ()
const Vector &     GetLastDirection ()
ah
Direction     GetMovementDirection ()
 
Direction     GetFireDirection ()
 
Direction     GetHeadDirection ()
hopefully a better documentation can at least point us in the right direction, but i'm getting a bit doubtful at this point
class_entity_player
GREEN ISAAC BOIS
yeah
how do you get current aim direction? I was trying to find that
Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed with the state of things so far.
OH SHIT WHAT
but that seems so extraordinarily subpar
The Steam Workshop is up!
you're able to get things like the current aim direction or last aimed / last moved direction
I can't believe they'd do shit like that after saying "make your own game"
as far as I'm aware there's no way to make your own bob's head or anything like that
if that's true then that massively outrageously diminishes modding capability
nope
I've heard that you can't intercept key presses or input
lol
i was spoiled so heavily by the gmod wiki's extremely thorough documentation and search bar
The CacheFlag enum has all the stat types listed, and the EntityPlayer class has an AddCacheFlags method.
Yeah
kil's die command is Kill()
maybe the same approach would work
in that case antibirth API's tear functionality is probably on par with this API
however we can do really hacky effects
no tear effects
Antibirth api is super barebones
Not really
The only thing I've found even remotely close to having something to do with all the different stats is the CacheFlag enum.
Antibirth's API probably has better tear functionality from what I've seen
so simple and beautiful
Yeah. There are getters for all the stats, but no way to set them.
that's what I'm wondering
honestly how is this only marginally better than Antibirth's shit api
you can GET the firerate
not tears themselves but the tears stat
I've spent an hour looking through the documentation and can't find a damn thing on modifying stats
i have yet to find a way to change tears
i'd laugh so hard
how did he screw that up
ha i'd laugh if you can't even modify stats
wow
really that's all the update adds on the mods
Has anyone figured out how to modify stats yet?
TYROOOOOONE
but the docs don't tell what this supposed number should be
[INFO] - ERR: resources/scripts/main.lua:22: bad argument #3 to 'RegisterMod' (number expected, got nil)
still [old] and wont work
didnthelp
tryed that
damnit
just delete that and you're good to go
okay so updating just adds a 0byte file called update.it
not significantly
wait, did they update the docs just now?
So I'm assuming mods made before Afterbirth+ still need to be unpacked the same way as before, despite the inclusion of the mod settings in the main menu?
anyone knows how to change that?
All of my mods are [old] now
bbs
I like the bmfont format, but most of the editors are pretty bad
gonna go test my theory
k
cool
oh neat, it uses bmfont stuff
a lot of the docs files changed
yeah 8 mb
wait did it update
Can I just make a folder in the mods folder and throw the files in there now?
D: my devconsole wont open
How do old mods work (such as audio mods from moddingofisaac)?
So
rip GreenIsaac
now my mods are marked as old
wow
lets hope it doesnt break my ?
ok fine ill update
i dont even have afterbirth installed

lol. It actually did
i dont even have ab+ installed
why does it wanna update
anyone knows if it is possible to activate an card effect?
did afterbirth+ just stealth update
would make sense, havent tested it tho
wat
has anyboy tested what the AddBurn 120 and 1.0 parameters are? Are they frame lenght and damage multiplication?
I think the devs need to flip a switch on their steam dashboard or something
I think the devs need to flip a switch on their steam dashboard or something
just that
I have nothing
in any workshop folder
you get that on my workshop files or in the greenisaac mod?
yea the next step is to make it a sword instead of a ring and have it damage enemies
That dodge roll is absurdly big
^

Oh hell ye
but I doubt you can make any interesting characters though
is slot 573

starts with half a heart and is otherwise isaac
add new ones
yeah
like
but can we *add them*
i'm assuming we can
yeah
that's technically my own character
that was one of the first confirmed things

at all
can we make our own characters
it's looking for assets related to the character *only in the mod*
I see
oh
ab+ everyone
http://puu.sh/tavVn/440df365d3.png well that's a start I guess
...
im shooting 1 brimstone every tick!
Easiest thing to do is to make a folder in the mods folder and enable it
Ahh, I see!
religion of peace
its FireBrimstone
but
its like the bible
Yeah already creating a Quran
hmm. is there a way to disable parts of the HUD?
Is that CreateLaser or whatever, Kyo?
yeah
but first you gotta find the mod folder and install something there
np
or ~
ty
if you have a mod enabled, it's the ` key
i might have overdone it
Sorry quick question  how do i open the console
it kills any enemy faster than you can say it's name
OpieOP
its actually 5 tho
omg

i dont regret a thing
nought to three
fun trivia
Item ID 1 is sad onion
I'll try that, thanks
Ah
for picking them up
or whatever
I think its for the PREEFFECT
So, would MC_USE_ITEM also work when a non-spacebar item is picked up?
Oooh, super helpful to know actually..
in code, spawn entitytype.entity_pickup, pickup variant collectible
kyo, in debug console spawn 5.100.itemnumber or just 5.100
So how would you access them programmatically
But you don't specify ids
it would probably give them two different ids
eyy how do you spawn an item pedestal?
probably
Can you have two items with the same name?
no more advanced patching like Starbound has?
something like that
pretty simple
There aren't any conflicts, they're just added to the list of items
idk magic
...how are xml conflicts resolved anyway
has anyone figured out how to get the current tear type?
probably is if you added your own characters.xml to the content folder of ur mod
Has anyone figured out if adding a new character is possible in AB+?
well, AB+ will always have the advantage of the Steam-Workshop
cbf
and then he'll build a bunker out of the subsequent 500 bricks he'll be shitting and hide in it forever
wait nvm they sold cave story original for money
yea tyrone will shit a brick
Atleast, it seems like it will
When it does come out though, should I feel bad for Nicalis since it'll be superior to AB+
kinda cool
but thank you!
how cool is that?!
wait, Antibirth will have an open API?
just check the frame count
if you sleep you're making the whole game wait until your function is done sleeping
wouldve been better that way
I've only used the Antibirth API  @Scayze but if it's any similar you spawn an item pedestal with a random subtype
uhm there was some rngpickup thing someone mentioned earlier
shouldve gotten kilburn to just import the entire gmod lua api to isaac
yea i dont think this api has sleep
is there a fast way to spawn an random pickup?
australia's great my girlfriend's from there
make an item that just stops the game completely when you pick it up
Wait the API doesn't even have sleep?
that warrants an australia
smh
pls freeze the entire game it's better this way
or just skip it i think
how do i add a delay to my code that doesnt freeze the entire game
or you can send `nil`
just make sure you check if it's a vulnerable entity in the callback
oh
Also, you can set the entity_type parameter to -1 if you want it to apply to everything i know
live ur own life
idk m8
and presumably as a mod
but I only want it to work if an entity gets hit by isaac's tears
not confirmed
via mods or waht
so whats edmund talking about with "bringing antibirth into the base game" or whatever
just because it lets you know the entity that hurt you doesn't mean you have to use it
Travoos... just get all entities separately
oh my GOd
w HAT
you just have to restart the run in Antibirth
cool
first complaint is that the take damage callback requires you to specify a specific entity to work with (what if I want it to apply to all enemies?), there's not enough callbacks in general, Entity_Tear is literally said to exist but IT'S NOT IN THE API
i think its your file name
this takes way too much energy
luamod <name>
you can do luamod in console
honestly i'm so done for today
Will I need to open and close to make a change?
So when do mods get reloaded?
Same
It's convient for users though, I suppose
Not a fan of the scripts and shit being in My Games
i won't because linux :c
I just found the mod folder
That's scary
honestly if the modding API does not get updates I'm just gonna trash it and wait for antibirth's API
hot
that's the worst thing i read all day
it's still WIP
that's all it is right now lol it has no input, just that
WHAT
omg
looks nice ._.
jer
godbless
that's the console
even with proper text colour parsing
http://i.imgur.com/xb0bYFL.png
I'm starting to think the API in general is bad
Antibirth to the rescue...
y-yes
You guys think the console is bad?
I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make something happen when isaac hits an enemy
p weird
Charge is consumed after the USE_ITEM callback, not before ?
Idea: make a lik 999 charge item, and then add an effect that charges it fully
I had to do this, so don't feel bad. http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/dch85j.png
Probably gonna have to do it a weird way
Or am I gonna have to do this a weirder way
Is there a way to stop a spacebar item from filling up on room complete?
It's not that it's hard, it's that it would be so easy to add the more convenient options that it's almost painful
it's not a pain but it's going to take me a bit to get used to it :(
It still sends your current command
It's not that much of a pain to press enter.
its kinda cool
And you can't hold backspace
just by posting the pic tho
I like that you can't close it with tilde either
I can't believe I died.
the worst part about the console is the second delay before you can use it
You asked.
thanks for the spoilers ?
Blultra Bleed
Ultra Greedier
whos that guy
yeah the console is kinda hot garb

doom's console at 320x200 looks nicer
so do you guys think it's possilble to fix most of the flaws with mods or are we gonna have to rely on kilburn to do it
god that console's fucking hideous
they're-- they're ants
nice
that's great
ayy i can spawn particles now! sweet http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/87kjsi.gif
I would've liked it better if it was exactly like the daily challenge
but it's also confusing and weird
I thought it was pretty funny
crap**
wow, this challenge is kinda rap
which is double bloat
yea pancakes except for mom
now use the seed C0CK FGHT so they're all charmed and have to fight each other
so like, is the boss of Aprils Fool Always bloat?
splendid meme
This is true Bloat Mode.
bbbbllllooooaaaatttt
I think I might edit the sprite because it goes behind the charge bar

Stewart did teh sprite for it, by the way ?
I think you can spawn particles the same way as any other entity, just spawn an entity with type effect and variant some particle type
Maybe
just an idea
maybe it could be usable at any charge but it does less explosions the less charge?
hm...
makes a circular explosion at the cost of 2 bombs + 6 charges
ahhh so the effect thing was sprinkles
donut bomb
is that a donut with a cord sticking out
night night
love you too
aAAAAH
i fuckin love you
Sorry.
yea i wish edmund used all that money to hire a small third world country that makes mods for you
Aah, I see
BLESS YOUR SOUR PHORT http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/zr13y1.png
Game is not a namespace or a global, you have to call Game() to get one
Whats this LUA crap? Where's my 'make mod' button?
no, probably Game:ShowFortune() or Game.ShowFortune()
I think it would just be 
Game():ShowFortune()
there cannot be enough
not enough succubi
no
Did I spawn too many succubi?
i keep asking but this is my last resort lol
does anyone have an idea how to call those
you're playing it wrong
give me the controller
chub dislikes smoke
Can't make a mod without it :^)
see!!!!
Seems like it has some super useful methods
no one knows?
so game class
ah cool i like how the little slot for the description is still there http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/hk53nd.png
MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE
i'll give it a look, thanks
I believe it's post peffect update
what's the callback for when the player gets an item?
discord keeps making the sound of isaac getting mauled by a gaper, how do i turn it off? ........................*scrolls up* oh it's that video from earlier
Awh, thanks! I want to make it spawn little sprinkles as well, but I still gotta find out how to spawn/make particles
better than mine haha
that's a pretty friggin cool Nommiin
Maybe the entity that is taking damage?
As for the parameter it needs, no idea
yeah I just typed it weird in discord for some reason
Yeah, it is DMG
I heard it was MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
or is that still a mystery
so has anyone figured out how to make a callback for MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE while I was doing other things
Here is my current item, by the way.
http://i.nommiin.xyz/i/bc5s7r.mp4
i'm back
ah, missed that was even there, thanks
In the items.xml change the active at the start of the line to a passive
Hi there, I have a problem with the instapreview in the room editor. I put in the .exe of isaac but it won't start, is there something else I need to choose?
I'm still trying to figure out how to make items that aren't activated
it's a shame that they only provided two examples and one didn't even work without debugging
It's the ones that aren't that suck
Most of the functions are self explanatory
It's not terribly hard to understand
i hope one day we can get documentation like the gmod wiki's
I guess I'll wait for tutorials from more experienced individuals to come out first then.
the console sorta sucks
Yeah, that's what he said
yea its like a dictionary without definitions
it's the documentation that sucks
modding API is fine
meh
Is it that bad?
I just asked my brother how the modding API is and he just laughed and laughed
i think i can figure it out nvm
o wait
how would i go about doing that
you can change the EntityCollisionClass to disable collisions with monsters, bullets, etc
is there a way to disable isaacs collision with shit
hopefully won't be too hard to make
i'm gonna try to make my item idea from here https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5jir65/item_idea_homeopathy/
just need to figure out how to do invincibility frames
Not bad!
made a shittier how 2 jump http://streamable.com/6ee7c
I also really want to use "SpawnParticles" but it never works.
A lowercase p indicates that you want to spawn in a pill
Use an uppercase P instead of a lowercase p
interesting, thank you for your help. i was trying to add on to the id's by starting at 52 <@186331772412231681>
well... every time i try to spawn in my familiar, it just spawns a bad gas pill instead
Because I'm at a loss
But last call, anyone know how to call these functions? https://zatherz.eu/abplus/class_game.html#a84ec33d7ac1ab5a3b1b55a494032ec3d
Yeah, the api seems pretty good
Just so damn lazy, I'm shocked by it. But then again, it's Nicalis
the api itself is pretty good imo but the documentation, not so much :V
I'm sure it'd be like 95% better with... proper documentation
oh yea also since im new i have to check, what do we think about the api
do you think my item's a bit too powerful
But uhh yeah, any idea? Because I'm shit at lua.
And it will be the same number you use to give yourself the card using "giveitem kNN" where NN is some high card number
no yeah i know
I can't really post a link to my local copy lol
Only shared it because it's the online version
>>>zatherz.eu
may god have mercy on us all
I thought about hardcoding the explosions by checking the items but then I realized: "Wow, that's a fucking awful idea"
<@209476116862337027> no, if you do a debug string to print Isaac.GetCardIdByName("My Card 2") you'll see that the number you get back is a unique id
hothead has an items.xml, and i think the main resources folder also has one
Also, I'm proud of myself https://streamable.com/bpzu5
hm interesting thought
Also uhh... how do you call these functions? https://zatherz.eu/abplus/class_game.html
prob just extend the item pool bit
Also, I'm very curious in the question Nommiin has.
i'm assuming you can just make a file in your mod that extends existing pools
btw has anyone figured out how to add items to item pools?
So, anyone have an idea how to create explosions based on the character's bomb explosions?
have we shown that it works with all of the xmls yet, btw?
:V
I wonder how the merging works with the xml files?
oh fuck no wonder this mod isn't working, i didn't even enable it
<@186331772412231681> does this sample you posted overwrite the first two cards tho?
Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_DUKE,0,0,Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.Position, 10),player)
i thought you were going to say the one about the chocolate bunnies
he he
oh
i was just going to say the documentation
what
<@109624258317033472> can you paste the line of code for spawn
nope <#207259602969034753>
wanna hear a joke?
hey guys
[INFO] - [Lottery] Error in PostUseItem call: ...Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/lottery/main.lua:20: bad argument #6 to 'Spawn' (Entity expected, got table)
leaving it out, ot putting the player in wont do
uhrg. Isaac.Spawn just wont work ? i have no clue what to put as "Spawner" param.
works
Add pickup code into Player's On NPC Update
shit why is my game crashing now
which is good enough for me
Even if it's not a "true pickup" in the code, I should be able to make a ghetto pickup
?
phort you wouldn't happen to be a disguised member of nicalis would you?
's what im doing
that
yep
player i believe should just be a single entry version of players.xml that goes in yourmodfolder/content
i'm going to need help xD
working on adding player
true
but
tbf familiars are like directly supported
i'm attempting to make a familiar right now
it should be
So let's do this shit
I think yes
time to figure out if it's actually possible to add consumables
Here's some sample code for a card
well, it seems like it'll do i mean
but it's good
I mean not *enough*
the api itself seems extensive enough yeah
the documentation is just a looping webm of tyrone licking egg's asshole
The docs are the problem
kinda
the API's alright
nah mate we can work it out
ok, so i'm doing all sorts of math in my head on adding pickup items
rip ab+
even transit seems to have lost hope regarding this API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^
Yet? You say that like they'll add something
seriously????????
seriously
>no room clear callback yet
Does getting your current direction of movement return a vector?
There's no room clear callback yet
Can't wait for Antibirth+!
moves right and down slightly
Thanks!
gg
welp the documentation is shite too
Add speed to your character: player.Velocity = player.Velocity + Vector(2, 1)
Yup
I skimmed through it, isn't it basically just a list of all the functions with no explanations whatsoever
Fuck me I wish linux got the anm2 editor
and *basically* nonexistent
it's just shite
The documentation is out
So we don't know what we're doing until Nicalis releases the documentation?
or do i have to be hacky
<@186331772412231681> do you know if there's a room clear callback?
Okay! So, thing. You should be able to add custom pickups by adding them to entities2.xml and some finnicky shit
You seem to know things,  <@186331772412231681>. Is there a way to add speed to your character in a direction specified? I don't even have my computer right now, but I'm still plotting ?
for instance after picking up an item
MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE I believe is called when your stats are recalculated
nice
lel
i don't even have the game open tbh
I don't even know how to use Isaac.Spawn correctly
fuck if i know pissy
and add an effect with whatever callback makes any goddamn sense in this world
then local card=Isaac.GetCardIdByName(blah)
bomb explosions are a type of effect
ah, thanks, this is part of what i was missing <@96016391173332992>
<@96016391173332992> How do I spawn an enemy at Isaac's position?
yeah you'd add it to pocketitems
then i guess there's a callback to tie in somewhere somehow
erm, just make pocketitems.xml and add them
sorry for asking twice, but does anyone know how to make custom tarot cards?
would it really have killed them to document even a goddamn third of this
ugh
yo so there's not an entity bomb other than bombdrop? Are exploding bombs variants i guess?
just working my way down the old messages, sorry if something's been answered
gridspawn is only for gridentities like rocks, poops, spikes, trapdoors

Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.position, 10) 
Position should be capitalized

Does anyone know how I would manage to iterate only the bombs in the room?
GetRoomEntities, then iterate over all room entities and check if entities[i].Type == EntityType.ENTITY_BOMB

It seems that the ToBomb equivalent of ToNPC, ToEffect, etc is missing
ok ty
<@258285593224544256> An entity ref is a reference that contains some quick info about the entity (position, isCharmed etc)
but that'd be good to know too
not the bomb
by that i mean the code
will do. ^^
Try leaving it out and see if it explodes
idk
probably the entity that "made" that spawn? like isaac drops a bomb he's the spawner??
good q
uh
Hopefully
anyone knows what the last argument of Isaac.Spawn is?
Presumably with Isaac.Spawn, <@72413153614368768>
I feel like you can do a one thread anti-notify sorta thing
can somebody explain to me the difference between an entity and an entityRef
let me dig around
erm, probably?
I can't seem to figure out if that's actually possible
Turn off notifications?
Is there any way to create an EntityBomb?
it notifies me every goddamn
i'm gonna flip my shit
how?
ok people stop fucking posting in the mod request thread
clearing a room
ok
yeah
YOU DON'T SAY
god  fucking hell, the docs are horribl documented
lol
I love it when programs literally crash because I try to rename a folder in their explorer
particle oh probs
idk
or pill effect
ok!
Pill effect?
particle effect update!
i thought it said perfect
i copy pasted that
back up
also wait
every frame?
also what the fuck does `MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE` mean
There's a Room:SpawnClearAward()
I was wondering that as well, bob, earlier
~~linux nerd~~
i'm using vim like the coolest kid
nope
Does Visual Studio have Lua?
Well, I was talking a flask item where you pick up 'nips' of alcohol that fill it with different effects :p
I'm also using notepad++
Using VSCode
is there a clear room callback?
I'm using notepad++
what do you mean? like, a special drop for specific enemys?
What are you guys using to make the mods?
Just a simple text editor?
mm, Scayze? As in modding in drop items?
I wonder if it'd be possible to hackily create "drops" with pocketitems
That's my code
anyone tried?
https://hastebin.com/dutexikeza.lua
<@96016391173332992> that was posted on reddit, drops an special item for the isaac boss
adding characters
So that's odd, I have it working to only detect bombs, but it's still not letting me use ExplosionDamage
Can you add speed to your player in a specific direction?
local DropLeftHand = RegisterMod("DropLeftHand");

function DropLeftHand:NPCUpdate(npc)
  local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
  if npc.Variant == 0 and npc.State == NpcState.STATE_UNIQUE_DEATH and player:GetTrinket(0) == TrinketType.TRINKET_LEFT_HAND then
    local pos = player.Position
    player:DropTrinket(pos,true)
  end
end
DropLeftHand:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_NPC_UPDATE, DropLeftHand.NPCUpdate, EntityType.ENTITY_ISAAC);
I guess it could be done hackily
Okay so I doubt anyone's got this kinda stuff going on yet, but custom drops? It ties into an active item i had an idea for
i think itd be less of a hassle if it was just a subsection of the gamepedia
noope
to further document the API
so has anybody started working on a wiki yet
ok ty
that's just a variable holding the entity
oman got it to work
like not even a function
<@258285593224544256> local entity = EntityRef.Entity?
it's literally just inside the EntityRef
EntityRef.Entity, <@258285593224544256>
Out of curiosity, has anyone else been printing out to console for code debugging? Because you can do that. At least on linux.
guys i may be completely retarded but how can i make an EntityRef to an Entity
same for after
if it does the effect before than its before
with some dumb effect
then test it
long enough to be noticable
Just put a wait command
Is EntityNPC an enemy?
cause i need to run code right before and right after it executes...
no clue bob
experiment and see
hell
wait hm
anyone have any idea?
Yeah, corresponding to the subtypes
That just returns an integer
check... Entity.SubType maybe?
There's no way we can use os commands right?
Oh, nvm, don't even need the EntityRef
i could do EntityRef(Entity).EntityType, couldn't I?
so if we added a MC_USE_ITEM callback for an existing item then would it run before or after the item code ran?
i think i figured it out
oh man
So how could I spawn an enemy where Isaac is in a mod?
but its annoying as hell and makes a beeping noise every tick
so i figured out how to do a timed charge
Cause there's not a function for specifically finding bombentities
I cant believe I had to make my own fucking icons for the room editor
I think I need the bombentity to figure out whether or not it's a bombentity
Oh, so I can do that while running the game but I can't save it to a mod?
Right? You don't need the bombentity for that
Already using that.
What
finn that's not a mod that's the console
Isaac.Explode ?
A substitute for a wait commend?
So kinda have multiple explosions in a single explosion
So if I typed "spawn mega maw", where would mega maw spawn?
<@258285593224544256> you might want to check the docs https://zatherz.eu/abplus/class_entity_ref.html
I'm attempting to make it so that bombs explode as they're getting ready to explode
okay, I feel like I'm going about this the wrong way
you're trying to make bombs explode and, like, be destroyed when they explode, right?
well, a table ;p
I know, I'm iterating through it.
Is there any way to spawn an enemy at a specific point?
<@72413153614368768>  GetRoomEntities should return an array
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local enemy = player.GetLastDamageSource()
        if enemy:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end
<@266032468853915650> so how would i have to  change this
I can't think of any other explanation to why I can't use the EntityBomb specific attributes, though.
idk what to tell you
I know, it's odd.
that's not how inheritance works
it's not like EntityBombs are hiding Entities inside them
hm, that doesn't really.. make sense
the Entity is an attribute of the EntityRef <@258285593224544256>
So I can't use the EntityBomb specific attributes or functions
I see no other options
Can I make a timer based off of game updates to charge my active item after a certain about of time?
Cause it's odd, if I do GetRoomEntities() it seems to only give me an Entity, even if it's an EntityBomb
<@266032468853915650> how can i make that to an entity
mm, what're you doing now?
Does anyone know how I would manage to iterate only the bombs in the room?
but it's clunky
that makes sense
oh!
<@258285593224544256> GetLastDamageSource returns an EntityRef, not an Entity
the disable.it file is there when the mod is disabled
well, 2 pizzas. 2 extra large pizzas :s
thought so, but no grid type is PEDESTRAL or something
what is this disable.it file?
i got a pizza
ehm, is item pedestal spawn and not gridspawn? apologies if that's clear already
ughh. i cant get an item pedestral to spawn.
Im using:
local position = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(player.position, 10)    Isaac.Spawn(EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP,PickupVariant.PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE,10,position,0,player.SpawnerType)
if that's what you're talking about
so just get a random number in the range
true
to be fair the enums just represent ints
I want to add it incrementally or make a timed charge active
RNG& EntityPlayer::GetCollectibleRNG    (    CollectibleType     ID    )
back in a bit
no it accepts a CollectibleType
try googling iterate over enum values lua, that might help
setactivecharge seems to just refill all of it instantly
for the issue of removing a random collectible:
You could iterate over all the values in CollectibleType and call hascollectible on each one and add them to a list, then pick from that list
how do you refill charge
So I can't use the ExplosionDamage property of the bombs
i hope!!!
random collectible probably
Okay, so GetRoomEntities() is finding the bomb entities, but it doesn't seem to be detecting the actual BombEntities
GetCollectibleRNG() is what?
that's a bitch
fuckin hell
transit: I think there's one missing piece which is calculating the camera offset, but the basic gist is: 
1 tile = 40 units in game units
1 tile = 26 screen pixels
none from me
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    local enemy = player.GetLastDamageSource()
        if enemy:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
            enemy:AddBurn(EntityRef(player), 100, 1.0)
        end

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
i have another problem
but nah *any* news on world to screen coords i need it the npc state inspector i'm working on
really?
oh
Because GetRoomEntities() doesn't seem to detect the EntityBomb
Hm... How would I detect all of the bombs in the room?
kek
Are you kidding
/nick
good idea
transit change your name back
I'm gonna be annoyed if that's an oversight
i want to remove one random collectible
Anyone got news on coverting world coords to screen coords yet?
yeah
you can use "listcollectibles" in the debug console to show the text list
boolean     HasCollectible (CollectibleType Type)
integer     GetCollectibleNum (CollectibleType Type)
kind of
is there a way to get list of held items??
Or make a timed charge
add a charge
By increase charge do you mean add a charge on some event, or increase the number of charges to fill the bar
im going to (try) to make a mini mini mod
Can you increase a active item's charge?
goodnight, im soooo tired
anyone had a go at creating their own tarot cards yet?
<@266032468853915650> ok i will try
i tried to only make it happen to bombs but that didn't work so i removed the check and got that
haha xD
Islamic State-Mod?
<@258285593224544256> GetLastDamageSource()
nice!
i regret nothing https://streamable.com/fu0fo
Yes.
We couldn't make timed active items before, but can we now?
anybody an idea how i could get the enemy that damaged isaac
im tired
sorry
lol
main.lua
its main.lua
lua.main?
ok
to the lua.main
oh! i forgot to apply the changes!
<@152984637264756736> you have to put the main.lua in a folder and that folder has to be in your afterbirth+ mod folder
i know i think i am ?:
I forgot
We could always make the player take damage when he gets a coin
Anyone know how to I make an I make an item recharge over time?
<@152984637264756736> do other mods work ?
I am
who's ready to spend the whole dawn programmin mods?
mod wont work for me <@258285593224544256>
Well, I'll try this later, I need my bed, too
There should be a sfx-function, too. Maybe playing a sfx? ?
I have another Idee for this Mod!
thank parakeet
We can now steal your code to make damage-enabled things!
it gives the player a coin when he gets damaged
thanks to Parakeet we have another working mod now
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(1)
end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11
MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11
I FOUND IT
found them
docs are kinda meh though
in the docs, in the tools directory
"What callback would I use if I wanted it to run every frame?" ModCallbacks. MC_POST_UPDATE
were can i find all the callback constants like MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
Do you have a mod installed and enabled
back to work on rendering text, anyone figured out how to translate world coords to screen coords?
the console wont show up :(
not movement direction
<@148602144747028480> ja gleich XD
getlastdirection gets the last shot direction
no problem
<@258285593224544256> Gute Nacht? ?
thank you so much
for some reason I was expecting it to spawn a coin
<@129475107583295488> GetLastDirection might be what you need
oh wait it works
dude thank you so much man
<@124718540413599744> it works now for me
What do you mean?
Update
What callback would I use if I wanted it to run every frame?
...still doesn't seem to work...
ok wait i will try
the actual analog stick
<@258285593224544256> ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE -> ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG
player.Velocity or do you want the actual analog stick
is there something like getmovementdirection that gives you a vector instead of a direction
fix yo fucking shit Tyrone
alright thanks
damnit Instapreview still wants the exe even on Linux >.>
lol that's stupid
C:\Users\\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods

That's the ingame console
how do i get the console
what about the one this guy has https://puu.sh/tamSa/a69eba755d.png
ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE is nil
errrr
it's called zerobrane, https://studio.zerobrane.com
how do yoi get the debugger
<@99272749427474432> the workshop item is public. but noone can acess it, but it still shows up on my workshop files, and yeah
looking at it
<@266032468853915650> I can see it but if I click on it it says it's hidden. Btw are you from recife? haha
so how would i have to change my callback
thank you
Integer
Integer callback I'd
i can use the MC_USE_ITEM with hothead but not another spacebar item

Guys have you found out how to get the current room?
getting an issue

my callback

Hey, have you guys found out how to get access to the Level,Game or Room objects?
it means the first argument was supposed to be a number?
Sorry!

An error was encountered while processing your request:

The item is either marked as hidden or you do not have permission to view it.
anybody knows what this error means
main.lua:7: bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got nil)
how do you even get the debugger
http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyoZM/myworkshopfiles/
unless im missing something obvious
right now I'm getting way too tilted just trying to figure out how to translate object coords to screen coords
but there's 27 unique viewa
<@266032468853915650> no permission to view
yes
the link doesn't work
probably not
sorry for spamming my code, but does anyone have any idea what the error is, i know that it has something to do with the callback
I'll see if I can get any decent information from the steam API later
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834041002 i uploaded this an hour ago

They're uploader is completely useless
kind of a relief
Nope
so the workshop isn't up yet right?
it starts isaac and loads you into the room you're working on
What is instapreview?
you have to run the unpacker first
i think that they have to be extracted
I don't know if that's relevant or not
does the resources folder contain the extracted resources?
re-check the resources path
still says i dont have the thing
but it doesnt even do anything
Because I do this
Can anyone help me get instapreview working?

we dont know allot
its not bad it just
i got it for the content
well
yeah
And they're shite
We all got AB+ for the modding tools
does it start counting at 0 or 1
Because for real
i dont know
so its saying that happyDamage.getCoin is nil
i get that error in the log but i dont know why
Respond with this reaction below me if you hate the modding API we got with a burning passion
bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got nil)
:(
3U9FFHUIWRWEFHUIUHWEDFWEFHI
POO
my
oh
Question
So uhmm
nah still not working
did it work?!?!?!
<@186331772412231681> i have some error in my callback do you have any idea what it could be?
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
if they dont i wont use antibirth
Thank you so much! gonna try that out.
if they're willing to rewrite the whole thing from scratch maybe
is antibirth ever gona be normal afterbirth compatible
next, not sure why you're calling player:GetNPCTarget().Position. player.Position should do just fine
How about a counterfeit dollar item? Kappa
PickupVariant. PICKUP_COLLECTIBLE
You want to specify a variant of pickup to get a pedestal
next issue, spawning EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP will just give you a random drop, like if you cleared a room
oh. Thank you
<@186331772412231681> do you know what i have to change
EntityType.ENTITY_PICKUP
Enums have to be prefixed by the enum name
A few issues
no error, but also no results
doesnt work tho
im trying:
    local position = Isaac:GetFreeNearPosition(player:GetNPCTarget().Position, 10)
    Isaac.Spawn(ENTITY_PICKUP,0,0,position,0,player:GetNPCTarget())
has anyone figured out how to spawn item pedestrals near the player?
what can be the error
this is my callback
happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
i also use sublime text
a good text editor can auto-reload that log file every time it changes so you can just leave it open. I use sublime text and it reloads when i click on the file
this is the error i get in the log.txt
bad argument #2 to 'AddCallback' (number expected, got nil)
Btw guys, you can see errors occuring in the main.lua in the log at "Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+\log.txt"
ok
:O
If the code is in main.lua it will execute when the game starts if the mod is enabled
Anyone got a clue how to overwrite the music in AB+? The main way of doing it before isn't affecting it anymore.
Hopefully there's even a mod to be added to the game at the end of the month.
we put it in main.lua?
i wasnt the one who asked but thank you <@186331772412231681>
wait
poorly documented api
my mod for example wont work and we have no idea why
<@152984637264756736> Save data location/../The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/YourModName/main.lua
I'm trying to overwrite the music.
but only a few mods
Well?
<@123641250879504384> yes
<@109624258317033472> Gotten it to work but can't position it correctly
Does the api work or whatever
where do we put the scripts when we are done
uhh
Here's a quick PSA on attaching a debugger: https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lw81j/you_can_attach_a_debugger_to_your_lua_code/
<@124718540413599744> did you get RenderText to work?
i also think so
i bet the solution is like one little tiny thing
i it almost 4am in germany and i want to go to bed but i also want my mod to work
only to realize I was trying to call a method on the wrong class
I just dumped out the entire metatable of a class to figure out what was wrong with my code
player:AddCoins(-1) <--- Works, too.
I am an idiot
anyone know why
```Lua
player:AddCollectible(COLLECTIBLE_BRIMSTONE,0,true)
```
isn't working?
I try to make a pay 2 win-Item with Hothead
hi
ayy everybody
Not that it's not good, of course. It's not like we had to be given one.
If it's not possible to recreate every item that's currently in the game, then I'd consider the modding API to not be amazing
I'm not sure if I should be disappointed that there is no secret character in AB+
at least, nothing is indicated by the resource dump tool
yeah
It would've been nice if we had some existing items "ported" to Lua code as example
FUCK ME
NOPE
and make my works based off that
I was hoping to look at existing code
we know it isnt just you
well
nope
did it work?
<:isaac:257394072933761026>
i am sorry
to see if i got a coin
and i died by trying to get hurt
nice dude ?
i got moms knife trying to fix your code
luamod test also prints success
me neither but it doesnt work
im trying to help too buddy
I see no error.
i have been looking for a bug for 30 minutes now
i just cant find out why this wont work
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
this isn't so great
I might just ghetto rig one of the gmod doc tools and make my own docs
As if the documentation is useful for anything other than function names
is there somewhere in the documentation where i can see what the different callbacks like MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE need as arguments, beacause some only need a function and some a function and one thing more
only hothead works for me so far
ok, so dose anyone have a mod that DOSE work?
np
ok
no, sorry, still trying to figure out RenderText
<@124718540413599744> have you found a mistake in my code or a way to output to console?
Oh.
usually it claims it works regardless of the code
did you try lowercase benny?
nvm then
https://puu.sh/tamSa/a69eba755d.png
a guide is probably overkill
we fixed them already
so are we going to need a guide for how to fix the example mods?
wtf is wrong with my mod
i will give up
then i changed it bcs of hothead
i had the right thing in my mod
fuck that
jep
that's it?
ok
in hothead the getPlayer need a param apparently, just type 0 in the bracketrs
i believe
hothead has GetPlayer() it needs to be GetPlayer(0)
probably a terrible way to do it though
there seems to be a way to force an update
how do you fix hothead
uhh, for whoever was wanting to speed up the game
Has anyone figured out how Isaac.Spawn works? https://zatherz.eu/abplus/namespace_isaac.html#a255d49a94cd765f84231d71b9a6c12a7(edited)
no idea what the Spawner entity is, (last param)
what's wrong with hothead
ok
example mods and <@!96016391173332992> told me
where did you find the add callback
so mine should work
```
ModCallbacks = {
    MC_NPC_UPDATE = 0,
    MC_POST_UPDATE = 1,
    MC_POST_RENDER = 2,
    MC_USE_ITEM = 3,
    MC_POST_PEFFECT_UPDATE = 4,
    MC_USE_CARD = 5,
    MC_FAMILIAR_UPDATE = 6,
    MC_FAMILIAR_INIT = 7,
    MC_EVALUATE_CACHE = 8,
    MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT = 9,
  MC_USE_PILL = 10,
  MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG = 11
}
```
<@258285593224544256> scripts/enums.lua
i mean the documentation
Isaac.RenderText()'s coords seem really inconsistent
hm
Do we have any way of getting the resolution?
where in the subreddit are all the callbacks like MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE listed
wait
no not yet
well, did you try making it a :
they posted them on the tumblr once
where are the example mods?
in the example mods it is a . too
try making this "happyDamage.getCoin,"  into this   " happyDamage:getCoin,   "
hmmmm
this is my code still wont work
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
ok i restarted the game
niiice
So Isaac.DebugString() goes to this dumb log file and print() is just lost to the void
where do i put the script when im done?
still cant get it to work
has anybody figured out how Isaac.Spawn works
ok
it's still local when it's in the function
errors
it shows syntax
try log.txt
or?
but if i declare the player inside the function then it mustnt be local
i still cant find player sped <:isaac_angry:245063314898419712>
ok wait
declaring the player outside of the function likely causes issues
which could take a bit
ehh, I'll try debugging some of yall's code after I figure out what's going on with my garbage
I'm not sure.
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    player:AddCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
<@72413153614368768> do you know what my bug is
I'm trying to make a mod that has bombs explode while they're on the ground, but it's not working. Any tips on what I'm screwing up? https://hastebin.com/asukaqiwec.lua
since that would be about a million times easier to deal with
I might see if I can redirect output to a terminal
yeah, seems to be in the save directory
log file?
o shit
I was really hoping console, anyone found a way to print there instead?
iwi
whats this?
}
StageType = {
    STAGETYPE_ORIGINAL = 0,
    STAGETYPE_WOTL = 1,
    STAGETYPE_AFTERBIRTH = 2,
    STAGETYPE_GREEDMODE = 3
}
It goes to the log file
where's the output
has anyone figured out Isaac.DebugText ?
"HAVE FUN"
does someone know why my mod doesnt work
Like "HERE!"
yeah imagine if we had to do this by trial and error
In gmod they just made a script that dumped all the globals
As I said in the reddit thread, at least you got documentation
<@108221250249220096> We're at the beginning. If you may already know, the documentation is not the best
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    player:AddCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
but the one i wrote doesnt
the one example mod you posted here works
so you have it selected in the mod menu
but i wonder why my mod wont work
Okay, so I want to make mods but I dont know how to really program with lua. Does replacing sprites require any coding knowlage?
now
ok the mod works for me nw
btw im trying to make the game speed be the same as the players velocity (superhot)
What am I missing with RenderText
ok
<@258285593224544256> https://puu.sh/taloX/1ab46fe30d.mp4
why do no mods work for me
*chalenge
im trying to change the games speed like how the speed chalange works
I like how it says Success! even when the mod had a syntax error.
ok sooo
not for me lol
neato
Yes, its working
this should give you the coins on run start right?
local testMod = RegisterMod("Hiding")

function testMod:player_init(unknownparameter)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(99)
    player:AddGoldenKey()
end

testMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, testMod.player_init)
does the log.txt file throw an error for the mod?
i just found the scripts folder
does the folder name have to be the same as the mod name
ohh!
still doesnt work
^
AddCoins probably needs to be capitalized
<@152984637264756736> enums file in the game
im so dumb
where do you ghet the callbacks?
<@258285593224544256> you might need to give the callback the reference to the entity you are talking to
but why does my code not work
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
brb, making everything
finally!
Here is a mod that works
no clue man
local testMod = RegisterMod("Hiding")

function testMod:player_init(unknownparameter)
    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:AddCoins(99)
    player:AddGoldenKey()
end

testMod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_PLAYER_INIT, testMod.player_init)
also tfw no RenderSprite
i have it activated under the mods panel
any ideas why
local happyDamage = RegisterMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:addCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
mod still doesnt work
i restarted my game
aka lowercase
not the actual mod name
run `luamod <mod directory name>`
Both work
or someone
<@!226519543588192256> can you post your example mod?
Or do luamod [modname]
no
Yes
do i have to restart my game so the mod updates
Oh, nvm
Why do you have ModCallbacks and EntityType before your stuff in the AddCallback?
dump it please
do i have to make a new run so the mod updates
Think I made a Hello World mod that works
I think
thought you had code that worked
RegisterMod needs to be capitalized
ahh damn it
i dont know
it doesnt work for me
no
do i have an error somewhere
thank you
local happyDamage = registerMod("Happy Damage")

function happyDamage:getCoin()

    local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
    player:addCoins(1)

end

happyDamage:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, happyDamage.getCoin, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER)
Just anything to know that mod code is running
Which I have not yet figured out what to do
Isaac.RenderText("Hello World", 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)
anybody figured out how to spawn tears
I thought you meant displaying it in the game
oh
Isaac.DebugString("Hello World")
how would you make a hello world mod...
Nothing I find works
Does anyone have a code dump somewhere of a simple hello world mod that works? just to confirm that I'm not going insane?
like lucky me I looked at the game's assembly and learned that you gotta use these two strings but I would've been totally lost otherwise
```
player:AnimateCollectible(itemId, "UseItem", "PlayerPickupSparkle")
```
I'm a bit annoyed there's not a simpler way to do this when you use an item
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
thank
IzlePox probably in PostUpdate callback
how to room editor
so I changed it to D6
also no item called Pyrokinesis
how do i get issacs speed/momentum
ok uhh
urgh what a pain
For example, in Hothead, Isaac.GetPlayer( ) has to be Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
Oh?
You need to do some modifications to get them to run
Can't even get DebugString to work in any of the callbacks
Has anyone gotten any of the example mods to run?
We already have the Piggy Bank for that, don't we?
I guess I can google it
Also does anyone know what the "Color" documentation means by red offset blue offset green offset
i am currently trying to make a mod that gives you a coin everytime you take damage
yeah
Ooh, that could be nice.
Thoughts on me making a debugging mod that shows NPCs' "states" (attack, idle, etc) with colors?
what are the different resources folders?
i thought i saw one in the console
why is there no EntityTear? That's odd.
i will try something
<@!96016391173332992> i think i have understood addCallback now
shoe?~?~!?~!?!
amazing
freezer baby why ;-;
can learn it in Y minutes https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
Lua is a pretty easy language
its really easy
so how hard is lua to learn
wtf are these reaction things
what should I do? ?
I remember when I first started Roblox I didn't even know what "while true do" meant,  I just thought it was just doing "infinite loop"
That page literally has nothing to do with roblox ?
http://wiki.roblox.com/?title=Loops
btw heres the roblox wiki im talking about
less confusion
its own
I'd say its own wiki.
would be better
its own wiki
or should it have its own wiki
thanks
should the more extensive modding docs be in the gamepedia wiki?
https://zatherz.eu/abplus
yea i guess we'll just have to experiment
wheres the api referense
The functions don't even have descriptions, you just have to infer from the name of the function
wait
were is something about callbacks in the documentation
it's better than having nothing at all to work with, but it's difficult to say the least
An Isaac modding wiki could be a good thing
I mean this API reference is literally just that, a reference
fairly sparse at that
far from a tutorial or anything
And the docs we get are bad, therefore making it harder to make our own, better docs
i still play roblox (6 J 6)
for the first time
yea well we're literally seeing all of this stuff
i remember roblox, was fun. i learned most of my lua from Unitale
they hade a whole coding wiki
tbh i learned lua from roblox :(
there is not
there should be
ok
<@258285593224544256>
```
<Mod>:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DAMAGE, <function>, EntityType.ENTITY_PLAYER )
```
shouldnt there be a mod wiki for ab+?
tbh i'm gonna wait until people better at programming than me get a better documentation until i start making real mods
you go beep boop
I think I know how
idk code
does somebody know how to detect if the player took damage
The only problem is that it is 100% screwed up in every aspect
its just
i know lua
you should first learn lua
as in ab+
ok i might seem stupid but uh, how do i start programming?
in console i type luarun test.lua but nothing happens
i have test.lua in the binding of isaac rebirth folder
it doesnt work
Why am I asking, everyone knows pretty much as much as everyone else about how to mod right now
How would you create a tear effect?
or at least that's how I am :p
ok
that's how you test code
and run `luarun test.lua`
put test.lua in Steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth
then
if you want to test it
nice
lel my test mod folder is called test too
i just want to test it
idk
have it trigger on something i guess
the folder is called test
I mean
when i do luamod test in console it writes succes but i dont get coins
luarun
true
Well, if you have just that in a folder, I'd imagine it would just give the player 99 coins every time main.lua was run
i have it in a folder
so you can't just make a file that says that and have it work
and with luamod test i
but it'll need to be wrapped in something I think
hm k thx anyways
it*s for the modding ?
yes but that won't fix anything
That code should work.
should, yes, Code
also wrong channel
that code should work right?
its this or wait until they fix it (probably 1 month from now)
can I someow clear the download folder?
local player = Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
player:addCoins(99)
yes
what
lol
uninstall avira and reboot
alright so i had the same issue and here is the only temporary fix that exists
it seesm at least *not entirley nonsensical* relative to other options
yes
Maruhai - Today at 2:09 AM
is you antivirus avira by any chance
pls halp <:isaac:257394072933761026>
idk
i *guess*
not sure what the license on the docs is but
upload the documentation to GH and improve it off there?
is you antivirus avira by any chance
couldn't we just like
xbagon
I might try but it's a lot tbh
mobdebug is fucked for some reason
a good one
Can someone make a real documentation
Pooping Monstro works if you remove `require("mobdebug").start()`
that's a nice mod there
wtf I disabled my antivirus
Good morning, just a little question: Does anyone have the issue to open the developer console, too? I can't open the developer console, although I activated a mod.
wow what an amazing mod https://gfycat.com/TintedUnhealthyAssassinbug
sick
well, in the tools folder IN the Rebirth installation folder
how easy it is to make new room sizes
the ModUploader tool in the Rebirth installation folder
ok so
how did you publish to it btw
oooohhh GOOOOD every time antivir is deleting it and I have no idea how to stop it SwiftRage
it's also not obtainable legit because i have no idea how to add items to item pools
I love it
amazing
but it's on there
i mean you can't visit the steam workshop
it's on the steam workshop rn
amazing
nice
that's it
when you use it you die
time to pump out 100 items in a day
it's a shittily sprited smiley face active item
i got one
phew
I want to get cancer fast
quick where can I get the shittiest mods made in the first 2 hours of release
And we thought that they released a not working modding api
finally i can mod
yeah, i found a post on /r/themoddingofisaac
im gonna shit a toaster i cant believe it was that simple
i love reddit
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5lvhn6/so_where_do_i_actually_install_the_mods/
ok i have found a way
oh
simple as that to get it working
Isaac.GetPlayer() needs to be Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
can you share the code?
yeah
did you get an items effects to actually work
wait
i've made a very basic item and uploaded it to the steam workshop(which you can't even visit yet) but I don't actually have the item in an item pool
well, *later* today *technically*
at least not until tomorrow
well I don't have other OSes to test it on so I can't help you there.
er... how would you put an item into the item pool?
or i am just totally retarded
i feel like it works on windows and linux but not on mac
no clue about others thugh
i dont have that folder
again that's on Linux at least
again, in `$HOME/.local/share/binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/`
$HOME being your home directory (`/home/whatever`)
where do i have to put that folder
wooo, mod created
but yeah just creating an empty "hello world" folder will add a mod to your list that you can enable and get the debug console
yeah i dont have that file
it's mentioned in the savedatapath.txt file
<@258285593224544256> 
`$HOME/.local/share/binding of isaac afterbirth+ mods/`
salt = 50
man i want to make mods, but i cant find the folder
oh
It needs to be Isaac.GetPlayer(0)
just the fucking extractor
when you do Isaac.GetPlayer()
Everything else works
MODS AREN'T BROKE
<@102708051164790784> have you found the folder to put your mods
Am I the only one that the ResourceExtractor doesnt work for?
I'm late as always but looks like they're using Steam Workshop for exporting, whee
well yeah i cant find the folder to my mods
you can just make an empty folder in the mod folder and the game picks it up as a valid mod
goood my antivirus is removing all the mod tools SwiftRage
you have to enable a mod and then press the ` key in-game
how did you get in it
\o/
WE IN THE CONSOLE BOIS
yes
That sucks.
i am in that folder but dont have that file
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth
lol
oh
to the .txt file
C:\Users\\[name]/Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods/
maybe i can find something
I'm on windows, it likely wouldn't help, but OK
can you give me your path to it
Wow.
You don't?
ok oops
i dont have a savedatapath.txt file
<@258285593224544256> savedatapath.txt in your Rebirth installation folder has the Modding Data path
I guess that's meant to be a Steam workshop uploader?
oh okay it does work nevermind.
So, AddCallback seems to be what's broken
but there is only a Tabletop Simulator folder in
ok i found a My Games folder
wait no uhm
it's the fucking ModUploader that's in Windows format only
*of all the things*
roomeditor segfaulted
wee
no clue.
but do you know where you have to put your mods on mac/linux
I think ithat's Doxygen anyway?
yes resource extractor works i know
there's Doxygen stuff in the Luadoc folder also
they said the tools wouldn't work on Linux/macOS
turns out, they actually do (well, resource extractor does, and RoomEditor needs some Qt5 stuff apparently but still)
faith restored \o/
the tools themselves seem alright imo but i have no idea what to do without any actual documentation lmao
but I'm not optimistic
Imma reserve judgement on these mod tools for a little while
i cant find any folder
np ^.^
Oh thank you ?
then select the rooms folder (you should already be in it) and submit it
and import binary
then hit the file button
ok
These modding tools look cancer
that's intended
<@96618273503731712>
Not gonna lie
Just make sure to use RegisterMod and not Isaac.RegisterMod
Now I can't get this to work after getting resources.
it wraps RegisterMod to have the functionality we were shown
look in resources/scripts/main.lua
No it doesn't, Dr. Alto
though IDK
the first field being a table and the second being a string for the name of the mod
i srsly cant find a folder to put mods on my mac
it looks like registermod requires two fields now
use `giveitem c511` to get hothead
how do i even enable mods
I'm stupid, what does this mean? I was trying to run the unpacker
It's Items.xml that creates the item, then
well yeah main.lua is doing nothing to make it spawnable
hmm i commented out all of main.lua and the item is still spawnable
this applies both to my custom mod and the example mods
yeah if I use luamod
Wait, you get "Failed to load mod!"? Nothing even shows up for me.
for some reason
its just that they dont do anything
my mods successfully loaded
would be nice if it gave a proper reason for failing
which according to the documentation only runs main.lua
if you use luamod and try to load... well, anything... it gives you "Failed to load mod!" or w/e
ok
they aren't, Code
i also wouldnt see a reason for that but
Also mobdebug didn't connect
im running windows
i mean i dont hope so
could it be possible that mods are windows only
I think what's happening is that main.lua isn't being read
let's fiddle around
well, that might just be a minor change then
Items appear in game but do nothing
hm
so did any mod work yet?
didnt do anything
yea i tried the example mod
Hey, nice
they don't, Alto?
let's try it bitch
too bad items dont even work smh
i was stressin
good point ;-;
by making a players.xml in the content folder of ur mod and just adding your own entry
that's entirely possible
Oh!
i think you can add new characters the same way you can add new items
Hit enter with nothing written
nevermind
Cant close the console
this update is worse than we thought
i keep searching, but i am currently reinstalling isaac
well this is disappointing
I'm still looking
No custom characters, really
it's there, Code. Promise. I just have no clue where it is
which isn't promising
```
Steam_SetMinidumpSteamID:  Caching Steam ID:  76561198036453247 [API loaded no]
```
the folders to install mods seem to be not available on mac
Why do entities have a Kill function AND a Die function?
no custom characters? hahahaha what the fuck didnt they say thats a thing
also, whenever it loads up in console it prints this
i'm looking through the docs
yea the example mods dont work
also, i don't think we can add characters...?
right
read the bit about the console in the docs,
it basically just lists all functions etc. without descriptions
well the documentation doesnt help that much
What use is an example mod if it doesn't work
can I spawn items? I dont know whether my mods are working or not
well i dont have the folders
maybe they changed it or something
*slow clap*
modding doesnt even work
amazing
is super bandage new?
yeah I can't get anything to work
The items even show up in game, it just seems like the main.lua isn't even being read or something
i dont even have the folders to install them
oh my god nicalis how do you fuck up your most important feature
this is amazing if it doesn't work
i don't think so
Do mods work for anyone else? I tried making my own active item and also installed the Hothead example mod and neither of them did anything when I used them.
takes 20minutes because my internet connection is so crappy
i am currently reinstalling the binding of isaac rebirth
uhm
ok so i can't get mods to load
well, when i open isaac, start a game and go back to the menu, the top border and bottom borders of the screen are black
I was about to lose my goddamn mind
Absolutely. Goddamn. Livid. I thought Afterbirth+ was an elaborate prank
I was *livid*
and for a moment
Also just for the record I opened up Isaac and the "April Fools" achievement unlocked
i dont have My Games i documents
probably in Documents somewhere? idk man
Does somebody know where to put the mods on a mac?
read the instructions mate
>You might want to import them from binary STB files
whenever i open the room editor it crashes
https://gyazo.com/0635a438b7208460949dcb1ebaa54480
Ah thanks Transit
just accept that
I dont have these folders Documents/My Games/Afterbirth+ Mods
and it should default to the rooms folder with nothing shown in it
and hit import binaries
go to the context menu
yeah
?
and I extracked
even though they are there
and now it cant find the room files
So I did this
http://i.imgur.com/ByjRhYc.png
or if it already has it at the end UNLIKE ON LINUX just don't do anything
or \resources I guess on windows
but then just open it up and you can import the folder full of stbs
also you have to run resources extracter first
and add /resources at the end of the directory path
<@123641250879504384> edit settings.ini
does anybody know where i can put mods on a mac
how do you even use the damn room editor
so uh
that's a dumb chapter name
the void
in My Games i dont have a binding of isaac folder
but its not in the room editor
the new chapter is called the Void
i found jacobs ladder in the item pool editor
what
i have a mac, i cant find the folders
IsaacAnimationEditor, IsaacItemPoolEditor, LuaDocs, ModUploader, ResourceExtractor, RoomEditor,
also yes it has an unpacker
wait i will see agin
i mean that's not the exact path but it's in My Games
Documents/My Games/Afterbirth+ Mods
I just told you
does somebody know where i have to put my mods
does it have an unpacker built in actually because if they make us still use rick's unpacker i'm gonna trip *hard*
who's to say honestly
I think you gotta unpack first??
also how do room editor work
in the game files
where are the mod tools
i dont have these folders
i cant believe this works
omg
does it matter where they are
Documents/My Games/Afterbirth+ Mods
but srsly
haha
press the make mod button
in which folder do i have to put my mods
ayy
docs are here boys
Nice my antivirus flagged the Item Pool Editor as potentially dangerous
amazing really
This is gonna be a lot of fun
lua docs!
yesss
ok ty
steamapps/common/rebirth/tools/LuaDocs
where
docs are included in the installation
no documentation
it is out
nice
surprise surprise nothing yet
nope
is there a documentation?
when you install a mod
that makes the archivement locked
that diseable the thing
i wan't a mod
"lol just use cheat engine to teleport yourself to blue womb when it crashes, nbd"
Imagine if people said shit like that for every issue
if we have to use SAM then what is the point of even locking them in the first place
"lol just use SAM"
Just mod it i-oh ?
i would mod that in OH WAIT NO ACHIEVEMENTS
true
saddest part about ab+ is no mudeth soundtrack when ill play ?
i am pretty happy that they havent decreased the amount of items once more
buy yourself a gas mask
bye
ok you're 12
>grow up
grow up
that's like saying we all enjoy a nice cheeseburger so don't get mad at every little glass shard in it
flotilla
Good riddance
im out
alright I cant handle this toxic atmosphere
i much more enjoy being negative
lol
I'm positively certain that nicalis is fucking stupid
I'm very positive
is there already a documentation?
try to be positive for once
we all enjoy the game so don't try to get mad at every "pointless" decision made by nicalis
19 minutes until sad
and hating on nicalis' stupidity gets me off like nothing else
if its pointless dont get worked up about it
yeah
Going by how it was in Rebirth, it is most certainly the latter
pointlessly stupid
its pointless
I see no reason to be upset
I'll know what I have and haven't done legit
why disable steam achievmeents if you dont disable ingame unlocks??????
If it's not the latter
well
Playing with mods will be like playing seeded runs 100% of the time; you can unlock nothing
anyway whatever I'm just downloading a 100% save when one comes out
we know no more than you do though
even then
i think they're disabling everything
not just achievements
or do they not allow you to unlock things in game
AND unlocks
and even then superficial mods shouldn't be disabled
are they only disabling steam achivements
disabling mods in dailies makes sense though
but singleplayer achievements? come ooooon
sure of course
yeah ok
only thing i understand is disabling mods in dailies
I need clarification on one thing
dumb as hell!
because characters and challenges don't even effect the unlocks
it makes no sense to me that if i add, say, a new character or a new challenge that all achievements are disabled
yeah why make people have to choose between which way they have fun, unlocks vs mods
more content
the mods i'd want are mods like antibirth
It shouldn't be one or the other
yeah
People want to do their unlocks legit **and** use mods
Yes, that's the entire issue
im doing my unlocks legit
er, achivements
what
to get your unlocks
what sort of mods do you guys want to use anyway?
like whatever they're enjoying the game, let them be
Guarantee you there will be a "Thank you, Nicalis. Don't listen to the trolls" etc thread made a day after AB+ comes out and people start getting disenchanted
i just dont get why some people care if someone gets achievements easier with some OP mods
I mean they don't need to remember if people are around to defend them despite it being the dumbest move yet
guess not lmao
yeah i thought nicalis would have remembered how people reacted during rebirth
plus sometimes they have the greatest icons to show off to nerds
This was quickly reverted because NO ONE liked it
The way it was implemented in Rebirth is that unlocks and achievements were disabled if you were running mods, much like playing a seeded run
me too
^
they're not meaningless, i enjoy them
but steam achivements are literally meaningless
They are
it would be one thing if actual in game unlocks were disabled
because then those are hurt too
and then what's left? actual mods?
instead of making op eden mods people are just going to make op eden cheat engine tables
this doesn't deter cheaters
the point is
i'm not going to talk to someone who will call me an idiot when I never insulted them back
The issue is that we don't *want* to cheat, you idiot
or we could not have to do a stupid workaround for something that should be a non-issue
And yes, they did the same thing with Rebirth and reverted it after community outrage
who cares
or you could play with your mods and cheat them in
^
tldr people who can cheat can still cheat and only legitimate players are hurt
nicalis has done this once before and quickly reverted it
What if it takes 500 hours to 100% AB+ for some stupid reason, have fun not using any mods for 500 hours
get a tinfoil medal for killing the hush with keeper
its just a dumb restriction for no reason
All it does is deincentivize people to use mods
You can download a cheat engine table and give yourself polybrim in two seconds, any retard can do that
yeah
OP eden starts exist already
who the hell cares about steam acheivments
a lot of people here are planning to use SAM just to spite nicalis
than just use a mod
you'd be surprised
yeah except way less people would use the steam achivement manager
because cheat engine and steam achievement manager exists
this only hurts mods and modders
that too
All this does is hurt people who want to play mods from day one
but actual mods? ones that just edit sprites or fix a few bugs? nope, rip achievements
why bother restricting mods
<@108717851623374848> Because if I wanted to cheat my achievements I could download Steam Achievement Manager and not give a shit at all
profit
>Install mods
if people want to cheat then let them cheat
>Clear AB+
Honestly, I don't get why people are upset either
i can literally download steam achievement manager and give myself all achievements the second they come out
<@108717851623374848> it's a single player game and legitimate mods are effected too
yeah even antibirth one can do that
why are people upset about this? it would be so easily exploitable otherwise
the most basic shit
getting the position of an entity is like
without it there's no way to make the antibirth tesla coils
I hope youll be able to get an enemy's position
yarp
I want to pin this but idk where it would be appropriate or even if it would come up often enough
thank you jerry

sounds fair
let's go down to nicalis hq and physically push it into the sea
now that people have the ability to make actual gameplay-changing mods rather than a bunch of "OP CHARACTER" mods, they're disabling achievements? genius
oh wow
hm I like how achievements work in isaac.. antibirth did it well
but yaknow
XBagon i mean i'll make fakechievements for bigger mods i guess

thx for ignoring FeelsBadMan
it seems fun to make

edmund mcmillen is an anagram of lend me mild cumn

which os is i7?
true
idk probably a botnet
what's i7 window manager though
ok we're good
exactly
i have that
i mean

nor is it i7
my os isn't i3

uh oh guys i have a problem
tyrone rodriguez is an anagram of terrorized guy no?
hahah wow
yea
ab+ isn't even up as a dlc yet
it's the toe under the nail which is rotten to the core
http://i.imgur.com/Qenpaxc.png
it's the one part which is okay
pajeet I keep telling you your toenail is totally fine
so we report for wrong advertising? ?
tyron is an anagram for  fuck you llol
that's why it's diseased
your toenail is nicalis
yeah
my toenail
nicalis is tag spamming for ab+ not to flop
wtf
nicalis is an anagram of sic nail
uhm wait... why is there the multiplayer tag on steam?
tyrone is a tyro
no shit
a company
is
nicalis
oh nice
`nicalis` is an anagram of `farce`
it does
yeah im waiting for those
come on does it even have steam achievements
like
oh yeah why isn't the ab+ achievements on steam yet
his name is SAM
i know a good friend
im gona do the edning and then do the modding
actualy I probably won't even play
same
whoops I'm not playing your game right
10/10
wow
so I'll just download a new 100% as soon as one is ready
I mean I'm going to be modding straight away, after like 3 runs or something
an EXE MOD
wait for it
is there something like itemgroups in the game? not the pools, but something like all the coin trinkets?
it'll be
so it wont be a mod
yeah
except they wont expose that
hope they merge that one in early
? ? ?
looking forward to the day 2 mod to reenable achievements with mods
they killed the main feature
so essentially
Entirely makes the most sense, yeah
wouldnt make sense to just disable steam achievements
entirly
can't wait to find out
well it's stupid as shit either way
i think entirely
what
Do they disable achievements entirely (would be idiotic imo) or do they only disable steam achievements?
we don't know what nicalis has prepared for
it could be something as simple as two characters being set to ID 16 or something
just depends on how nicalis makes them load in
also that
why would they be incompatble tho
they showed that
no we can add characters
and think about mods trying to interact with other mods LUUL
or maybe we won't be able to add characters at all still! wouldn't surprise the hell out of me
or some stupid shit like that
so we'll have to adopt some standard to interact with a general character adding mod
like maybe any mod that wants to add a character will be incompatible with another
I imagine what we'll most sorely need if nicalis doesn't provide it is tools for combining mods and being able to merge them properly and let them interact with each other
?
cya transit ??
for overhauls and shit
no, fake achievements
bye
seeya
obviously it means 'fake' achievements
anyway peace y'all i'm hangin with my gf
because they *disable achievements* when you use mods
achievement api isn't happening
pfft
yeah that sounds good if it turns out we need it
like one thing that was actually suggested was making an "achievement api" that other mods could use and I think that's a brilliant idea if it's not already in the game
real programmers smash that mf **MAKE MOD** button
old meme
Don't you know how real programmer do it? https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png
I also would prefer it if modding is entirely opaque to the dumbasses on the subs
nah, I was planning on abstracting some shit out and making apis and stuff
The way it was described was vague so I assumed the worst, apologies if I jumped the gun ?
no
drag drop editor PogChamp
but you plan to make utility programs for modding yeah?
don't*
yeah I know lol
god no
no I do't want to make a drag and drop editor
until they have a barely working script
Me who wha
they'll just copypaste code from stackoverflow
it's going to happen anyways
pajeet I hope that you actually try to make mod tools so that transit can kick your ass up and down the block
i dont want stupid ppl to be able to make mods
A GUI-based editor??
no please
Didn't <@96016391173332992> want to make something similar though
will never exist, let alone be decent
they give us lua to program whole isaac from the ground PogChamp
unless you want to use my drag and drop maker
there's no drag and drop mod maker and that's probably for the best
that doesn't change
good
ok
you need to know lua
no shit
yeah
please
with thee modding tools you would still need to know code right
skype is a good mod tool for people too stubborn to switch
mmmmmMMMMMmmmmm
i sure do love notepad++
discord is a good mod tool for collaborative modding

time for a rude awakening!
If you use a stick to draw lines in the sand to change the length of a football field, is the stick a modding tool
OH BOY
MOD TOOLS MOD TOOLS
MOD TOOLS GUYS
DAE MOD TOOLS?
not to mention the subreddit uses that phrase religiously
But it's such a dumb phrase jesus
beyond a url to lua.org/pil
There should be an animation editor, so modding tool**s** is *technically* accurate
it makes it sound as if they actually plan to release programs to make modding easier
i hate that phrase so much
seriously
we don't know if there will be a single actual mod tool other than their shitty knockoff basement renovator and maybe some animation editor thing
yes
noodle should add "modding tools" as a banned phrase for robobaby
yea
inb4 none of it is possible
I'm actually pretty hyped for the modding tools, but I doubt I should release mods with placeholder sprites ? But I have so great ideas <:isaac:257394072933761026>
?
all the antibirth lua scripts which have been made so far have been made with a completely barebones placeholder set of lua functions
who says that they would implement simple things? ?
well probably even with ab+ stuff, it's extremely simple
totally doable with mod tools Kappa
something I couldn't do in the api
damage will probably scale to the floor
hm the damage is too high
it's so hard to dodge tears while using it though that it could probably have just 1 or 2 room charge time
not sure how you could balance this...
ye I know
it's just a prototype test!!!!!!
needs some balancing though ?
I saw that veeery cool

if there will be workshop it'll only be up once the game releases so
how are even supposed to officially share mods now ? i dont see any sign of a workshop integration or anything similar to that besides moddingofisaac.com which is not moderated by nicalis (what they definetly want todo)
sometimes it may well mean that
i thought FTFY means "Fuck That Fuck You"...
or "finitely this falsity yearns"
referring to the errors in someone's post before you fix them
I thought it meant "fewer then fewer yet"
Oh wait, your one works better

I think anyway
"Fixed that for you"
fuck the fucking youth?
I only just remembered what FTFY meant :/
Oh well
oh weird
I was close. I just though "if I recall correctly"
'if I recount considerably'
Oh wait nvm
I'd integrate your ass
if nicalis ever wanted to integrate my ass I'd want cash for it too
Ok, help me clear this up for a sec, what does IIRC mean?
compensation and still having full creative control over it
yes thats the plan
And I agree 100% with that stance
IIRC Kil said he's definitely gunning for some sort of compensation for official integration
And then Ed pops his head out from a loose floorboard screaming "help they've taken me hostage"
hahhahahaahahah
Kil: "Ok, we'll make it official, but what's our payment"
Nicalis: "pay...ment...?"
so
which imo they likely wont
it depends on if nicalis will have a good deal for them
Or do it, just to spite me
I think that you shouldn't do it. Just to spite him
nothing new is actually confirmed, its still up in the air
edmund is being optimistic yeah
Yeah that
Or is Edmund being optimistic?
added to ab+?
what do you mean
Did kilburn actually confirm Antibirth being part of the original game?
make a hypercube of tears
¯\_(?)_/¯
Did you say lua api?
Antibirth+ when?
nope
can normal people use it
but yeah antibirth has a "super secret" lua api
To me it is
are you really so dense that you think an expanding square of projectiles is a big mathematical riddle?
antibirth
How are you guys doing this? Have you got some really super secret Isaac mod tools? Or is this smoke and mirrors and you've photoshopped each frame to confuse plebs like me?
the velocity
buuuut
you idiot
pressing the ab+ make mod button
that's how
it linearly iterates on the x and y of a vector both ways
at least tell me *how* you'd do it
you're the one who wastes all your time on simple bullshit, I've got better things to do
exactly
thats just some math
do it
this is stupid as shit

and you chose **squares of tears**
you chose one thing to be impressive

Also I even uploaded that file using the command line, haha
i don't. I just use find if I need to find something, which I almost never tend to do
I sort of want to show y'all how i use my browser, too, but it's hard to show if you can't see my keyboard
Very optimized search utility via command line
mlocate?
do you have mlocate?
it's incredibly useful
<@!182509747835109387> Sorta

how can you live without ms paint
I had to get google chrome file manager
kek
ignore the porn game I torrented btw
file managers are tedious enough to me

i just know my system like the back of my hand
it's literally slower going through directories with a file manager, though, with the double clicking
the color's a bit washed out, but whatever
^
looks pretty fun if you love tedium
It's a pain to go through directories.
Why don't you have a file manager?
This looks like DOS.
it's 90% keyboard as well
there's me using my computer

she*
idk file managers just slow me down
she's brave
the absolute madman
nope
wow not even a file manager?
<@193445062657572865> Did you figure it out?
egh
you have to type in all the paths tho
I mean I can record it if you want
how can you live life
how
Copy and paste everything in the file into  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources
i literally don't have a file manager or anything whenever I want to do anything with file management I just open a new command line window
but don't really use it
i have linux
nice
I'm on linux, so *shrug*
i hate coding batch files
dos is hard for me
I fumble in cmd any time I have to use it for GUIless unpackers, I can't imagine using it near-exclusively
Ok I got the file , now what
Jeez transit
You have to right click, go to 7-zip, and click on extract files.
I use command line for literally everything
my bad then
oh
open your real life window, and just throw
Double clicking doesn't work with 7-zip.
and then unplug your computer
the one you wanted to open
alright now double click the rar file
Yeea I clicked on it and installed it
pls
the file
click
double
It's what you downloaded.
<@147076393937797121> pin plz
It's a program you execute.
What is an executeable
Did you click on the executable?
Now what
Ok
<@193445062657572865> Download the 64-bit one unless you have a really old PC.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+unzip+rar+files
Which one do I downlaod
http://www.7-zip.org/
Can someone give me a link to a download ?
arguable
7zip is better.
.rar is basically .zip but different
programs
winzip
Whats winrar
or something else
?
get winrar
jk
never mind i'm not helping you
I downloaded this mod https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/66/extremely-overpowed-start

install how?
.rar then
Idk
extension?
Hey guys , anyone know how to install a rar file?
he seems stupid overpowered anyway
Yeah, not sure why the hell he thinks apollyon needs flight to be super good
we don't need a third flight character
there's already too much damn flight in the game
5 sec charge d6

good times
kil and ikana both message me on discord saying "jer plz delet this"
yeah i posted to reddit
seems like I'm never at the right place at the right time
and then you posted it to reddit lel
another leak was the same video from the leather leaks but posted here
one was on leather's channel, youtube derped and made some unlisted antibirth videos public
two sets actually
no there was a leak
pretty much
Unless they lied about the leak.
Some of them are Kil's friends, and some were there when the leak happened.
be an antibirth tester
luck? know him?
just wondering, but what did you guys need to do to get kilburn's api?
They add 1095 more entries that go up to Nov 1st 2021
"Thank you for emailing us. We'll be fixing this issue shortly."
email and ask
?
Why
the 1st of november
I only rememeber
no
remember, remember
No, it was made by an outsider, planning to assasinate nicalis on the 1sr of november
but it's still bizarre that they did them all at once
to be almost somewhat fair, steam's leaderboards system is not robust at all
...why is not being updated automatically
I doubt it will last until the end of 2018.
It's probably so that they don't have to keep updating it.
lol
What the fuuuu
<@70946604139425792> thanks for the free karma let's go on reddit and say "afterbirth end of life november 2018"
So half of these aren't filled out yet
<@89855974113824768> I'm saying that for whatever reason, instead of having the daily stats update with each passing day, Nicalis made 1800+ different stat pages for every day from Nov 1st 2015 to Nov 1st 2018
^
play the workshop guessing meme in <#207259602969034753> pls
lmao as if anyone cares about dailies
What do you mean flotilla
my meme is bad
nicalis is fucking crazy
forced meme

what?
So half of these entries don't yet exist
http://steamcommunity.com/stats/250900/leaderboards/1467769 Nicalis allows you to look at daily run stats on the Steam page, but for whatever reason they manually created entries for every single day up to November 1st, 2018???
yeah post workshops in <#207259602969034753> if this is the hip new meme
rocket league
Okay WTF, someone explain this to me
Stop posting workshops

fuck

it is gmod
wait
I don't know of any other workshop game that has a dupe tag, so welp
besiege?
left4dead or skyrim
o
]
I've seen gmod, not that
Nah
Definitely Gmod
Construct your own isaac gameplay with common mods like "Shit item 1" and "Bad sprites 1"
^
gmod?
what incentive is there when people get their mods merged
what steam workshop is this?
like
I'd download a mod that changes the face of mega satan to be nicalis
Pay 50$ to buy 5 packs + 1 free!
hahahaha
You can make your mod paid but Nicalis gets 100% of the money.
rare*
?
One guaranteed rate mod in each pack!
lol whats in it for nicalis then?
as if tho
lol open packs to get mods
I sorta hoped that it wouldn't be literal paid mods and be more like "any mod maker who has their mod integrated into AB+ will be compensated by Nicalis in some way"
What shit
inb4 monthly **FOIL** COMMUNITY BOOSTER PACKS
watch, all mods have to be uploaded to steam workshop to run, they must all be listed for at least 1$, and nicalis gets 50% cut
OH MY GOD I FORGOT ABOUT THAT SHIT
I'd pay $20 for isek
i hope they realized how dumb of an idea that was
lol
did nicalis ever talk about the paid mod shit again
hahahahahaah
well and because valve discourages launching games during sales
Look at this meme.
prob
prob just cause they have to deal with refunds
tis a shame
but now I gotta click the buy button on the day it comes out rather than a day before
Instead they encourage launch-week discounts
lol
Valve strongly recommends that devs *not* allow preorders now for some reason I forgot
the assumed reason that the DLC launches on the 3rd is because of the winter sale
I regret that decision
It could either be that or Valve's stance on allowing preorders got to them
I preordered battleborn
no pre order is because of the launch time
i dont think xcom 2 had a workshop before it launched either
honestly what is there to expect
no pre-orders, DLC tagged non-local co-op, cryptic API information
Yeah, you time the launch of workshop functionality just like game releases IIRC
I'm a soul in search of answers
whatever is common doesnt apply to them
this is nicalis
is it common for a game to not have any sign of a workshop even a day before launch?
Workshop is the easiest thing for them so it'll either be that or nothing at all, and they just leave us to use modding of isaac
inb4 it gets delayed 7 years
its gonna be bad
prepare to sort thru newest on workshop or whatever nicalis will use
Brace yourselves...doomsday's near.
im gonna make this cool new fun mod, its gonna be a MARIO MUSHROOm and it's gonna mkae you big
Every time Isaac picks up a coin he says a 16khz "MAMA MIA" soundbite ripped from a youtube video with a $2 microphone
Day one will be so bad...

lol
gonna install all 100 day 1 mario ab+ mods
bonzi buddy
mario from mario party
Here we have something I'll never use ever again.
who wouldn't
k
I'd rather own a boar
that's horrifying
Huh.
bore
http://cisr.ucr.edu/images/01_eucalyptus_longhorned_borer_cisr_large.jpg
isn't that boar
what
a borer is a boar caretaker
?
it's an animal
Is borer someone who bores
prove it
I will probably die without ever having used it again
<:bonziNotApproved:255589240732123136>
Borer is a word I've not used once in my life, except in this sentence
Careful there, rebel boy
bad
whoa
that's nuts
im such a rebel
i read borer
boners on the brain
same tbh
I also read boner
Omfg that's incredible
i read that link as barren hairy boner

you're just that eager!
I don't know why I tought today was the 3rd
And the #MadeWithAfterbirthPlus posts on Twitter.
Hm
nothing
practically nil
Only what's in the script samples
no
Have we got any actual info on the API?
it's bad
like
^
yeah honestly tyrone sucks at selling the API
You can say that AB+'s API will be limited but saying it'll be worse than a completely unfinished API with only two lua hooks is just being disingenuous, c'mon now
atleast it has item support ?
oh no it isn't
Yes, but AB+'s API is probably more shit.
thought so
but can u shoot coins at le 4th wall xD
and this API is shit
i hope you all realize that these examples are more in depth than the ones tyrone has been showing
?
NOT BLACK HEART?
WHAT IS THIS SHIT
IS THIS A FUCKING ROTTEN HEART DROPPING
http://i.imgur.com/gzMn71e.png
that's afterbirth
The black hearts don't kill enemies instantly. 0/10
it just gets better
https://gfycat.com/ReliableFaroffFanworms
*shhhhhhh*
it's a coincidence
yeah yeah and the intro plays nutshack
Yeah but Antibirth isn't a paid product (yet)
yeah mudeth is selling the album
or kilburn
Which Antibirth's secret room track borrows the melody from
well neither does mudeth
Because Nicalis doesn't have the rights to Danny's music
^
no lol the new soundtrack will just be removed ?
why?
It just occured to me that if Antibirth ends up becoming official, the secret room music will have to be redone, blegh
Speaking of music
Wow, great timing
~~and ruined them~~
yeah kilburn got remastered versions of the tracks the day before release
It was basement, in one of limt's videos
basement old version still better
basement has
however cellar hasn't changed music wise
that was on a beta build though
Huuuuh
but the API itself was halted
oh no we got the API access a couple weeks ago
That explains why the Antibirth music in one of those videos sounded really unfinished
yeah
Wow, so all of this stuff is well over a year old
the only thing he added recently was the ability to add status effects to enemies after we asked him and he said "that won't take long to do at all"
remember this API is a very old feature that kil stopped working on when ab+ was announced, so it's super barebones right now
you can't get hp yet but that's on the suggestion document
The meme is still going.
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5looh3/when_everyones_talking_about_monstro_and_youre/
The game should check every monster's HP and spawn one black heart for every point of HP they have
balanced imo
oh and make it so that instead of damaging the enemy it just kills it instantly
if you stare at an enemy they should turn into a black heart
pajeet made an aimbot with the API like first day, just combine that with the black heart spawner
every floor is made out of black hearts
afterbirth mod where you play as a black heart shooting black hearts at black hearts
fucking gay
And have the tears each have a 10% chance of spawning a black heart
combine it with the mod that makes black hearts damage
why aren't you playing as a black heart
Make the black hearts shoot tears
there's no instawin button
and shoot
you still have to move
not OP enough tbh
not quite
true
true
It still doesn't spawn as much as Serpent's Kiss.
me likey
there we go
the game isn't really capable of dealing with more black hearts than that
https://gfycat.com/SoreIncomparableAllensbigearedbat
i made one too but it isn't as explodey
though it should probably be reduced to 1 per second or something to balance it, it's probably too annoying to move in a room full of black hearts
Needs more black hearts
https://gfycat.com/GlitteringRealisticIndianrhinoceros
nope
eden did you see my afterbirth.gif?
yeah
:^)
so, it's just afterbirth normally?
yes
this black fly spews out black hearts in every direction
when the room ends it spawns a black fly
oh hell yes
```hook.Add("TriggerRoomClear", function()
      ents.Spawn(TYPE_FLY, 0, Player():GetPos())
  end)

hook.Add("Update", function()
    for i, v in ipairs(ents.QueryType(TYPE_FLY)) do
    ents.Spawn(TYPE_PICKUP, VARIANT_HEART, v:GetPos(), VectorFromAngle(Random(360)):Mul(Random(30)), NullEntity(), SUBTYPE_HEARTBLACK)
  end
end)
```
it's okay guys because i made the best feature of afterbirth
ew
I don't trust dat
that looks 100% disgusting
Chocolate should not be translucent, it looks like it might be sewage water
My idea is that the vending machine for a lot of money would give a random stat up and would only be found in arcades
fucking barf
http://nihonshock.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/chocosoda-bottle.jpg
closest thing i can think of is yoohoo
is chocolate soda even a thing
fizzy lifting drinks
I'd go for it
It beats mine by a milestone
good pills that only last 1 floor
anyway the vending machine seems like a decent idea
else I probably would've just dropped afterbirth and forgot about it
the earlier they announced a modding api the better for me
gets pretty tiresome
I wish people would stop thinking it's cute to use this shitty basement background and this font in all their infographics
So good

and even now we know next to nothing and couldn't even preorder if we wanted

Look
Somebody did a vending machine idea before me and it's soooooooo good
and even still they got the date wrong
and then advertised almost not at all
nicalis announced ab+ so far in advance
good
and yet
I'm so sad
sadly they got a needy community on their back at the game's release
would be neat if devs could just do that
nobody saw it coming
just five days
that was a real blessing
The true best thing about Antibirth is how it wasn't hyped for one year straight
prob
u know he's gonna respond to all the suggestions with "gay tbh"
yeah
i mean the end goal is at least ab+ parity
true
without getting people excited for all features
it's just suggestions though
let's let him take things at his own pace
think of the OP START mods
i mean
hmm
maybe not jer
wait
i'll throw that in now
however we have a google drive document with everything we've been yelling at kilburn to add
I know but you should be able to
soon 
Thank you!
also you can't do that in antibirth's api
afterbirth.gif
and the health limit should be removed
afterbirth
the health bar at the top should be extended to be able to fill the entire screen with enough hearts
```blackheart = ents.Spawn(TYPE_PICKUP, VARIANT_HEART, self:GetPos(), VectorFromAngle(Random(360)):Mul(Random(30)), NullEntity(), SUBTYPE_HEARTBLACK)```
At least I think that was it?
a normal binding of isaac run but everytime damage is dealt or damage is taken black hearts appear on the screen
He posted it above
What does the code look like for that one?
is it new year because these fireworks are great
hahahaha
<@66197463593136128> ???
https://gfycat.com/GlitteringRealisticIndianrhinoceros
true but no ones gonna care about that
I don't believe he ever went back on that
to be fair he was going to make an api in the first place
yeah
kil said it was fine in discord so he has reasons to not be worried
eh who knows what morons will think
Sorta like "uh excuse me, but you don't seem to know kil, he REALLY doesn't like nicalis and in fact he's going to stick it to them by making his own API and backporting everything!!"
whatever
yeah i wasnt feeling this but pajeet was already spamming his tower defense before i had the chance to say that maybe this isnt a good idea
There was some retard on reddit the other day discussing Kilburn's feelings on AB+/Nicalis in a really snobby matter-of-fact way
Well yes but this isn't a private room is what I'm saying
that's why it's FOR DISCORD EYES ONLY
this is why its kept a secret
that's why it isn't on the sub
Just a little concerned that the sub will eventually have a "DAE KILBURN STEALING SPOTLIGHT FROM AB+ WITH HIS OWN API" post
well it's discord knowledge
its awesome
omg its this lmao
the game instantly starts lagging
i made the api clone *any entity that died* twice
Is it though

oh now that the api is "public knowledge" there's something i want to show you guys
its been so long since ive gotten a run without flight in ab
you guys are getting it wrong its flight AND blackhearts
beautiful ? ?
lmao
that's right, obsidian tools
im gonna make a new unique ab+ mod for my first mod
amazing
Y E S
yeah
it's balanced because it will crash the game if you take too long in a room
afterbirth is ported to antibirth
Alright then
https://gfycat.com/SoreIncomparableAllensbigearedbat
oh
I don't feel like it
they really went overboard with black heart spawning and items tht give you black hearts in aftebirth
DO IT
I could mod monstro to spawn 200 dips every time he lands after a big jump
better mod demo than pyromanic or poop monstro
yeah that's what i thoguht
```        if self:GetType() == TYPE_TEAR and self:GetFrameCount() == 0 then
            blackheart = ents.Spawn(TYPE_PICKUP, VARIANT_HEART, self:GetPos(), self:GetVel(), NullEntity(), SUBTYPE_HEARTBLACK)
            self:Remove()
        end
        if self:GetSubType() == SUBTYPE_HEARTBLACK then
            local enemies = ents.GetAll()
            for i, en in ipairs(enemies) do
                if en:IsVulnerableEnemy() then
                    if (self:GetPos()-en:GetPos()):Length() < 30 then
                        en:TakeDamage(1)
                    end
                end
            end
        end```
apply an aoe damage to the black hearts
destroy the tears
spawn black hearts with their velocity
you just iterate over tears
so limt
probably
It must have been a very fun bridge for all of my friends to do it

difference is, you dont go around making said bad sprites and posting them everywhere saying IM PREPARING FOR AB+ ?
I zoomed in on it, and that is actually bad

it's sad when you're the guy who looks at all these sprites that are being mocked and say "that's better than I could do"

how many "isaac is minibosses" mods do we need
i'll totally do it
isaac shooting black hearts
now what meme is this of all memes
oh my god
nvenc
that'd be a good mod
make isaac shoot black hearts instead of tears
once nvenc is updated yeah i'll record footage

so that's 30 black hearts a second
cool dawg
it spawns a full black heart every time the game updates
im just gonna remain positive and hope I can do an enjoyable amount of coding by tomorrow, time is running out and I'm about to make a paper mario dating sim
okay afterbirth mod is done
? ?
? ?
? ?
???
Appa don't
? ??
sucks
if they screw up the modding api I really will hate them but for now I've got no reason
Ipecac, Ab+, ice cream...
My brain has A LOT of things bothering me
same
¯\_(?)_/¯
my brain is full of ab+ hate rn
ew
i *never* said otherwise...
true i guess
she didn't say otherwise
wtf ein
balance that ice
you're making it for antibirth winter stop fooling people
granted until I joined this discord I barely looked at the community or the game for that matter
i'll make a good mod with balance! and ice! ?
```
where as the actual current modders have no hope for ab+
```
hey, I managed a decent amount on my own in a week learning executable modding and I'm oblivious to this nicalis hate train
from the look of it he's still gone nowhere
and no one would be any the wiser
holy shit that guys still making his gamemaker platformer with isaac sprites i thought he would go nowhere wit hthat shit
lol you could just link to the previous one
no one will suspect a god damn thing
i can just download the image of an older shitpost
actually i dont even need to do that
nothings stopping me from going into my afterbirth file selecting and making tihs exact same shitpost
oh wow, so thrilling to see that yet another person put a lot of time into this game
like come the fuck on
1001% posts were never interesting at any point ever, except for the very first one
atleast i can make fun of bad sprites
worst type of shitpost
true
fuck em to hell
fuck all the people posting "JUST IN TIME FOR AB+ 1001%" posts
that's what they get for having 0 community outreach
also let me just say
gj nicalis
yeah that's about how it is
its so fucking funny to me on that like the DAY BEFORE ab+ everyone on the sub is like IM GONNA MAKE A MOD  and they have no modding talent whatsoever, where as the actual current modders have no hope for ab+
we can help you with the lua
make an original thing!
If the api is too confusing
I think bou won't continue probably
sorry to hear that
OpieOP
Argh tbh I didn't even research lua so
Those'll be the first mods I make in AB+
if nicalis used their own balance system then you could make all the *somewhat* powerful items you wanted as long as they were more rare so you only got a couple on one run
Has someone compiled all of the NL "first mad i'll make in afterbirth plus"es?
beat me to the joke
ye
dieseas
Pajeets toe
?
mom's toe: range up
balance
im gonna add an item that has a 100% chance of spawning in every single room that turns all hearts into spirit hearts
give me ten minutes
i'll make an afterbirth mod right now in the antibirth api
Isaac mod, the chest spawns first room
better idea
you know what
OR ELSE I WONT PLAY
make sure to give atleast 1 black heart every room
we wouldn't need to add any utility items anyway if nicalis just used their fucking item weight system properly
oh true
ok
Black hearys = Balance
doesnt matter cause anyone using it would download 500 op item mods
black hearts are utility after all ?
yes
Black hearts
because i happen to care about balance
that's why if i make a mod it's going to have interesting *and* utility items
and spawn black hearts in some way
20/20/20: triples your shots with no downside
DAMAGE UP 5 BLACK HEARTS
they also must all have damage ups
TRUUUUUUUUU
DAMAGE UP
everybody wants to make interesting items
nobody wants to make "hp up"
another thing that won't be done right is balance like you just mentioned
the only ideas I have literally ever come up with for games have been taking ideas from other games
?
DAE MINECRAFT ITEM SPRTIES xdddddd
yeah I definitely fear that most of the popular isaac mods will be OP trash
yeah
what mods do i get
it's a double outline and simple shading, easypsy

you have to have shit items as well as the cool new ones
well faux check the pinned messages, there's a five minute isaac sprite tutorial
I pay you in hugs
a important design thing in isaac is dont make every new item you make op as fuck
isaac sprites, as simple as they are, are messed up so much
that's what design means, come up with good ideas which aren't trash
code for me
I'll work it out
it's strange
I just wanna code
learn how to design really fast
I can't come up with ideas
thought you meant isaac sprites ?
I can't sprite
ah
well I can't design
<@66197463593136128> for some of my own game tinkering projects
ye
the most important part
Judging time!
all you fuckers are forgetting *design*
do you have any sprites faux?
i can sprite but not code, i dont have many ideas currently tho
ahead of the game
we'll see about that
B)
I can code and sprite, baby, I'm gonna just crush it
he cuts you and gets your money
how do i unpack
cutter dark bum
nothing wrong with any type of cute bum
i can code and i can *kinda* sprite
¯\_(?)_/¯
cuter dark bum
same
but
help me unpack too
I have no ideas but I can code (not sprite tho)
if you plan to repost compilations like that, be sure to get the creators' permissions
okay good
don't worry
unless nicalis fucked up really badly you can stack them
?
I have a bunch of mod ideas i just can't sprite and or code
cause I'd like to make like, small mods with like a set of 5 or so items or something like that
our lives will be an abject nightmare if not
so what i think this guy is doing is getting like png images of isaacs sprite of the internet and not bothering getting the proper scale and crudely drawing in paint
it would be really dumb if you couldn't
i don't see why not
ffs
dont post it
does anyone know if you can pile mods up onto each other?
make it
If you have a mod idea
at least make your own shitty mod
same tbh
I downvote any big 'mod idea' shitposts without reading
give me the ~~succ~~ AB+
and too little good modders
Too many mod ideas
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5lobef/afterbirth_idea_images_of_nightmare_a_mod_idea/  this sounds edgy as fuck
now that you mention it i recognize the name
^^^^
i unironically used that in the early days
you made that?
shit bar
wait holy shit
i remember that
ew
i went to look for it lol
I got sweet sweet 300 karma by posting this trash edit http://imgur.com/a/KIQWj
when ab+ comes out it's gonna suck to have standards
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/123961790529929218/265293382954385408/Basement_Boss_Bar.jpg
pleaaseee
yeah like i said
no
pls
make that mod

im missusing my new mod rights intensively ?
mobile
honestly it doesn't matter because generally the isaac community is easy to please with shitty sprites
I'm on monile ;-;
Whats the pin
?
probably should've pinned that sooner
quality pin wof
"here's the boss bar i made" "oh it sucks" "WELL FUCK YOU I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD"

oh my god that fucking ugly ass anime shit got 600 upvotes
posted leathers video, too ! ?
i went to that spriters profile
exactly
omg
Yeah it expresses tragedy
it expresses that you have poor taste
comic sans is an expressive font
where did that comic sans come from
set up a bot that links the leather video to everyone who posts their shitty ab+ sprites
can the subreddit owners like
no u
u took it too far
>comic sans
wtf???
?

Fix your english tbh
not harse enough imo
lol
harse
inb4 2 harse
``They sorta looked like they were crudely drawn, and dont really fit the style of isaac at all. you should probably practice mor epixel art because these are very crude and sloppily drawn. also they look too big for isaac item sprites, try using other items as comparisions``
Didn't work with Ipecac :|
hah what's up with modders
probably not tho
if more people say it maybe it'll get to their head
you can comment too
portal said somet
o
They sorta looked like they were crudely drawn, and dont really fit the style of isaac at all. you should probably practice mor epixel art because these are very crude and sloppily drawn
*actually helpfull*
But that's like
inb4 toxic
http://i.imgur.com/0FtqX42.png
they savevd it as jpg first then resaved as png
as new items
I can't wait for the modding api so I can make shitty sprites all day
dont underestimate the subreddits ability to make something truly shit
this png image even has jpeg artifacts !?! how is that even possible ?
well they *are* asking what we think
its so bad, myy eyes bleed a bit
im still deciding if i should comment on that reddit post of not
you know which ones i'm talking about
let's not go too crazy here
it's better than the other ones
Looks worse than the Ipecac sprites

Guys, watch me expose <@66197463593136128>.
hey guys rockcock69 here

and make a monstro mod! ?
i think kilburn should scrap antibirth...
xD!
Wow, editing is cool.
wow you can edit

and this item basically guarantees that you can't beat Mega
How much do you wanna bet that the bug with charmed monsters bugging out mega satan isn't fixed
Best would be "A charmed Larry Jr. appeared!" but it only spawns one body part of him
its propapbly because stupid people would interpret it as "spawining an enemy"

it summons one of those
can it summon non-charmed enemies?
you know those little background particles that look like flies
why did they see it nessicary to add "charmed"...
"a charmed black fly has appeared!"
the worst thing would be
wait no...
what if a charmed spider appeared...
lol...
WE NEED TO MAKE IT FIGHT SOME MORE
MY SPIDER'S ONLY LVL 2
A CHARMED LVL 2 SPIDER APPEARED !
charmed to meet you
A CHARMED APPEARED
that enemy doesn't actually have a proper name...
what if it summoned a charmed black globlin's body
crazy long legs*
D SMALL BABY LONG LEGS F*
D SMALL BABY LONG LEGS A
of course it doesn't
A CHARMED SMALL BABY LONG LEGS APPEARED! doesnt even fit in that name tag bar !! fuck you nicalis
a charmed gut has appeared!
a charmed charm has appeared
charmed monstro meme
charmed charleston chews
charmed charleston

yes
*a charmed small crazy long legs
yes
a single charmed ring fly
yeah
charmed white bat
oh
*A CHARMED SMALL BABY LONG LEGS APPEARED*
yeah
you need to do
red mobile host isn't even the worst example <@167363485326508033>
that's a weird crop job
wew
I know you do
more like Afterbirth- because it's the + but cropped get it
Now you're just being silly
a charmed yellow champion red mobile host has appeared!
oh no not an app
~~Technically that sorta happens when Jacob & Esau fight a super sin miniboss~~
A-
yeah

IV bag
There already are IVs.
there needs to be levels and ivs and shit like that
yeah
changing graphics does not go to the level I am willing to go
how would we get that great leather voice?
if we add a new pill, or card...
It's called Friendly Ball + changing graphics.
hey killllburnnnnn! ?
You can already do that.
except you can only battle steelix
nah I just learned I wanna turn binding of isaac into pokemon, better idea
And his digestive system
limt only eats wood though since eating steel hurts the environment.
incubate it into a steelix
eat it
recreate minecraft in antibirth lua when
What would you do with the steel?
but all you can mine is steel
i want to add mining
ill do rune sounds
fine
how dare you
nothing replaces leather
;-;
you don't replace leather
that's not possible
nevermind
no
you can do that already lol
Please no
yeah that's possible
And repleace leather
Is make my own pill sounds
everything is gay to you
i'm gay
therefore greetings are gay
The one thing I wanna do in antibirth API
True.
they're gay
nothing
what's wrong with furless cats
hello o/
greetings are like furless cats
same! ?
He hasn't had his daily penis.
ohhh
im gay
why does kilburn keep greeting us in these odd ways
hay
hay
i will use this to blackmail you
hay tbh
http://i.imgur.com/h8Zbn9x.png
please
Add C++ support so I can add a virus to your game.
yes
hai
hi kilburn! ?
Yes.
yes
h*ck you portal!!!!!!!
are we talking about antibirth lua
go develop discord
i fucking hope they didnt copy paste MY itempool editor. i was ask to send a link to it to nicalis but after i did that, he never texted back -.-
and I say shut the h*ck!!!!!!!
FUCK OFF LUKE
what
well Im a beta tester before either of u were
not now!!!
<@167363485326508033>
shout at kil enough and he'll add support im sure
I'm a double beta tester
eh I'm not gonna complain, if I find limits I like seeing what I can do with them
so i know what i'm talking about
yea pretty much
not just "okay new api perfect"
Lua is a balance
well i'm a beta tester too
Yeah exactly limt lmao
so he would add whatever was needed to the lua
fuck you jerry i'm a beta tester i know what i'm talking about
however kilburn actually cares what modders would want to do with that lua
but its also why it is bad
fuck you portal i'm a beta tester i know what i'm talking about
yeah lua, no thingeroos
it limits
thats why Lua is good
yeah
like viruses and thingeroos
ab+ has steam trading cards as a tag even tho dlcs cant add more cards smh
I think the way kilburn put it was that allowing C++ would open up possibilities to bad shit
Nicalis can't CnD
i wouldnt be so sure, jerry
using C++ may be possible but not as supported
The best part
i'm sure there will be a c++ option later down the road
it's for free
nothing
how much is it
being able to choose to mod in C++ would be neat but that might be asking too much (?)
the lua api has been in dev since before ab+ but kil postponed it after ab+ was announced
ye
Will antibirth api be released
and it works!
yeah pretty much
the lua is intended to make things easier for modders
But couldn't you do more in C++?
c++ is low level
hell yeah
correct
yes
well yeah
yeah if ab+ api will disappoint you'll always have antibirth api
So Antibirth is made in C++, but Kilburn made a Lua API?
it has a great and very complete api, just not a robust LUA api yet
~~will the modding api for antibirth be called antibirth+~~
OH MY GOD they re-added the community remix half heart half spirit heart no why that was one of the dumbest features of remix
well I've got no worries then
just not complete
ye its swanky
oh, no I didn't see
tyrone: download a bunch of those moddingofisaac mods real quick for the screenshots to make it look like there's content
its just not released yet
did u not see earlier that antibirth has an api
and if the modding API is a failure well I'll just go back to learning executable modding I guess
Antibirth API coming soon
it reminds me of the zeeky h bomb from that shitty old flash movie
I'm personally more interested in AB+ than Antibirth just because I wanna code
lmao
some mod they downloaded from moddingofisaac last night
oh shit the bomb
The mouth
nicalis fucking up is one of the three constants in life
wtf
wtf is that ugly ass bomb item in the screenshotes
i just want ab+ to be a failure
Well, of course the DLC of a DLC won't have as many players as the original DLC.
meanwhile, humans breathe air!
they blew it!
they fucked it up!
certainly wont match afterbirths
i doubt the AB+ numbers will be big
yeah but like
AB+ numbers will probably be better than Antibirth numbers just because it is an offficial expansion.
tfw my steam is slow for no reason
i wonder how ab+ numbers will be like
no i have not done hello world
My b 7k
tbh
yeah
2 at the most
ab+ would probably increase the player count by like
i mean
<@131576903722074112> have you done hello world yet
And increasing
Antibirth has increased the average daily player amount of Rebirth by 5k
Would just like to point out
baah I can't wait a whole day for this mod api to come out, I've been code deprived for far too long, I need something to code
cause the ab+ store page was added?
Why did rebirth update?
Last Record Update
about an hour ago (January 2, 2017  21:08:38 UTC)
it would be nice, however, if co-op could be made true with the mod api (seriously tyrone please)
cause isaac is such a dead game they resort to that for sales
nicalis is just tag spamming
afterbirth does as well so it's beh
And Co-op as well as Local co-op
That's probably nicalis being stupid
yeah we noticed
Or does the side bar say Multiplayer as well as Local Multiplayer
or make one with the mod API
Is it just me
Guis
Uhmmm
¯\_(?)_/¯
thats assuming the creator will update it to ab+
If it's compatible.
Just disable it and use normal MissingHUD.
it's too large and cluttered
yup
We already know that.
ewww the missinghud used looks awful
http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/570660/header.jpg?t=1483379789
well yeah I said "bad api" but it wouldn't be bad it'd be horrible, I at least trust anyone making a serious mod api to allow for that functionality
i want to see this shit for myself
But you can't purchase it.
Yes.
wait is the ab+ store page already up or what
?
??
>
?
<
?
^^^^^^^^^
?
reee limt
the api would have to have basically no features at all if you can't even do that
^
^
^
like it's extremely simple
^
^
it would be next to impossible for that to not be doable
^
^
^
honestly if we can't it's a bad api
why add it with the right key press when you can add it with the up key press
We don't know that yet.
but yeah with the api you could simply add a jump velocity with the right key press
enough to propel you vs the downward gravity
is it not shitty if it's unplayable
relative shitton
well
well not a shit ton
if you jumped like that item works in any platformer it would be completely unplayable
Just make an item that increases your upwards velocity by a shitton
It's the closest thing to jumping.
if it always goes up then it's good enough
in a shitty platformer it'd be perfect
nothing like jumping in a good platformer
how to jump is nothing like jumping in a platformer at all
wrong
or maybe bloat mode in the original game
How To Jump + crawlspace
a hideously shitty platformer yeah
you could do that without the api
unless I can use the LUA API to turn the game into a platformer like I have with other LUA APIs it's not good enough
blame them for picking like the worst time for a release date
by the look of the store page you might think the whole dlc was thrown together in a week
**Can't preorder like all the other DLCs**
I wanted at least one example of "making a completely new game" with the API.
the store page tells jack shit
well nicalis is run by an abject crackpot
yeah finn thats really odd
(civ mods are also simple. New civilization mod is only a XML files and arts)
Tyrone made that very clear early on so I doubt he'll be going back on it
I can't believe it's less than 24 hours to release, and we still know next to nothing.
a 'day' left
@portal-chan~~ kawaii uguu desu ?#4871 Mods aren't coming to console other than what is introduced in patches, and even THAT'S up in the air
yeah, a day left
we will see
and creating some terrible mod amalgam
ab+ mods will likely be simple enough to install that it wont make a difference i guess
with ab+ you're presumably meant to be installing and trying out 3 small mods a day
well the model is very different
You know, after downloading A LOT mods to Civ and EuIV, I like manual installation more than Steam Workshop installation
to allow console to use mods maybe???
i think they might use some bethesda.net like meme
You'd rather have an external site with manual installation?
Why don't you want Steam Workshop?
please no Steam Workshop
donwold
downwoad mods
im shocked ! why is there no workshop support indicator on rebirth & ab+ steam websites ????? i dont want to download mods from platinumgod again -.-

the subreddit's going to have a lot of action making bad mods
i dont think that is has that much 'action'
but why does it have action as tag
?
ok
no
No
yes
are you sure..?
giant troll
^
why would we do that
can we please all give ab+ the tag 'female protagonist'
just finished ??? unlocks time for another character, whats this item... oh...
ok
I want a mod which, instead of having a random chance to apply 1 curse for the floor, has a random chance to remove 1 curse and normally you have all curses all the time
brick-force
no

true

i agree
already better than lua
say no more
>!= as ~=
+=,-=,*=,/=,%= operators, a lite implementation of lambda expression syntax and maybe(not really necessary imo) != as ~= alias
whats good about moonscript
from the documentation given i like some of the stuff it does but absolutely hate some other stuff it does.
¯\_(?)_/¯
not a fan of coffeescript either so
it says it's heavily inspired by coffeescript(JS dialect)...
looks like one of those weird meme languages with odd hard getting used to syntaxes
looking it up
a lua dialect
so no
i dont know what moonscript is
did anyone around here ever try programming with moonscript?
no one should make or play it
that looks like a painful challenge...

2017's gonna be the best year
good ol antibirth lua api
antibirth has an api
WHAT IN THE NAME OF FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO BOMBS

i really hope that ab+ has some type of console

Can we just get a mod that shows what life is like for Mulligans. Like some Stanley Parrable shit?

Instead of little blue isaacs, Hush spits out multiple Lil Haunts
just explode into 15 hushes
Needs more Haunt
I can also show off horrible stupid bullshit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03gcTpXing
is there some way that i can prevent items from changing the design of isaac
hey fuk u
<@128874748041101312> yours shows the extent of what basic math can do, but sure I guess
Then wasting my days away getting good at Defense Grid
<@145740433165647873> tbh yours shows that you can do cool stuff with it and mine shows the extent of what it can do
I remember passing time in computer classes playing Onslaught 2.1 on playr.co.uk

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG_CMbw8_Nc
yes
you're the one who told me to shill
antibirth gets an api too?
Dont shill without me
antibirth is planned to have its own lua support in an update later
so mods can work with antibirth?
it's antibirth
it's not ab+
what's baby plum doin in AB+?
weird edgy bird thing
not my problem
i can only watch one at a time geez
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbAA_ccPig
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1KJ7YYbCWg
better than ?
it will be when it's enabled
is the api any good?
I never disabled it
that's a test mod
*Melon green
green basement OP
<@145740433165647873> Why did you make the walls and floor of basement light green?
nice
oh
oh you know, the antibirth lua api
https://gfycat.com/IncredibleFoolhardyBaldeagle
tbh

melon what is that from
Which is pretty contrasty to the brown
They're all blue
like half of it is random blue pixels rather than a solid line
I still am incapeable of comprehending what about it is unreadable.
I forget how binning of isek's healthbar looked but I bet even that was more readable
>:^[
i fixed your hp bar :^)

But does it stop flying enemies?
wow, AB+ is so robust! :^)
oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Tg451LFIY
Though, I'm still confused about what's unpleasant about it to look at.
That's simple
you can't tell if it's part or not
I can fix that bit
the blue on that end is confusing
See
aside from all that its not pleasant to look at
Lol
triggers me even more
then the bar isnt centered
It's simply decorative
Doesn't obscure anything

Neither end of the bar obscures anything
I had assumed most people played the game long enough at the point of modding that they could, more or less, accurately figure just how many increments they take off per shot after a few shots?
the beginning of the bar being obscured is the main problem
yes.
Do you really need to see such a small amount of the health bar on the basement?
by not displaying 100% of the health bar
oh my god
In what way?
But worse
Which it still does
ui is  supposed to give information
no
That was the whole point
But it's supposed to be themed :V
you obscure information with your sprite
hahah he's still going
if this information is sacrificed for "theme" or "style" that defeats the point of it
Yes
it gives information to the player
Yes
a health bar is an UI element
In what way?
the fucking health bar
What isn't readable?
And I don't understand the "readable" issue.
you can figure out ways to add detail while still keeping it readable
you can still have rope and shit
Doesn't look like it'd be fun to make :c
well it's still lumpy
And yet it's more readable than yours
That just looks boring though
see how the bar part is uniterrupted?
here's a shitty 10 minute example, but it should get the point across
Ok ?
this works for me
Or a png with a transparency?
sure why not
yeah sure
BESIDES JPEG
Erm... Can I send it through discord?
lol the psd
any file type
Do you want a PSD or something?
At least, for the rest of them
It'd be easier to adapt if I have a visual example
Mhm
can you offer us the sprite to edit so we can show you an example?
well all i've visualized is a bad sprite
Reverting it to something else would be difficult
I can't make something I haven't already visualized
you can always change it back
besides, art's all about iteration
could turn out pretty nice looking
why not try making the change?
thiojoe
Why would it be?
No
is this a parody account?
It's simply how it developed.
Given there is no inherent reason for the alphabet to be in some arbitrary order.
lol
I'm not understanding the comparison, Melon.
anyways
i can try! ?
"why can't I just say G after E? it rhymes, I don't understand"
nobody can
I can't name them out of order very quickly, though. I'm not so organized.
there isn't a "make good sprite" song unfortunately
there's an alphabet song though
English is and always has been my best subject.
how long did it take you to memorize the alphabet as a kid?
I sincerely don't understand.
I'm not just being sarcastic
:l
They don't like it because it's bad
I don't understand, though.
"Hey guys I made this thing"
"I don't like it"
"Yeah well _I_ like it, jeez I don't get why you're getting so defensive over this"
What's wrong with my attitude?
defending why it's shit
if anything you seem like the salty one here
it's your pointless attitude which is irritating
That's your right
I said it's okay if you don't like it and say you don't like it.
i don't understand why you're so salty about criticism
just gaze at it
I don't understand why you people are so salty about a picture <.>
at this point yeah
What the fuck do you want us to do, just look at it but not acknowledge it at all
can't argue with that
So be it.
but what if someone hunts you down and stabs you because it's a poor mod?
I didn't ask for feedback?
^
Then stop asking for feedback :v
Why not?
then why are you showing it on a public server
I don't care if people download it, though?
But please keep it out of here if you're not going to listen to anyone
If you're content in making a mediocre mod that no one will voluntarily download because it looks like a big fat nasty piece of trash, then go for it
:v
hey tyrone
"There are thousands of shit mods made every day, all the cool kids are doing it so why can't I?"
this is what you said to yourself when making afterbirth
?
oh i see you're tyrone
I just make it
It's not really my concern whether it fits or doesn't?
what
Why would I want to not be one of them?
I don't understand that phrase, flotilla.
100s of mods that don't fit yeah but *do you want to be one of them*
millions of shits are taken every day, doesn't mean you have to be one of them
I mean, there are literally 100s of mods that don't fit?
and i fail to see how it doesn't make sense if we're giving you pointers to fix it
the critique is that *it doesn't fit*
But I don't understand the critique in the first place. It makes no sense to me.
bin 2 win
If you're just gonna pull the "Well **I** think it's fine" card any time someone gives you pointers or criticism then you might as well just throw your mod in the trash right now
Do what?
do your eyes do that by default in real life?
There's a difference between making things for yourself and being a dense fuck who can't accept legitimate critique
I'm not not accepting criticism <.> I don't understand the criticisms
What did I do that was obtuse?
well there's a difference between doing that and not accepting criticism
"I feel like you're the kind of people who make things FOR other people and I'm the kind who makes things because I can or just want to." oh my god
if all you want to do is show things to people there are less obtuse methods
Can I not make things for myself and show others at the same time?
how many chromosomes do you have?
I don't understand the connection, melon.
i'm out
i give up
Yes
but you're "doing it for yourself"
and yet here you are posting often publically in this channel
I didn't say that
you want people to download it
so let me get this straight
So it's getting muddled in between us
I feel like you're the kind of people who make things FOR other people and I'm the kind who makes things because I can or just want to.
?
i give up
ugh
not this sprite
Duct tape fixes everything
if anything the duct tape makes it look even more like it's sloppily thrown together
YEh
IT's tear blue :V
one tiny little patch of duct tape lol
I can hide those, though?
why the ugly blue
how the hell does *duct tape* fit with basement
because theres like 3 visibile pixels on the left
like
if you wanted to make the overlay make the bar just a little bit thinner then that would be one thing but it's sort of slopped all over it
it looks like it was patched together
How can you not tell where it ends on the left?
it doesn't look like an isaac sprite at all
too sloppy
There are ropes and shit blocking it and you can't even tell where it fucking ends on the left
it looks too detailed
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205854782542315520/265535629620674561/unknown.png
its obstructed by your shitty overlay
It is most certainly fucking not
aside from that it doesnt look like an isaac sprite
its not
<.>
It is
^^^
the health bar should be fully visible
there are plenty of issues with this  that by definition prevent it from fitting isaac style
maybe eventually someone will agree with you and you'll have found your soul mate
That's okay
well everyone else here doesn't
I think it fits the style and that it looks nice, though.
because it doesn't look good
we're pointing out that it doesn't look good
I don't even care how it looks, I care that depending on where my health is I can't tell the boss' HP at a glance
try some omega 3 supplements
SImply that I am incapeable of understanding what you're trying to point out.
it's not pleasant nor does it fit isaac style
its simply not pleasant to look at
but if everyone else does?
does it not concern you that you don't see issues which apparently everyone else sees clear as day?
It's not that I'm denying what you're saying or disregarding it, myself.
you may not see the issues
It's you
If you disregard the same consistent critique given to you by like 4-5 different people, then those people aren't the issue
I simply don't see the issues you point out.
well if you disregard criticism you'll go nowhere
but one is useful and the other is asinine
One can just as easily disregard criticism as they can accept it.
maybe you should join an optometry discord
did you look at it very hard?
I looked at the basement
i see no point in posting a progress report for something and not taking criticism
I did
typically if you want to make a replacement for some of the art in isaac, you look at some of the art in isaac for reference
i have to agree with everyone else here
I didn't?
So don't take it personally when people do
I never said you can't :V
its fucking garbage looking
because it is
and can we not say that its shit?
It's implicit that you're posting your mod stuff here to get critique and feedback, not to have people circlejerk about how epic for the win it is
What do you mean? One of the things in the top is "Creation" I can post it just because I created it can't I?
I mean if you want to waste everyone's time including your own by posting updates to your mod which you'll accept 0 critique over then knock yourself out but don't pretend that's just what people do
are you actually this dense or are you just being stubborn?
Not simply critique
It says it's for various things
that's obvious to most sane people
that's what the channel is for
Why not?
Yeah why the fuck are you posting here if not to get critique??
Because this is a mod
then why are you on a public modding channel?
I make it because I can
Couldn't care less
yeah I presume that you actually intend people to download your mod, right?
UI elements have to be easily-readable at a glance above *all else*
<@149075929283428352> When a bunch of different people are telling you that it obstructs too much of the bar, it obstructs too much
looked thematically appropriate
Wouldn't really say it looked anything. It was just there.
nice lookin skull
It was a skull
the skull looked nice though
yes but it's still real thin near the end!
It doesn't actually cover any visible health
That replaces the skull on the default health bar
Nope
and the whole of the end bit...
its just annoying as shit to look at
The only part obstructed in that tiny bit in the center
this looks shit.
It doesn't obstruct much of it at all tho
only to look awful
for no fucking reason
But that's subjective
this obstructs the health bar way more than needed
that's arguable, but it doesn't function as pleasing to the eyes
ok honestly
It begins and ends where the default health bar ends
But it functions properly as a health bar
Nothing is perfect
guess it's perfect and we just didn't realize
The head end that has the covering replaces the head end of the default health bar where the skull covers
oh alright
That is the aim of health bar, so I am incapeable of seeing any issue.
You can clearly see how much health the boss has left
The ass end of the health bar is obvious
The head end of the healthbar is obvious
So... Remove all theming
the health bar should still be vaguely health bar shaped
Hell, you can still have the rope/tape if you keep the ends distinct
Remove the rope and the tape and make the end of the bars distinct
yeah it would be better if it were more good
Not a fan of how so much of the bar is being blocked off by visual fluff at all
I added some Duct Tape and Ropes to my Basement themed boss bar. I think this is the final product.
Okay. I like the heretic mod
Yes
i hope my sugoi cosplay will make it into the credits! ?
jesus that star platinum sprite fuckin sucked
its like a 2 frame animation running at 30 fps
2 much movement to read the names
and the music blasts your ears off
they are downright unreadable
the credits look awful in general
one more bad thing afterbirth added
Well
yes
wasn't that guy in anime suit was added in afterbirth
yeah lets just break the whole artstyle and put in your sugoi cosplay we dont care anymore
me neither
i will never get over how the fuck this got into the game
Fucking BlazBlue
of a dev wearing a weeb costume
a png image
they already got away with a developer in the credits wearing an anime costume
I'm glad Ed is a decrepit old man who was probably too old for even DBZ
ye
The last thing isaac needs is a jojo reference
the updated vvversion is just tos with less content lol
i think i redownloaded right when you shortly made it public again
the ti tlescreen took SOOOO many updates to get it the way i wanted
prob a old shit outdated version
i still have it
yeah  no way to since i deleted it after i ruined it
So there's no actual way of playing it now ?
sorry im just getting nostalgic over the mod
newgrounds
http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/351701  fucking of isaac titlescreen song this probably makes pm2k nostalgic
what does it even do
yeh he star platinium don't even have legs
too big
^
yeah this is fucking horrible
I don't like the look of that
that doesnt fit isaac
*is this a jojo reference*
so ?
well that looks awful to me
probably the only idea in there that looks good to me
ew
so i saw this on the isaac subreddit
well you def dont wanna see how fucking sloppy the animation xml file is
the title theme instantly plays in my head
god i fucking love this
i dunno
http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/387669574549932756/F0B3152F0E1C8761AA0EBAFBB5CDB24B81F3C671/  i think this one was the proper contrast one
oh well
?
i dunno
yes you did
ii misread
ooh
^ samuel
??
yes
what'd made you eventually split it into its own mod then?
i didnt want to make a new mod at the time so i just kept updating the old one
It looks pretty nice!
ah
basically i slowly turned it into tale of samuel so it got rid of the funny parts
how'd you ruin it?
oh well fucking of isaac was fun to make but i ruined it later on
o
i stole the tree sprites from hm2
but more blue tho
ye
i think?
thats the point
it reminds me of hotline miami
outdated one
ok

^
i cant take you seriously anymore  you first tried porting antibirth to mac and now you have a sans picture
same
Oh wait, wrong channel
So I have an odd issue
remove godmode
cause it looks like godmod
its genuinely fucking cool imo
Is it a parody of godmode ?
*raise the contrast*
took me weeks to animat e the trees looping background
?
so bright

a piece of shit thats what
What's reahated ?
¯\_(?)_/¯
atleast they proved that they can somehow make something worse than reheated
hey
the only "shitmod" allowed in the community is mine
go port antibirth to mac
the title screen is probs still my fav part
but i still wouldnt play it
not much
its basically random sound effects from inside jokes
I never even saw footage
pm2k liked it
eeeh i found it a bit amusing ngl
with isaac
oh well that probably sucked idk
ye
yes
i think appa is talking about fucking of isaac
i made fucking of isaac
Of course BOuh is the only person to defend it
to make it fit
no
if you actually made the spirte
appa you actually put time and effort into samuel
It could be cool
we have enough ~~and i used to be part of the problem~~
you need a sense of humor to pull it off
the community already has it covered
yeah don't do that
this is me making a shitmod
this would be crossing the line even for ed id say
if this is you trying then you have my condolences
Yeah only Ed can do that
you cant just throw random unfunny memes everywhere
yeah this isnt trying
did you try????
but
Is this trying though
very unfunny
fuck me
i dont know why I even try
fuck it
alright I'm definitely never downloading anything you ever make
this is worse than the ab+ stream
not funny
unfunny

i'm interested
I can show you some screenshots
you're not really selling it to me here
*i suppose*
its incomplete but that doesn't stop it from being still the worst
should I make a zip of the current state of my shitmod for you guys to view
gay tbh
XD True
only thing that can save ab+ at this point
I'll be upset if it isn't
Afterberts needs to be included in ab+
award
afterbertz shoulda won the WOAAAAAAAAAAAAH DUDE
XD
imagine if a 1 year old made an isaac mod
im just gonna explain it easily
if you download **NOW**, you get future updates in an utterly unfinished beta state that nobody wants or cares about!
yes
better than gta v graphics
i dont remember
isnt it the most complete graphical overhaul or smth
Afterberts is something amazingly beautiful
I think afterberts really pushes creators to make mods better graphically
XD
aferberts is good game it has nice graphix antibirth is gay
download tale of samuel
pm2k stop shilling
what's afterberts?
XD
I saw gameplay of afterberts
Antibirth is slowing my computer down. It's sad really, because I really like it
agony is good (for a non-"exe mod" obviously)
it sorta pushes the limits of currently possible entity editing
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1423/the-binning-off-isek-aferberts
yeah
agony is good for what it is
working on the antibirth update right now
i recommend my own mod
Thanks. Does anyone know if the agony of isaac is any good?
yessa i knawo the acreator a lunggfa nasdadf I recaomend IT
try it if you want
i suppose the heretic mod's gotten some praise here
Does anyone know wny mods besides antibirth that are actually good to play?
New boss fight confirmed
Like a monstro switching places with another monstro?
can somebody make a mod that changes the look of monstro everytime he jumps up in the air
shading is very frucking important
that and
Thanks
also try to make a sketch first
three pixel thick outlines
I'm just gonna see what I can do from scratch... Anybody got any Boss portrait tips?
so it's no-effort with effort
thats true but its a sprite made from scratch
super sloth is still heavily based off of a globlin with eyes!
Huh another good point
super sloth isnt a recolor either iirc
?
Thanks
Good point
Yeah
even if only to inprove
Kk
yes
So should I still try to redo it?
Sloth equals laziness
Because it makes much more sense for it to be a resprite
well the people on the sub are fucking retarded
Soooo people on reddit don't want me to redo my Bob boss

i also have an item that does a thing, what a coincidence
fun indeed
fun

what do they do?
all of them in order

sure
does anyone wanna see a bunch of recolors
Jus gonna drop these here


Poop colored doesn't look too clear
No idea why they changed it in afterbirth and fucked up boss bar mods
Eh. I just need to get someone who can revert the boss bar handling back to the way rebirth did it
Mehbe
maybe burning basement glow effect or poop colored ?
Also first floor Haunt cuz fuck it
Cuz basement
I thought either Tear Blue or Piss Yellow
I'm undecided on a color
why is it light blue ?
Started work on my mod to give each floor a themed boss bar. Just finished Basement.
It's *all* in squares..
...
yes
By "squares" do you mean the pixels?
thats why i use gimp
weird
The glow won't round off. I tried the eraser and the paint brush but it just does it in squares
you should round off the glow
it looks a bit square to me
I was thinking that. I'm looking at the contract from below for reference
peadith's is a good example! ?
(the world here btw)
I still feel like the shading is a lil bit off
the shading could be a bit better though!
good start
yeah!
I'd say this looks pretty decent
here's how'd i do it, if you want some help
Thanks for the help!
a little too transparent on the inner glow lines! ?
okay. This is probably getting annoying but I believe this may be it
;v

He made a speed boost item into butter  (not finished but almost)
My boyfriend and I are working on a retexture mod for ourselves
^
make it more transparent!
yes <@70946604139425792>
I'm trying to make a glow. It's going a little good and a little bad
Can items be partially transparent like that?
This looks better than before
i'm installing it as we speak
its great
***OH.***
paint.net
paint.net! ?
also if you draw over a transparent pixel twice on accident, it makes it less transparent!
seriously what does pdn mean
meanwhile me like "what is this alien language"
because the alpha is kinda weird in pdn
it's not really...
its easier in paint.net to just select the alpha in your color dial
don't forget to put the red on the new layer!
in photoshop i'd just feather the eraser tool in brush mode around what i wanted to make less opaque
uh
Okay thanks! I'll do that!
you could do that too in pdn!
well in photoshop i would make a new layer and set the opacity of the new layer to something like 50%, but i have no idea of paint
?
Quick question. How would I make the red transparent?
it's good to do this else things just look real big and out of place!
http://i.imgur.com/n0aXSHc.png items generally leave lots of space around them! ?
i have a mac and so i cant use paint, i use photoshop instead
photoshop takes an ETERNITY to load up
guess it's worth a shot
well
i cant use paint.net
its better IMO for spriting (almost exclusively)
try out paint.net for a bit
i sprite in photoshop
>everyone else
opaque is a poor glow
make the red transparent!
get a better glow
...
The red is my attempt at a glow
ok. I believe I did it
http://www.getpaint.net/index.html
<@175279786833346560> Paint.net like everyone else,
I mean... it works
but it should be fine?
30x26 is a lil big
what do you sprite in by the way <@148680153239781376>
well sprites tend not to use the whole 32x32 space!
oh
oh, not sure, ive already saved it. I assume its about 30x26?
but i meant without the emptiness
<:plum:259939492008296448>
oh yes
pizels
i meant in pixels! ?
put a dark pixel there, and the normal blue inbetween
its 32x32 by the way, winter
that doesn't help...
ah, thanks
small shading fuckup there

about jetpack size
can you tell me how big the jetpack is?
wait...
i know...
its just a screencap, its the correct size
big!
http://i.imgur.com/pwrd4ey.png
i made a jetpack sprite how is it,
lemme fix that
crap
oh, shit
I tried and kinda failed
***shaadiiiiiiing***
shading
nice, uh
ok. New design for the piece. I made it bigger too
Some of the worst item ideas posted here were created to be appended to a preexisting sprite/design
Ideas should come to you, you shouldn't go searching for gameplay ideas based off of a visual theme if you can avoid it
there already are items for shooting a laser and also a portal gun
like a special ability
does somebody have a good idea for a robot character
Lemme just add that when you collect all three pieces they dissapear in place of the satan familiar
Satan Familiar
This is my first proper idea. Feel free to criticise what you want about it
spawns satan
Each contract piece however gives a special perk. Piece one 1: When hit, mass enemy slowdown. Piece 2: When hit, lemon party effect but red creep. Piece 3: spawns satan who has a small chance to inflict fear
oh
When collected from the devil deals it will spawn a satan familiar like meat boy or bandage girl
It's a contract piece. 1 of 3
so maybe you could enlarge and fit more detail
also what size is it? it looks a lot smaller than 32x32 unless I'm drunk
yeah it would be good to know what it is
what is it...?
So I made this. I need some tips on how I could make it better at all
??
ok
*information*
dont know what to call it but ty for telling me anyway
ok, thx for the 'advice'
Antibirth's core team was four people, you don't need a big team to do big things
<@258285593224544256> To give you a serious answer, large community-oriented projects suffer from too many cooks in the kitchen and are often unnecessarily bloated
do nothing but take credit
ill ummmmmm
an ill do musi C x
HOW ABOUT WE GET TJE ZATHERZ TO GET THE CODE
fok i started something
let's found a site called sjwhub just to spite him
BECAUSE GITHUB WENT FULL SJW
get it out of my face!
count me out of this meme!
BUT WE GOTTA PUT IT ON GITLAB
YEAH
DAILY COMUNITY SUGESTIOMS
accepting EVERY COMMIT BECAUSE COMMUNITY KNOWS BEST
LETS MAKE IT OPEN SOIRCE JERRY
sence the comunity knows wjats bets for the game
YEAH
oOOO O ooO but portal obvsly only comunity mods can makes s enese
we should make a mod
hey portal, pm2k, limt
yeah let's not
ok
big community mods are a terrible idea
i am sorry
ok
fuck off
lets make one big mod as a community
Yup
cease spawning is best yeah
Yeah, so how about they just cease spawning
and makes no sense in general
donation part flat out ruins it if your donation machine is like at 999
make it like necrodancer monk where you die instantly if you pick up a coin...
Maybe too unbalanced since unlimited donation
The donation part could work too
Okay, that makes more sense
My suggestion is to change it to "pennies dont spawn as room rewards"
would you die instantly if you pick up a coin?
Or maybe the coins get automatically sent to your donation machine total?
I think not being able to pick a pickup type up would be awkward
the binding of shinto
And my idea for the alchemy one is it gives you +1 bomb or key if you start the floor without one, and +3 pennies if you have no pennies at the start of the floor.
SeemsGoodMan
Poverty, "A Wealth of Life" - you get +0.5 of each kind of heart you pick up, but can't pick up coins.
Oh yeah, how does this item idea sound -
vote for japanese pantheon to be added to isaac for build-a-buddha familiar
Build-A-Satan workshop
I may stick with the contract idea though
I dunno, who needs arms
with mega satan
where's his arms
XD
eh it's fine he's satan
"here have my head it'll come in handy"
But then he'd be giving bits of himself away
That would be pretty cool
OMG YES!
literally build a satan
1. Satan's Torso
2. Satan's Legs
3. Satan's Head
3. Contract Signature
2. Contract Body
1. Contract Header
But the pieces have a cool down time
So when you pick up the pieces they trail you. Then they could act like dry baby or fart baby and have different effects. Like piece 1: Slows enemies in the room for a couple of seconds after being hit. Piece 2: when this one's hit it could be like a lemon party effect but with red creep. Then piece 3 would spawn the satan familiar
Yeah. That'd be cool
So maybe each one could provide a different independent effect, and then when all of them are together you get a transformation that provides its own special benefit?
I mean, it's at least three red heart slots or 9 spirit hearts for this.
i'm picturing a mini-abbadon isaac and i'm chuckling
I know that little haunt gives the fear though
You collect all three and a satan familiar appears. When it attacks enemies it could give them the fear status effect.
What would they do?
You could get them in devil deals
LOL exodia ?
And how would we gather them, mind you
Like you get three contract pieces
What about a version of that with devil contracts
dr fetus familiar inc
You know how theres meat boy and bandage girl?
So I was thinking
like the green in the other versions was a bit too eye-bothering
compared to the 1st and 2nd version
sprite looks marginally better now
Hm... since spirit-heart charm of the vampire is kind of weak, now I have to brainstorm an alchemy effect that's actually kind of fun.
?

if the green would be a tiny bit darker that would be great
But rather found a different kind of wrong.
It feels like I haven't corrected myself.

I'm gonna try and make an item now. I'm feeling inspred
I see. I'll adjust.
the sprite doesnt take up the entire 32x32 grid
hard to make out but like look at this http://i.imgur.com/CQLGwLl.png
and i assume this is a 32x32 pic
yeah
Yes.
It's kinda hard to tell. I think I made it all too thin?
and look at how simple sprites like these are done
open up platgod or extracted isaac files
look i would really suggest you to like
that flavor text sounds more like every red heart you have is turned into spirit hearts.
imo..
kinda weak..
that's...
Is that terribly unbalanced?
For every 13 enemies killed, half a spirit heart is granted.
*Blood becomes spirit.*
**True Alchemy**
Oh. That's cool then. See, the reddit post said that for basement renovator to read them they have to be unpacked
basement renovator just takes the stb file
noo you dont
Which wouldn't work
To use the .stb files though I have to unpack them with ricks unpacker
I'll try it
use basement renovator
But whenever I did it errored
Well on the reddit post for how to use ricks unpacker it said that the .std or stb? files have to be dragged onto the stage converter exe
?????
Yes. The stage converter
did you drag it onto the correct exe
I unpacked the graphics and it worked fine
It said that the exe stopped working
are you sure it errored
Rebirth
which version of isaac
It errored every time
I did
you literally have to drag the .a files onto the exe
The unpacker wouldn't unpack the floor files for me
Yeah, I've been graplling with the unpacker. Should get a hang of it soon.
If you're ever unsure about the dimensions of something, it's best to check the unpacked sprites as a reference
theyre actually IIxII
Okay, thanks!
32x32
Items are 60x60 px, right?
the needle idea is probably better than most other existing ideas though...
gah can we not bully the subreddit without people ***exposing*** us
y tho
kick <@219612927831965697>
someone likes the idea i came up with on a whim in five seconds
¯\_(?)_/¯
http://i.imgur.com/gWwOk0M.png
like just in resource ?
is it normal that the "room" file is in the same directory as packed
feel free
we really have to make one
so, what about the pvz mod for ab+
I'm annoyed that they didn't reply to *anything*
thats also p lame
TBH I'm more angry at the people suggesting gameplay shit in a thread clearly made for communication with modders
why even say that if you're not gonna answer jack shit
Questions are also welcome.
all of it lel
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/4jrult/afterbirth_feature_requests/ I wonder how much of this thread Ty ignored
sad but true
"and we know you're gonna buy it"
hiis description is repeated too
also
yeah i dont get it either
"haha we made our game look shitty on purpose"
ye idk why
that video repeats 4 times
tyboner
here it is
https://youtu.be/mWuX7Lg56tI?t=8m30s
I can understand making simple API examples like monstro pooping, but why the **fuck** would you think this is passable to show to 50k+ people
I really don't get this at all, *this* is the thing that baffles me
STREAMERS
extrahud is the actual worst thing i dont get why anyone would use it
oh yeah that too apparently xDDD
yeah it is that bad
to use it
you have to have extrahud on
its shittier than the one we have so
*DAMAGE: LOTS*
inb4 it's as vague as the pause menu
I mean, it's not *that* bad
they somehow made a shittier missinghud
dunno
what
~~but they did~~
which one do they say tyboner
wait
in the twitch floor stream they basically said that they made missinghud 2
"***low level***"
thanks tyrone
everytime i hear the term "modding tools" i just want to fucking shoot myself
Tyrone talking about the modding tools
"And you'll have acces to really, low level things in terms of being able to do whatever you want"
i cant decide whats worse, the guy fucking SCREAMING at everything or the content
With th exception of adding items
why is it that all the things thev'e said we can do with the modding tools are thinsg we can do already?
holy shit this is worse than i remember
tbh i wouldnt put it past nicalis to actually make the new final floor the twitch backdrop
thats the uploaders fault
my god. The audio sucks
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Found it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWuX7Lg56tI
twitch logos
are those meant to be recesses into the wall?
i cant decide if the buttrock one or this one sucked more
no? ok
he's done like 3 different streams and they ALL sucked ass
did you mean the Afterbirth+ Pax video?
illf ind it one day when im less lazy
look up AB+ gameplay on youtube all of them are equally as shitty really
*no*
go into your history
rip
I already tabbed out
<@70946604139425792> pls
and so I can see it
can you link me so i can relive it
yeah i remember that shit
what
How the fuck did they think this was okay to showcase to the 50k+ people watching
all the rocks are poorly-cropped butts/edmunds, Isaac shoots shitty stars scrawled out with the pencil tool, and the BGM is replaced with Erasure - Always
I forgot how fucking awful these builds where
ugh I was going to watch one of the old AB+ videos to look at one of the items in it
I also added WAY too much wall
and here's the one for the Ruins
So these are the entrances to my new floors, here's the one for the crypt
swift had one too many curries
yeah Idk what happened...
Are u ok swift
v


May Look Like Shit Now
But hopefully I can refine it
So now everyone blast criticism away
WIP
2 many shades for an item sprite
spriting too hard
I like third best but it doesn't fit isaac
or*
i like it better than 1st of 3rd ?
2nd looks horrible, I just kind of scribbled a sort of outline of an ocarina and went "that's good"
3rd Obv the best but theyre pretty good better then my shit Bob
2nd looks best but still looks eeh
such exaggerated differences
I have never seen

I am a man who never arts (because im bad at it) but I was determined so I made 3 consecutive attempts at spriting an ocarina
I made some WIP hands for him in the boss fight

Got them
Nvm
Is it ok if I could get somebody to find the The Mega Satan Hand Sprite? I cant find it...
???
Anybody wanna hear it?
Ive come up with a back story and everything for bob
Now im just gonna make him look more saggy and less like ultra greed
Looks good though
ok...
No idea what that means
wat
Moi bueno
Fixed it up

ah, ok
I know I just did it real quick
keep the eyes, but make them less pixely
meanwhile i'm just patching up the holes in the necropolis walls
Should I keep the eyes?
those sprites are ?
oml

Just a sec
WH
who is?
I mean somebody already is doing ice
fir deps?
sounds good
wen i startd flor art i always recolord everythank
a crypt
for a Depths alt, should I do Ice (hard to draw) or fire (already done) or something like a crypt (hard to draw)
Yeah its ultragreed but it was the closest humonoid figure
yes
good strat
Look at my crappy recolour of the cave
Still Wip but im just not happy with the tears
ultra gred
inst tht jus
it looks good

look at my shitty BOB
your doing better then me mate
not to shaby
I may have just stolen the minecraft leaf texture and copy pasted it to oblivion
heyy it ok yes
Actually
Ehhhh not that bad
This is what happened last time i tried
OH
sort wat
Are you ok?
Are you having a stroke?
een i strugel lol
"Practice"
lots of prcatice
parctis
Til you die
and cry
Just give up
how do I go about drawing walls that actually look like they belong in isaac?
Its coming together

lol k
WIP
So far its a shitty recolour/resprite but in the end hopefully it will be BOB
It's pretty good, especially the template at the end
Oh, yeah, i saw that ages ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/34bhi4/backdrops_explained/
I can get it again
is it pinned?
where?
You might wanna look into that
Did you see that rooms post a while up?
since it's not exactly a caves alt, but rather, a new path
or rather, not the same as the caves
I really want to try my best in making the rooms unique
walls are hard to do
s a start
It'


I know recolours arent the best, but when it comes to floors, it's the best I can do. I try to mix it up though or add *some* new elements, so here's one of my new floors: The Ruins
It's fun to take an existing boss and iterate on their patterns in new ways
no more posthumos shit pls
any good or no?
Idea for posthumous plum

what is it limt?
STOP! STOP!
I'm calling him Mr Meaty and theres nothing anyone can do to stop me

thanks
I'm linking the tutorial because I suck at explaining things myself
this tutorial might help: http://finalbossblues.com/form-and-light/
there's barely any shadow on the blob thing
I think the reason the shading looks weird is because light-wise the shading is quote unquote wrong
probably a good idea
thats what im doing aswell, i have gurdy jr, and most of the gurglings as a shading base thing
just look at the official sprites and stare at them as references all night and day
im thinking the same thing, i can't really get it right
the shading looks really off to me for some reason
i guess
cool
wip ~~i guess?~~
yeah, its kind of like a monstro gurdy hybrid thing
looks cool. will this be a boss ? looks a little to big for an enemy
needs more definition to the globby body bit
off to a good start but the shading and detail is oddly minimalist
it's pretty okay
this is my first isaac sprite in about 2 months, i'd like some opinions if thats not too much trouble
Some sprites for AB+ guise
spider monstro
nightmares²
we got the better deal
XD
It was either this or monstro being a meme
that...thing
It charges and has spiders

It's my take on someone else's concept
nightmares ;-;
WHAT IS THIS
This is what it looks like when put together

I'm prolly gonna have to double the amount of frames in his walk to make it look good
animation is hard

ye
its way better
in antibirth
yea
theres a 'new' one??
??
that old money = power sprite
oh man
not eden OP start/10
fun
whats the point of this
?? wat
watch where you step
https://gyazo.com/171eef591e1ad4a113be51545e9fba63
hEY I MADE SOMETHING
ok
probably
if i want to make an animation in ab+, i need to make a spritesheet for it right?
yeah that's good

Okay, I finished my spritesheet for the bee. Is it decent enough?
now I just need sprite artists, animators, some programmers, a media artist (they'll do promos), web designer, game designer, and producer
alright its official
veggietales fans in da house
you're right its bob the tomato i just looked er up
how do you know more about veggie tales than me
bob the tomato
or are we talkin bobs head bob
Yes.
you know the name of the tomato? its bob?
http://img04.deviantart.net/1ee9/i/2012/091/e/2/veggie_tales_by_papierschnitt-d4unh8w.jpg
someone even started before me already on deviant art who woulda thought
bobstro
http://www.breathecast.com/data/images/full/23775/veggietales.jpg
no please
oh no
the tomato kinda looks like monstro
that's the antibirth killer i can feel it
yes please
I think i'm gonna do a veggie tales floor mod
no fluid animation like street fighter 3 third strike
but other than that
i mean everyone's making reskinned monstro 2 sprites as a joke
not really
I wanna see em all
any good sprites lately
whats good fam
?

what am I doin with my life
I'm right on the cusp of millenial even
only 90's kids remember captain planet
90's kid over here <:isaac_rage:259964923956822018>
because we all know black hearts are the best
I grew up with the captain
i think your idea could work you just need everything to drop more black hearts
because it's dead
o
no
captain planet was a maymay?
captain planet is a dead meme
got you? my oh my whatever do you mean portal-chan-san
yeah ok you got me a bit at first
At least, I hope so
I think "producer" gives it away portal
no way! absolutely not! how dare you
are you being ironic
i need a sprite artist, animator, programmer, and producer. contact me for deets
last boss is dad but its just moms leg recolored with some hair
hey broz I have a great idea for a mod. its called elemental mod theres gonna be fire, ice, wind, earth, heart, and captain planet recolors of all the bosses and they shoot beams of said elements
I'm not creative enough to sprite
Thanks!
Yeah, that's better.

Before I apply this to the whole spritesheet, is this better?
Okay, I'll brighten it up a touch.
Too dark.
The shading's off, I'd say.

Here's the first of a spritesheet (rest in progress)
My brother suggest I post my sprites to this Discord for feedback.
I was thinking that when he gets hit he could trail creep. But that's just an idea. Or he can shoot some tears up into the air if he doesn't get hit and the bowl can fill
why he bowl tho

But idk what
Although I find somethings off about it
I made a sprite. The characters head is a bowl
as long as it's a better sprite than what people are unironically posting on the subreddit
same
It's meh
On second thought
I thought of a cool thing
damn he was hot
it's monstro before he lost his body
Oh my fucking god
this is monstro -1

lol
Waaaaat
this isn't general
wait
666+666+666+(6+6+6) = 2016
le most deadly
newer than ever
why not monstro 2016 xD
upbloat this post and 2017 will be good for you
this is Monstro MMXVII, the new year monstroi
well, not NEW YEAR, but y'know, it's still 2 pm tho
no
greedstro
oh my god

it's already new year here
probably
i hope that i will be able to do my animation stuff in ab+
gotta wait for ab+ and hope it will be possible then
well shit
you just need to unpack the .a files and copy paste them
<@!142309138645516288> no
we won't be laughing for long
like if i wanna change the music for monstro
exept the final ones i mean
is it possible to change the music for only one boss ?

you could at least prove you thought of it early
they're going to do every possible combination of two enemies immediately and they're all going to do them poorly
they're going to do that anyway

rift keeper or whatever it was called lol
but which sprite
i'm going to post a single one of my sprites to the isaac reddit to watch people gush
i invented bloxic shock which is an item that causes the black heart effect whenever you enter a room and also whenever you exit a room and also it gives you a black heart
perfect
*preparing for afterbirth+* starter pack:

* Inconsistent linewidth/dimensions for everything
* Only make one sprite for each enemy because that's the minimum required for reddit karma
* Make the sprites first and beat out the item properties later in your reddit thread

You're a pro at it winter
I'm too disheartened to jollificate this way
http://i.imgur.com/XpEP1Ky.png
And where idiots can mistake it for a good sprite
Like, that special sort of awful where it doesn't look intentionally awful like binning of isek
i could do that easily
can't wait for afterbirth+
oh
does it leave creep
Can we have a friendly competition where we compete to see who can make the worst alt that nicalis could feasibly mistake for good content
that's a bony alt now
I can't wait for Afterbirth+!
yeah something like that
and then everyone calls it more fun than yours because it fills the screen with black hearts
I'm worried that almost every time I have a good idea and I work hard and take time to do it well some stupid shit will release a horrible version of the same thing before me
yeah prob
"LE OP RUNS GUYS LEVITHAN EVERY RUN ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO NOT GET FLIGHT IN  ARUN NOW"
and nicalis will go along with any big meme that takes off
?
yeah, and nicalis goes along with it
you mean ***FUN***
rather than balanced content
hm?
I predict that the sub will be really biased toward OP shit
looks like a gummy bear
the fuck

My bet is that lots of people will copy Little Horn's tear particle effect and recolor it to be red/blue/green/rainbowshit

What is everyone's predictions on what things will become gaudy/overused with AB+ mods
mom's black heart
But it hads a waaay harder womb boss
all black heart champions
to balance it there are more champions
whenever you collect a coin
and
get a devil deals
uuh
also spawns like black hearts whenever you get hit or kill an enemy or umm
omg its so great how you're preparing for ab+ ? modders like you will keep the game alive for a long time ?
effect is "gives you black hearts" because theres black paint
gonna post that on the sub now
done

maybe...
you could do that
less tilted
like a square one
maybe if id make it a different type of brush
like
i didn't mean completley straight
like brushes in general
hmm
yeah im pretty sure itd look weird straight
that's true
and he couldn't fit as much if it weren't tilted
straight lines would look weird there though
you're worried about
if that's what
diagonal lines look thinner than straigher ones in isaac's art style
because
else the lines will always look off
don't do the handle at a 45 degree angle
no matter what i try i cant find a decent way to add lines to the brush part
alright
http://i.imgur.com/j3B8Z6f.png this is the best thing ever
this is what i mean by garbo
try touching the old one up
The colors look a bit out of place, but the shape is ace
in hindsight
i agree on that one
The rounded handle looks nicer
In fact I like this version more
its all over the place
look at it
the shading
so i don't see how it's "complete garbo"
it's better than the afterbirth sprites
please
That's garbo to you??
the old version which was, in fact, complete garbo
i agree in that the brush needs some lines on it
yeah it certainly isn't bad
the old version had a rounder end but the handle was too thick
well, not much i can do about the end due to double outlines
try adding lines to the brush and rounding the end
It's not too bad
I just shared it because I needed it too
the only isaac-styled sprite i made that doesnt look like complete garbo
no problem
i needed it

Im so sorry

it IS anime fanart
I fooled ya
(I mean that in the nicest way possible)
It reminds me of really shitty anime fanart where they draw the mouth on the character's cheek
But his mouth is facing towards the camera
Like, left and right look like side profiles so I assume the middle one is as well
The mouth looks really off in the middle frame
oh god the original
better than the original version by far
Thank you
i love it
it looks so goofy
Any advice for this one?

We can remake literally everything
I can't believe nicalis sourced their AB sprites from emojis
a shit version of ?
?
its
True enough
the sprite's shit
you gotta admit
i am SO not happy about the sprite though
God I loved WOTL samson
fuck you jerry I am SO happy lusty blood was added
thats a fair enough point
because that means another garbage sprite
oh come on do we want another lusty blood
It would be like a reverse proptosis
it would prob break ludo
id like that as an ab+ item tbh
that sounds cool
yeah
probably some shit like damage increase over travel time as oppose to
The tear damage grew over time, instead of by distance from the player
how did it use to work?
I'd almost want it as an item in AB+ but I don't think the difference is significant enough to warrant it
Old lump of coal was cool
yeah
it was   considered bad because of fucking lump of coal gave you a damage down or some shit with shotspeed
knockback i think
i never thought it was necessarily bad in flash either
Why was shot speed considered bad in WOTL again
because it has a useful stat up
oh def
it's pretty good in rebirth though
they really forced the shot speed up meme
ye
cat o nine tails was just a shot speed up in wotl
cat o nine tails
Jesus Juice also wasn't a damage-up
i remember that not working
^
rusted key
like
oh yeah
lol
o
they're so non functional you don't remember them
A couple of trinkets never worked in the entirety of WOTL
lol what did WOTL have
I know WOTL had several
Did AB have any outright non-functional items
yeah sounds like ab+
but *pink creep*!!!!
it's meant to charm enemies but no one had time to implement it so it does nothing
It makes creep trail behind you except it's *pink*
turns the enemies gay
and the sprite turns pink and leaves pink creep
you pick it up
it's an item
uh

the parts outside of the needle might work with double outlines
give it a double outline
eh
idk but the needle is fat
i mean i'll try it but
i'm not too sure about the rope having a double outline
I think the rope could use a bit of double outline though

i just did the sprite sheet for the character so far
Retrofitting design around art results in bad gameplay most of the time
Code, don't make art before gameplay ideas
maybe he cant pickup hearts, but heals when picking up batteries
edgy mask
well my character is a robot/cyborg and i still need an idea
Because my character has a mask and I wanna create some cool stuff for him
fixed it
The,
<@218300326057345025> i dont think so, at least if they didnt go full retard on the ab+ api
so its possible
remix did it sort of
Would a character that starts with a spacebar item that allows him to switch firing modes be too much?
that fills the whole room
what about being able to crash the game
op eden start
a huge fucking sword
what about giving isaac just
what about being able to create and throw rocks
rounworms
something like diglet would also be cool
ok
just, diglet
idk
diglet
?

ok, but something like ditto would also be cool
sucktion
kirby, he kills enemies and then he gets the abilities of whatever he killed
i know it
azazel is just close range
get on it guys so nicalis can make it official!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
az being melee is like saying nuclear bombs are small explosives tbh
Mewtwo in AB+
>:)
Azazel isn't melee
melee character?
Ed considers Azazel to be "melee" but that's hilarious to me honestly
not really
i feel like there already is an item for everything
It's so hard to be original in this day and age
nintendo did it
ok nvm
isaacs awakening
Literally everyone including edmund
its already been done too
yes
btw, has anyone ever thought of making isaac a melee character
^^^^^^
There are more opportunities than "laser" and "portal gun" for a sci-fi themed item
i mean, i wanted to make a robot/cyborg, but there already is an item for shooting with a laser and also something like portal
I know that, but it does a wierd thing where it breaks each wall into many smaller pieces and then puts those pieces together in a random order
You can check dimensions by unpacking Rebirth's sprites and referencing them
too big
Like, how big is each wall segment?
How do floor textures work on a technical level?
memebo
yup
bumbo is shit
<:bumbo:230560518996361217> tbh best ab item you should look at.
still got 3 days to find a concept
ok, i will do that next time
second hand
yeah especially look up the best trinket
Ventricle razor is pretty cool
Since I can only assume you're making a mod for AB+
You should really look up *all* of Afterbirth's items before making an item concept
what
i didnt know that item, but my concept will be a bit different
do you really need to make a portal gun when ventricide razor exists unless you have a completely different concept
well i have an idea for my mod, but my portal gun looks shitty
I'm starting to get ideas. It takes a little while XD
I get that
That sounds a little uninspired
lol
I wanted to make it a soy milk gatling. Not too sure on that idea. I'll have to test it in game
nice
ok
ooo
Which is why I was thinking triple shot
It's a mask
what's up with the eyes
I did a new face. This time I put some more effort into it.  Not too sure about it though
:S
pls
You'd know
xd
look like some alien anal probe
Yeah, it doesn't read well as a portal gun at all
xD
it looked like a dagger when i first saw it lol
can you give me any advice, how i could make my portal gun sprite better?

i dont like the character concepts of "isaac with items"  i feel like every character should have its unique playstyle , its hard to do but ?
ahh
last time we got a character that starts with a weak triple shot we got the keeper
So, I was thinking of a character that could start off with a weak triple shot. Because he has three holes in his mask where he can fire from. The damage would start at 1. I was thinking of a gatling type idea at first so like soy milk. But I decided to go with triple shot. Whaddya think?
but ? idk
it kinda looks too big, youre not supposed to use all  of the 32 pixels or items look too big in game
but do it like you want
imo yes
is this better
http://i.imgur.com/LVgLx3U.png
wait
on the left side in the mid-high
where
look already good but you could remove a few black dots
yeah im not sure about this
uh...
http://i.imgur.com/GLxoiXG.png
ok ty
im pretty sure
all?
32x32
which size in pixels?
how big are the item sprites for the binding of isaac
double outline
shit
good sprite?
http://i.imgur.com/4uGBRR6.png
it is lol
It looks pretty difficult to make a good floor
yes but no one is artistically talented enough to make good original floors except sag

like can't we tottaly change the walls and ground using these ?
why every mod that adds level only recolor stuffs
and actually i have another question
some rooms i mean
some floor would have a giant dick shadow
if i make a giant dick
so basicly
hum i get it
in basement some rooms have shadows of broken floorboards over the room
never seen them before
ho
they are atmospheric shadows on the levels
i don'tg get what it's suppose to represent
i mean if i change em', what is it ?
what are the overlay
Hey guys
dunno
will we ever see a public basement renovator patch for Antibirth?
? i have a beta testors version of basement renovator so idk
how can I make my owm Antibirth rooms?

8 people my bad
4000+ rooms?
but still
oh ok
with like 5 room makers
I ask because making rooms is really tedious, is there an easy way to do it
but
handmade
are all the rooms in Antibirth hand made, or did you get a generator to do it all?
if I weren't so tired I might be able to come up with a few nitpicks but you're not making any huge mistakes or anything
yeah!
yeah not bad
so, I dun good?
?
looks like bottled water to me
appa just loves cum
;-;
It's supposed to be tonic water
cum in a bottle
what
cum
also here's Tonic Water, and its original design
fair?
well think a red candle but it fires 5 times
eh that's a reasonable downside if it's strong enough
(but charging for too long causes you to take damage)
well Flaming Shots is all that but better
now and then, and still it's weird and not fun to use
but you *can* remove the curse with black candle
it was always odd to me that the only item in the game with the mechanic of letting you shoot tears in bursts was the cursed eye, a shitty item which no one likes
sorry, what
YAY! MY ITEMS ARE ADEQUATE!
always thought it was weird the only burst fire item was that piece of shit cursed eye
yeah that's not bad
and fire
so it's like cursed eye but without the curse
Also here's flaming shots

Flaming Shots
"Take it down in one!"
Hold to charge, Isaac shoots 5 shots of fire in a row.
Tonic water doubles fires
it doesn't blow my socks off but there's nothing wrong with just regular decent items now and then
I was expecting "wow, that sucks"
i wasnt expecting that
sounds like a totally reasonable standard item
unlike eves mascara, it's found in the shop though
Tonic Water
"It tastes bitter"
Double tears, Half damage

It's the opposite of Eves Mascara
It's pretty bog standard actually
PICK ME!
OH ME!
who wants to hear a new Item Idea?
I have clorox, and flaming shots in my search history
I just realised
give perma curse of darkness
it's just a black silhouette of black candle and when you pick it up it gives you black candle on every run from then on
I'm going to make an item called very black candle
no problem, I love reminding people
thanks for reminding me, I gotta write these down
I might as well just make a summon/charm-themed item pack
write em all down
i meant an item that keeps showing up the more you use it
God I keep having summon ideas
no, those are different
<:isaac_rage:259964923956822018>
magic skin
you bet
what is it?
is there?
in antibirth
there is an item like that
I want an item like that
of course
You know spice from Enter the Gungeon?
too soon
<:robobaby:248868379287486465>
eh a little now and then doesn't hurt
it's deadly
it's bleach
intense item
for now, It'll be a double damage, slight tear rate increase, HP down (only obe heart), 30 minute time limit.
also, as the timer goes down, your tears increase
But not for here, one sec limt <:isaac_wink:259964931863085057>
but the sprite's already there
Shit, I just got an idea
usually yeah
You design sprites around gameplay ideas, not the other way around
(as far as I know)
well no, because bleach is fine to touch, but not to drink
You know at this point I think we're thinking backwards
what if it spawned a puddle of damaging bleach whenever you entered into a room with another exit at the doorway and the puddle slowly grew over time
That's worse than giving you a health down pill
No, it doesnt feed you a health down pill. It removes the ability to get HP in that space. Like the Broken Hearts you egt from Magic Skin
I want it to either
Kill the player if they're too slow
OR
Remove ~3 heart containers for the rest of teh run
Taking damage every couple of minutes would already be considered overkill, having an item that feeds you a health down pill every few minutes would be soooo shit
Way too much
and that just keeps ticking down
how about we sort of combine ideas. After a few minutes, you perminantly loose an HP container.
well you do have the option to not pick it up though
IE you got the item in Depths II after a really shitty Basement/Caves, and you'll only have enough time to beat Womb, not Cathedral/Chest
I like the ghost/damage ideas because they take the idea of "hurry your ass up" and abstract it into gameplay modifications, but a literal countdown timer could be lame in a lot of cases
so like, "DMG up + imminent doom"
it would be instant feedback which is easy to figure out at least
Not sure about that
still not really into forcing damage though
if you want to do something like that, it could be that every time you take a hit there's a chance the bleach appears and damages you a second time
x2 damage, but you have a timer that you must beat the run in
people would just think its random lol
what if
Have the bleach bottle appear over his head when he gets damaged by the bleach countdown, idk
there could be a visual aid
seriously
look whos talking about "hard to realize" stuff...
I stil think lower HP is a good tradeoff
it might be pretty hard to realize that the item is making you take damage every 2 min
It'll just cause holy mantle to pop
Becasue theyre already dead
Why not the lost
I don't think it should work on the lost, Keeper or ???
though
maybe
What if it makes you take one tick of damage every 2 minutes
I know that someone is definitely not going to like this and that it makes the item bad for some characters but
as in, you can't have 12 hearts, maybe only, 10?
permanent helath down?
A 1.5x damage multiplier is really good and if it's meant to be a risk-reward item the risk should be not-insignificant
what>
go on a vision quest
I still have no idea what I should do for the effects
however with a little bit of effort you can make it look alright
it gets a little crowded, it's impossible to follow the double border rule if you want to have a distinct opening
ah, ok
raising the lower speed to average is fine
for the most part
yeah
So just make it all not solid black?
oh flotilla I thought you meant cap the upper speed
a handle
like
this is what i mean
you're fucked since the moment you pick maggy.
alternately it could be a character gimmick or just a challenge
I make hush on most runs TBH, but that's only because I go to tresure rooms then go straight for the boss
then you're just fucked right from the start
I'd want to cap the speed because what if you're maggy with lard
to have such a downside
if you want bullshit pressure just start every run with damocles
would have to be a really nice cursed item though
don't cap the speed but the ghost speed up could be good
And cap at the player's max speed
I get plenty of good items from the double item rooms anyway
boss rush is boring af
<@145740433165647873> You could always make its speed ramp up the longer you stay on the floor
true
those bosses are all boring
I don't give a shit about boss rush in antibirth
I never felt pressure to make boss rush or hush
luck stat is a bad meme to begin with imo
Going fast in Isaac is boring, there's no tension because how often does boss rush *really* make your run
since it's a slow ghost
I'd make it faster than 5 min though
it could be fun as an item
does anyone else feel like the whole luck stat shit needs more attention to it or something
I wanna feel that pressure
Well it'd be an item you can ignore
i was so ***ENRAGED*** just thinking about the possibilities of that spelunky meme ghost
I'd like to help with ideas but I'm already helping myself and a couple other people with them now and in the near future
bad
Give the player some sort of stat-up, but after 5 minutes on a floor an incorporeal ghost starts to follow you
no
I would actually really like that
You know, this sorta reminded me that way back when Rebirth was about to come out and Ed was joking about having the Spelunky ghost in Rebirth
would you atlest be able to help me with ideas?
maybe do something more interesting than regular stat changes though
yeah that's just a start
You gotta make it great!
No mister, it's *your* item
I'm listening
go on...
they shoot out really quick but they lose inertia fast
what if it made isaac shoot bleach bubbles instead of tears
Even if there aren't any items in Isaac right now that cause you to take double damage, it feels... eh
I feel like the downside is pretty uninspired
I think few people would gladly take double damage in exchange for a lower damage boost than cricket's head or magic mushroom
here i'll show you what i mean
i think the handle should have a transparent portion
but i'm keeping the cosmetic effect
it's a large change considering it doesn't really affect how you play
feel free to suggest how to change it
It looks like bleach, but I'm not sure how I feel about the stats
Does this look like Bleach?

Also, I want your opinion on the effect
You deal 1.5x damage, and do poison, but you also take double damage.
It also turns isaac completely white.
Okay. I shall. Thanks
Make your stuff as good as it can be
Go the extra mile and add them, don't think about it
I am thinking of adding extras
You just changed his skintone with no additional changes
i dunno i dont like any recolors in general
it's just really lazy
Well it's not that it's bad
Damn. Any way I can make it better?
looks bad
How's this for a recolour. Thinking of adding extras
it's not bad
I think I'll leave it as is now
Based off this
burning square ice cream
completely redone

stare at references until the path becomes clear
now what
ok, removed transparency
I meant it's a reason why it should maybe be darker and less saturated
oh
isaac doesn't do that
when I pointed out that it's translucent I didn't mean that it should be partially transparent in the sprite
how do I improve it? or is it as good as as it is?
oh ok
lol
it's a liquid in a shot glass, and theres a purple fire on top
its a shot glass
why is this slightly bullet like tear transparent and the flame isnt
I thought the yellow part was a flaming bullet and the fire was a trail??
I'm confused then
the flame isnt transparent
u could maybe put a bit of glow on the fire
I can't remember ever being able to see through a fire, myself
Flame isn't usually that transparent, is it
cause y not
y
ye
yes
of alcohol?
A flaming shot
i guess this looks fine whatever its supposed to really be
transparent
Hows that look now?
okie doke
well then
ojcaoj a im so happy dw
wrong chat?
????
fuck off i'm crytyping
exceptions
excaptions*
but some thinga like prayer card are exeptions
mostly its like that
it depends really
np
Thank you very much
Alright, goodgood
it's not a hard rule
in some cases it does go over
but if it happens to look better then sometimes you can fill in more
Oh well
yeah I think typically the game goes with what appa just posted
?
so in that case above, alll pixels except the top right will be filled
I normally do my outlines one pixel over the thing i'm outlining
i think
add 1 pixel in between
go over one
The general way I've been doing outlines is to make sure that every pixel face has two pixels on top of it, but what do you do in situations like this where a hard angle creates a space like this
go on?
I have a dumb question about outlines that probably has an obvious answer
so all you could really see was the flame
all the pictures I found were in the dark
I mean you can check google images if you want
a tad more brown and less yellow
less saturation and maybe a little less value
so it wouldn't be so saturated
well it's also transluscent
but, ok, so turn down the saturation?
you said amber
is this gungeon
that's very yellow
Does this look like a Flaming shot?
okay. I'll check around for something to help. I'll hopefully get something
i dont remember
oh
I'm looking for help with afterbirth
antibirth
That's antibirth or afterbirth?
wait
I shall forget it then
if its for ? then forget it
I need some help with ricks unpacker. It's being annoying
I made it in under an hour yet it has more downloads than an ENTIRE COMMUNITY EFFORT
Also WHY ARE PEOPLE STILL DOWNLOADING THAT SHITTY MOD
Situational
?
i mean is it reallly like way better room that'll break my game ,
<@173206704849158144> hey your greed room mod seems nice but is it considered cheating
works too
ok
my plan was to change it so I could use it as an emote lol
And you're planning on doing theme on 32x32 right ?
yep
no, can you believe it?
The texture aint in 32x32 ?
Oh
was a tough reskin, took a few days
I reskinned the trophy to be 32x32
it means you won
<@145740433165647873> thats a good trophy
thank you!
like a chest that changes and stuff

much much better
here's a reskin mod I made
But as rotten fles never look the same you could do some variations
that's amazing
I like the hybrid more
best of both worlds, or unreadable mess?
Tried a sort of hybrid approach

The current iteration looks nicer IMO
?? ??
do it if you really want to tho
??
I'm gonna try adding the bones back in my next take
the bone before looked cool, tbh. But it needed work
much better
not a bad thing imo
that honestly just looks like its from doom
?
better
Tried to make the shading more in line with top right, and desaturated colors
I'm still here
back to the chest (if you're still here), the chest looks too saturated
nice doom sprite <@!146070361929154560>
??
(i just appeared, don't mind me)
yes
like it's everywhere
and add flies roataing around it in game
Yeah the shadow is a bit weird
shading needs work, needs to be paler too
go port antibirth to mac, dumbass
yeah, can delete it now just wanted to make the joke ya know
also no
no
Please don't spam memes in a channel someone is asking for critique in
no
no
no
no
light source top right and bottomleft
additionally i think there's just too many shades in general
I notice that all your 'teeth' that you draw are just white pixels
yeah it's too saturated and there's conflicting shading
do ya think you could trie to make the green a bit more pale so it'll look more like rotten skin ?
the only thing that i really don't like is the shading
make it have flies around it in game
looks cool now
way better
Tried to make it bloodier, toothier, and rustier

use xml animation editing
download isaac character editor
should i do it with lua ?
does anybody have any idea for my animation problem
Have opening the chest give you an STD or something, the world is your oyster
that too
You don't need to have your mod adhere to preexisting concepts like "I need to put X in the chest to get what's inside"
you're sacrificing health for a temporary damage increase
personally i think hearts would work
Think outside the box
There's more than 1 kind of key chest
that doesnt fit with rot chests at all
spirit hearts?
well what is there to spend on chests besides hearts, keys, or bombs
yeah make it be a reskin for spiked chests
It would fit with the rot
Needing hearts?
make it a new mechanic
then don't make it need a key
maybe if the chest had a ribcage inside?
That seems like a good idea, but wouldnt fit with needing a key to open
make the chest half lodged open with bones sticking out the corners from inside
feel free to iterate
It also doesn't have to be bone at all, it can just be more flesh
I suppose, it's not really a problem I can offer a solution to ?
So I should make it more clear the bone is segmented?
Hence limt's christmas comment
So the immediate impression isn't "the white is bone"
There are very few bones in the human body which are flat sheets of white
This is just me, but one issue I have is
yup
Okay, and the white is supposed to be bone then?
rotten chest
Is the green supposed to be flesh?
What's it meant to be
HERES SOME FLIES AND SPIDERS
MERRY CHRISTMAS BOYS AND GIRLS
it's a good christmas chest but isn't it a little late?
People say this isnt the best it can be, but I dont know where to go
Awright, I need help

no sweat dawg!
ah apologies
you'll want to try the <#206619494712475649> channel for that
hello i am new to this channel, but i am trying to download the character editor for binding of isaac rebirth, but i am having some difficulty using your site.
does somebody know how i can animate a part of isaac all the time
also how can i prevent items like torn photo from changing the look of isaac
?
download isaac character editor
ok, does someone know a solution to my animation problem?
wouldnt a run reroll reroll the item
And honestly, saving between runs makes it more intriguing
I guess
Or to get a crap ton of consumables if you want to
Curse of the blind, Dice room run rerolls, and pills
Like, I can see it being useful for basically three major things:
lol
I didn't think about that
Also IDK, captain winter
I can think of ways to make it better but I don't want to help anyone
If your run died, you're likely to keep dying
It takes 6 charges to recharge, so I don't think lives are that big of an issue
does it work between runs??
situational to me
it still just seems
like that would be great with lives
for lives, yeah
sounds like a weird cumbersome glowing hourglass
seems OP
seems situational
hmm
drphobia they call it
Weird item idea: Repository - "Back Up Your Life" - 6 room recharge active item. Visual, green 3.5 inch floppy disk. When used, the Repository stores your current items,  stats, consumables, and trinkets. The icon turns into a red 3.5 inch floppy disk to indicate that it has saved.  When used again, the iten turns green again, and your previous loadout is restored exactly. The item is cleared by restoring.
wong
he must just have a phobia of doctors
right
i KNOW right??
god, the length's he'll go to
i have an appt on the uth
the germany meme is just an excuse to avoid going to a doctor
it's just me, limt
who are you
after pretending to flee to germany
I knew he'd give in eventually
hahah swift's back
it depends if the api is capable of it or not
it probably doesnt have a binding for it anyway
that would be more work than editing the anm2
<@128874748041101312> I hadn't considered that AB+ has an animation editor but yeah, handling the timing/keyframes of animation can be done in script
animate it in lua???
ty for help and advice
ok
Just replacing Torn Photo's animation with yours would be bad because you can't adjust the timing of the animation
ok
To properly implement it without going through an unnecessary amount of effort, yes
To sprite the animation, no
ok, so i have to wait for ab+ ?
i thought that it would work with .anm2 files
ok
And yes that'd be for the best
Or their animation editor, I have no clue what they're doing
so i have to create a spritesheet
ah ok
You sprite the animation *now*, then you animate it in lua when the API comes out
what do i have to do
Nnnno
so would i have to edit torn photo animation
ok i will try it later
Torn Photo is a good example, it gives Isaac a crying animation
Yes, animated character art is supported
Oh, that
the screenshot if above, i want the yellow line to move all the time
Because new items will overwrite it unless you redo the idle animation for every body/head
Probably but you wouldn't want to?
or one that he does all the time
but does somebody know if i can give isaac an idle animation
way too long for a shitpost language like lua
<@162156525337575425> that is pretty good
That lua guide limt posted is perfect tho
all i know about programming is a tiny bit of javascript
all you'll need
skim thru this https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
if you already know programming, dont waste time with meme tutorials
can i give isaac an idle animation
let's hope you're a better coder than you are a googler
google: lua tutorial
?
*thanks, guys*
*i seem to suck at searching*
*well*
https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/
hold on I'll find you one
Scripting is the fun part though
~~probably because i can't find a fuckin' lua tutorial anywhere~~
cool dawg
i like both
fine now
i like spriting
coding, not so much
you should rename yourself CodeSpriter
i first made the sprite since ab+ is not out yet
i like coding and spriting
with a name like codetiger I would have guessed that you only made a sprite because you already had a gameplay design
i will think of something
i havent thought about that yet, but with ab+ i would make him shoot with lasers (i know that there is already an item for that), but the lasers will set enemies on fire after 1 second
what a do
but
what
will
it
d0o
i will add a new animation, and wait for ab+
what WILL it do?
so far i have only changed the design of isaac
what does it do
but
it looks different
what does it do though
First preview
You'll never know until you try
I have an idea for a boss.... don't know if it's retarted or not
LMAO
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/814230024714752000 ED
that looks better
yea
I also scaled it down and added a shine
Better?
do 1 outline, and then outline the outline
solors too saturated, outline should be fixed
hmm
Does that look like an apple, but also looks like it's an Isaac style apple?
I remember Spewer
who remembers spewer
Maybe just the horns, idk...
Tone it down a bit
Maybe make his red a bit less shiny
thoughts?
and maybe he starts with cursed eye, but without the TP
he can have health, but only black hearts
He's much like the lost, but he is probably a bit easier
I like
I didn't want to reveal it, but I mean, I think it looks really cool, so I have to share it, so here's another character of my mod
goodnight
ok goodnight this isnt modding
Just use a backslash
http://i.imgur.com/YSzGdmc.png
ok
ok
ok
use that one
\?
?
also <@!210897422187102208> you know you can copy the actual emote into your name
classic MoI

Thanks!
I like this one!
https://soundcloud.com/hux52/crusade-rebirth
I'm still not the best, though, haha
It's from quite some time ago, experience-wise
I can hear some good ideas in that
Back when I was experiencing with VSTs and MIDI - https://soundcloud.com/hux52/periculum-mix
Yeah haha
Those aren't very melodic songs, that sounds like a pain
Man, good on you
they are *bad* because I did it when I was very inexperienced
But yeh I wrote MIDIs for Diptera and Periculum
Awesome to know that other people notice that kind of stuff, haha
Didn't think anyone else noticed
ye i was about to mention that
YES I heard it there as well
and an old MIDI for Isaac I wrote
I know the operaman better from this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ld25a0LbI
I just used a sampler
hahahah
Yeyeh I looked it up, was interested
Several hundred dollars for a meme opera man, no no
I know the VST Danny used to make the shopkeeper's voice, it's expensive as heck
Mine was made using a few free programs so it's not gonna sound as great whatsoever :(
I mean, the original
It was made with a virtual instrument on a, like, 300 dollar program, haha
Sadly, it was not made with a soundfont
Sadly only rich *real* musicians have the money to afford it <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
I was hoping this would be made with the original soundfont
Was told to post this here- it's the Necrodancer shopkeeper singing two Rebirth guitar solos- not perfect at all but just a fun little thing https://soundcloud.com/hux52/isaac-necro
thanks, discord
they are fixing it lmao
nah discord is fucked
maybe the image's resolution metadata is inaccurate
it does over here
huh
It doesn't on my end
dunno why it stretches out like this when you click the image
mod stuff that im likely not gonna use

did you mean: how to crash the game 101
Charged wide flat white tear laser
when he gets an item
cause i couldn't choose
we should defintly work on compatibility
all our mods are cool
guys
for my robot mod, should tears look like lasers, or should you have that laser item from start
or, a way to make a challenge actually challenging
That'd be an interesting challenge
no way to gain them back
but you only will ever have those 48 hits
You may have 48 hitsd
basically, a cheesy run
i also like the idea because if you have nothing but full stone hearts you basically have 48 hits
It keeps showing up
also, magic skin is like gungeon's spicew
good luck!
good on the lost
though, if you have 11 unusable heart containers...
that sounds kinda hellish but i also like the idea
?
broken hearts
cant get rid of them either
cant fill them
dead space
unusable hearts
with magic skin
yeah
heheho
~~tbh I didnt know it was in antibirth for a while as well~~
I dunno why that was never used before
I like the idea of unusable heart containers a lot
but it's got a few more mechanics to it
oh i had an idea like that
maybe have the unusable heart be able to be filled by another stone heart
an idea for ab+ ?
have 4 hits per heart, but heart is unusable after stone heart is exhausted
replace red heart
Stone hearts:

I like the wierd mouth though
I meant increase the width one upwards
can someone plz agree with me ? ;_,
ok
i think
this one !
choose which one, this or the last one

how dangerous is this roomba?
always be cute
so it's if i kill people with that
well, this thing is supposed to be the player
so it's okay if this thing kill me
but a cute vacuum

looks like a robot vacuum
<@162117085428842496> i thought that too
it looks like hese sticking out his toung

that would help differentiate it from the goggles
Make the hinge 1 tile wider
any suggestions to make it better?
so it is ok like that?
<@!146070361929154560> thank you for giving it back ! ?
i guess
<@162117085428842496> is that what you meant?
***WHAT!!!***
is this what you meant
?

that's gluttony
also here's your vis sprite bacj

<@174193097285173250> thank you!
i just googled it again and i think that i know what you mean now
do you not understand what antialiasing is in pixel art
thanks
that's a rad daft punk sprite tbh
i could scale it and then import the sprite sheet as a high resolution texture into the game
i dont really know how to antialise it, since the resolution of the whole sprite sheet is only 520 x 520 and it is all pixel
<@!146070361929154560> ive seen your post on reddit right now. looks cool ?
a bit
yeah
it looks like a football
yes
helmet
my shameless daft punk refrence in my mod

yes. and animate it
me too
i'm not a proffisional though
and ANIMATE
maybe
so only the waves
ok
so antialiasing it would make them so much better
the waves
^
because it looks a bit bad
so antialias it
i know what antialising is
search antialiasing
no no no
you mean transparent?
i think it would look nice
make the waves a bit blurrier
?
use the power of antialiasing
also
red

.anm2
yes i changed the mouth now
<@143683013597724672> how?
remember that you can animate skin in game
you could go for a more simplistic mouth, tbh
it looks really strange
this?
?
i mean put chads vs screen mouth on isaac
no
and by drew
i drew cankers profile picture
make it look like <@211629803344887808>
constipated face
but pajeet is the only other person who will talk on it reliably and he's in bulgaria or something
gun
i have no idea for the mouth
I've used it several times
you're right there'd be nothing to talk about
oh that totally makes up for it
I doubt that
talk about appa
appa
^
we all have bad voices and what the fuck would we talk about
_ _
the legends of league
the of:
the garry's of mod: 13
the covering of barnabas: infradeath
the binding of thomas: awise
the hoping of jokim: probaked
the delete of system32: afterspeed
the binding of isaac: wrath of the lamb
A boy that got punished by his mother and fell trough a trapdoor
the bloating of hush: breadmund
the sitting of micah: semibaked
the following of gabriel: infrascratched
the bloating of bloat: bloat
the running of peter: superblood
if you need an expansion name you could try great ones like...
so
i actually made an isaac mod name generator as a joke
ab# and ab++
but i know somebody will do them both
ok
ab++
you mean ab#
NO.
you fixed it ?
when ab+ comes out i will add some more functions
since ab+ isnt out yet, it will only change the design of isaac and you will get the laser item as start item
bloat mode
?
so not greed mode
what it will be?
yes i will do that when the mod is finished
but you could always animate it ?
ok
a mod
it is supposed for the sprite sheet
but it's neat
and animate
so i will remove the stroke and think of something better for the mouth
except the mouth, which looks weird
but i like it
and animate
remove
what do you think? should i remove the stroke from the yellow and red line
essentially instead of porting antibirth to afterbirth+'s api, what if you just ported afterbirth+ with antibirth's api
a couple weeks maybe
of course a backport wouldn't take as long
did he let you down
did he give you up
well yeah <@250997734453018624> i was referring to a port to the lua api
553C 0ND5
<@250997734453018624> who hurt you
nonono
we need it
5S3C 0NDS
1S3C 0ND
BASE MENT
lol, nicalis burn
can't wait to push AB+ to it's limits and make a health up item
<:shakashaka:259963719419691009>
wow
but the content modded in will be ace
I personally think the content ADDED by AB+ will be mediocre
lol
but ab ruined the game for me
ab+ is gonna be a huge disapointment and i cant wait to laugh at the nicalis shills
alright

A gun will be modded in 2 weeks tops
ye
its being backported
it would take months to port antibirth
¯\_(?)_/¯
not happening
$6.66 ab price, yeah
ab+ is $9.99
$6.66 if you own ab
i cant wait to donate to antibirth instead
?
oh hah
k
try it right now
yeah you can
then install afterbirth
install antibirth
uninstall afterbirth
yeah
i mistaken it for that item that gives you black hearts
ohhh
explain
also it almost crashed my console
i holded the shot button and the tammy's head could one-shot mega satan
but that combo
yea
tammy's head + chocolate milk + some charge items (don't remember)
i remember i once broke the game on my vita
oh
uh
rubber cement
1000 downloads on Bloat Mode, yay
you can have backpack in normal ab
remember gwaned leaf
shears better
but it deals
2nd good in greed mode
OP in greed mode
this which leaves your head at one place?
didn't played a long time
which one is it?
ikr
cursed eye makes soy milk so strong
it can be good with ipecac
it's good if you are good at dodging
nah
heyy
or coding that
cheat engine
get your head in the game!
it can be done in afterbirth
yeah kilburn already invented the schoolbag
like antibirth?
backpack?
sounds like some total bullshit to me
maybe if you had some kind of backpack system
hmm
not in a million years
nah that could never work
let's find seriously useless item maybe
didn't have to aim
tricky fingers helped me easily win my first Turbo attempt
we need soy milk and thumbs up emotes
like soy milk
that's why it's bad
it only appears when you don't need it
but seriously it's great
but
it's super strong
(active) shitty fingers: reaches into isaac's inventory and removes one of his collectibles
yeah it is
i mean
nah
yeah
op
magic something
midas touch, polyphemus
i thnk that's what it's called
uuh
magic fingers?
it's broken with chocolate milk and polyphemus
useless space bar item: magic fingers
the poop also has a low chance to give you a soul heart
***kamikaze***
<:poo:230363864724799488>
pssssssssssst
distracting enemies
it's at least an averagely useful active
blocking shots and pathing, bridging gaps
sack head
midas touch
poop is op
so it wouldn't be useless
maybe in direction in which we are moving
;p;
their mistake
who cares
what if some idiot misuses any item
Joke's on him
his fault
but not that specifically imo
well something like that could be made interesting probably
lol
Hence why I'm not sure about it!!!!
ohhh it's an unbalanced chocolate milk which you can't charge
If you try to rapidfire chocolate milk, the tears do fuck-all damage
<@70946604139425792>

Because you retain your damage
how is that different from chocolate milk other than that you can't charge it
maggy's milk
Still not sure about this one at all
```* Milk of Magnesia
  "Get tapping!"
  PASSIVE

listening to maus theme off my tv sound system is weird
though if someone did that it would be a tricycle and it would need an artist to make sprites of isaac riding one
don't be absurd
why not mod in a tron cycle
sure go ahead and try to mod that in
"let's possess a fly"
uhh
oh
since you spelled it wrong it's okay
he was greek, right?
i'm gonna call my character herculies
if you try anything I'll sue you
all of it
I got dibs on all the greek myth shit
nightlight is where your body is
http://puu.sh/t4Zni/117d43117d.png
because it's where you're facing
nah
I know slow=/=freeze but still
That sounds like a worse nightlight
no offense
clutches that's a horrible idea and only a total moron would come up with anything like it
im limt
<@145740433165647873>
?
pain
i'll animate this in a bit


hey <@250997734453018624> i decided to work on that BB gun idea of yours
if you pick it up and you're not streaming it opens a webpage of someone else who has the item and is streaming it
<:troll_bomb:230143860813201408>
Or the twitch.tv item could add viwers to your stream
Also it's randomly granted to people so anyone streaming the game may involuntarily have their chat destroyed
biblethump is a tears up
control all the stats
We will delete twitch.tv
let's ruin all twitch streams
perfect
oh
you get more luck with PogChamp spam
The chat is unreadable for hours
PogChamps scale damage up, Kappas scale it down
:0
what if it scales damage *down* with kappa spam
Sounds about as useful as a Tingle Tuner to someone who doesn't stream
u gotta have 1 viewer and it's a damage up
i mean
lua for dummies could be a good book which lets you hack the game
new**
fuck
(;
i've got nre "for dummies" books planned
call him Ultra Tool
nice
lol
and he's guarding the "lua for dummies" book
The library boss is **Tyrony**
i really like the idea of library miniboss
sometimes you have to fight krampus, the fallen, and the fallen in satan's fight in one run
what do ya think ?
<@153966307593814016> i'll actually be pretty happy to help you sprite the librarian and stuff
he's nowhere near interesting enough to excuse making you fight him almost every run
he's BORING
Either with the ability to make new monsters appear or charm monsters as their main source of damage
and he also sucks
ah
krampus is just a boss
I want a summoner character
tho he's more of a boss than miniboss yeah?
BOOM
and if you don't move slowly or shoot
krampus is uninteresting
just waiting till you buy
he would be here like the keeper or satan you know
7 sins suckkkkkkkkkkkkkk
more mini bosses and better mini bosses
so he tells you to shut up
or it could pop chen you use a bomb in the library
more mini-bosses
yes
i did think there should be more mini bosses
like for greed in the shops
doesn't attack you until you make a loud sound
that's a good idea actually
the librarian
that would be really dope
with an individual item
o
yeah that one
the librarian
The gist of it is that once you pick it up, all future floors will have a "backend" accessible with a key, and said backend contains around 8-12 additional rooms, maybe a shop, and maybe a curse room
the diverse server?
that can pops in some time when you enter
you might wanna make a new boss
if you're planning on making things with the library
spill your guts in that one server instead if you want feedback
You know, I got an idea for an item from Mausoleum, but since it involves tampering with level generation I have a feeling it'll be too difficult for me to personally pull off in AB+
ahey winter
no more leaks for now
you're right
shit
the card is a trinket
winter don't give it all away! someone will infringe you!
why not ?
just an item
no
synergy with the card ?
```Cursed Tome
    Visual: A black book glowing purple.

Curses!
good or bad?
Curse of the curse: curses your curse until your curses cannot be cursed anymore
no secrets
no miniboss
no shop, deal, or curse
no special rooms besides the boss and item
lol
oh then yes
Curse of the bland:
you would be once i buff libraries
i usually say no to th library items
and the seven sins
exept for the bible
wow what are you some sort of book hater
winter
not sure about this one winte
Meh
``` - Library Card

did somebody say memes
<@70946604139425792> i'll try
tyroner item
it should also make cancer not appear
>.>
i bet the next one will be a branch that earrapes all enemies.
<@!142309138645516288> Make sure you actually design interesting items instead of trying to retrofit ideas around a meme
every two room
not me
massive slow if you trhow it at him
nico nico niiii
If you take it early on it's going to make shit really tough but you'll get the maximum benefit later on, if you take it late in the run it won't hurt as much but you won't get as much of a benefit by the end
there would be of course the net
OwO whats this item?
About the five items for the number one mod i'm working on

It's a debuff which reverts over time, and becomes a gradually-improving buff after 2+ floors

synergy with my reflection
on a number one mod
that he just found
tears are replaced with a net
i'm curently working
<@!160981982849794048>
isaac has a net
- Net
most of isaac is RNG

- Banana Peel (active, one room charge)

     * Isaac throws a banana peel onto the room.
     * When an enemy steps on it, they slip and are stunned for some time.
     * Isaac can also be stunned if he slips on it.
     ~~* A laugh track plays every time someone slips~~
random crits are fair and balanced

Help me with this one
?
>:(
isaac has fangs
```Metal Shards -
    Visual: A pile of metal shards.
    Flavor: "Critical Strikes!"
    Effect: Isaac has a chance to shoot a metal shard tear, which does increased damage and causes the enemy to bleed, for even more damage.
```
?
already thought of that
glass shard
lol
?
?
Here's my idea.
fuck
```
Glass Eye
-Passive Item
-Some tears are replaced with glass shards that inflict a bleed on enemies
-Multiple glass shards intensify the bleed multiplying damage dealt
-Base damage is 1 + 2 per every floor
-Looks like a cracked glass eye
```
:carror
looking at emotes turn them into items
? japanese goblin mask item , gives isaac a sword if damaged
what if we ACTUALLY made them together
about things we build together
Yeah but here we are discuting
tCotA
mine are already going somewhere
ipecac community mod
Are you implying they won't
like a "modding of isaac community mod"
curry tears!
guys what if all those ideas actually went somewhere
thanks
?? pajeet item
That's a really good idea winter
(:
```  - Poké Card
    Summons a random charmed monster

sireens call - makes isaac kill himself
I wish it were better

? saxophone item kill them with music
i have an idea for a character that can summon friendly bonys along with other things

pins
?
?
made of ice
a whole floor
i want it
? it's just that no one wants it
brownies and dangles creep makes isaac slide so it's possible for sure
That'd be like me saying "maybe u should learn how 2 not suck at afterbirth :)"
Man, come on now
maybe you should learn to not suck at ice levels :^)
whooooooah how wacky I'm slipping and *sliding*
?
?
ur bad
Ice is BAD
who doesn't want an ice floor tbh
? item turns isaac into an anthro deer
bad
across all runs
every time isaac fires a ? tear his tears stat goes up permanently
wew appa
i just want an ice floor
```* Pickled Pal
  "Debuff friend"
  Active (6 room charge)
  * When used, Isaac throws fetus jar in direction he's facing. If jar hits a monster/boss, that enemy will take double damage for the duration of the room.```
ikr
all my ideas are mind butcheringly complicated
Lit
Flavor: " ? ? "
replaces isaac's tears with ? ? ? emojis
All my ideas are pretty simple
better idea:
bad idea
?
no no
????
```Cursed Pin

    Flavor: "Voodoo curse!"
    Effect: Turns a random enemy in the room into a frog. Doesn't work on bosses. Has a chance to turn isaac into a frog for a few seconds. 1 room recharge.```
also my item idea was so unoriginal that it can already be done
That sounds too niche
But you also have to put up with the bigger hitbox size
rotten ball sack - damage up when held (basically trade off for having no space bar item
I like the idea of you just being able to clone yourself, build and all
Man now I seriously want to see if that'll be possible
:^)
gb bug
game crash
then it fucks
idk
it's just a good abel for a room
what if it was a room with a dople/evil twin inside
That sounds pretty OP
``` - Bloody Mirror
    Visual: A bloodied shard of mirror.
    Flavor: "Mirror image!"
Effect: Summons an exact copy of isaac at the opposite side of the room with inverted controls that is immune to damage. 4 room recharge.```
lol
exept this one
tell me it's NOT like jacob/esau <@70946604139425792>
items come fully charged
that
you forget
pepsi man item
It's just another you
It spawns a copy of you. No strings attached
WAIT I GOT IT
that would be a 100 rooms charge item
?
balanced 24 room charge item: wins the game
le holy brimstone  xd
wherever you are
balance 24 room charge item-> take you directly to satan with 3 new rando mobjects
i have an idea for an unbalanced 6 room charge item
bur doable
Let's try and think of a balanced 24-room charge item
it's basically a worse doctor's remote
but not really fun
doable
bah
5 room charge
A superhot item sounds like it'd be a pain in the ass to script so I'm not surprised at all
edgy wing logos
do what you're good at
?
can i just add a saxophone item
idk i'm not good with item ideas
rip
o
appa kilburn already told me that can't work lol
yeah but i can't code so just a concept
that game?
like
superhot?
maybe
i'm adding a super hot item because unoriginal
be back in 20 mins tops
hold up
actually
i would LOVE to see that actually
lmao a gun barrel lodged into his eyesocket
with higher damage but lower fire rate
and he shoots high speed piercing shots
I was thinking for a gun item a barrel would be juammed into isaacs eye
i like taht
yeah
isaac crying into a gun
with a neat little annimation
reload
like range down down down down
and you have to reload
wich grows little and little
exept it's kind of a little laser
èxact same thing
a water gun
how about
BUT
that would break the spirit
at all
i don't think so
like shot 6 tears, reload
that's waaaay better
but ininfite bullets
with a little noise
just better tear with a recharching system
yeah
it's probably not a good idea in general to repalce isaac's tears with something limited
tears
replaces your
idk
since it even
or how about we revamp most of it: make it passive, give isaac a reload system after a few shots, and we're good to go
just make it weaker and then make it charge over time
to wait for your gun to charge
you'll spent most of your time betwen rooms
why
not a good idea either
in general
or just make it recharge over time
would just make me tilt not to find items
and i wouldn't play that
not really isaac spirits either
too much problem
if you have AAA battery when you shoot from max charges you'll go back up to full
doen't look like a good idea
yeah
but you could get stuck in a room
broken with AAA battery
(or you might get locked in a room)
and when it's out you have a verry low range shot that is basicly just you hitting the ennemy
no need to creat carouche
it would have a x3 chance to find a battery
"Cartouche"
and while isaac holds BB Gun a new pickup would be placed in the pool
how about isaac has to reload when the resource bar is empty
yeah bascicly a gun
this needs chiseling
it's a toy gun that fires tiny pellets propelled by carbon dioxide releases
BB gun.
BB ?
so you could put them on fire and stuff
and the second tear get them out
or when you shoo one tear you takes the ennemies onto a hole
with verry low range
yeah
well i want this
lil horn.
that throw holes at you
you know that boss
i want a tear that is basicly the afterbirth boss hole
they take damage from the ball until they die
that gain the same effect
that enemy would be locked into kicking it to other enemies
where isaac would kick a soccer ball into an enemy
basically my idea was an active item
i had an idea like that once
soccer ball tears
it prob will with coding
and douse them in ketchup then punch them away
u could have knockout drops and rotten tomato
i mean
<:isaac_eyebrow:245063314613338113>
i mean you could had a new floor with a new music
you can add things such as conveyor belts or minecart tracks
but not add some
and with those items
yeah you can chnage it
Mod tools can probably add more rock and tile variants
just saying you dont need mod tools for it lol
so what about it ?
yes
you can already change music
but who knows, they might help you do other things
you're right to wonder
>needing mod tools to change music
wich is nice
yeah
and the mod might evengoing to be done trough lua
as lua is really easy af
as AB+ comming modding would become a bit more easy
don't worry
yeah!
nope none exist right now
ohhhh u got me
nah that's just new eden hair
that shit's cray
yeah
are you telling me that edgy hair character doesn't just throw sword tears winter?
can't wait to see your work ingame
like really
Yeah anyway you make great stuff
started talking about it to my brother and he just stopped me cause it looks so cool he don't wanted to get spoiled
like a true melee character
i've got some good plans though
don't get your hopes up
wow someone's already hypped
lol
i'm Hypped for your mod now
Anyway
maybe i will
i freaking love that idea
If you need help just call
thanks ?
wow nice of you to take that request so quickly
the floor will have ice
Please do the floor with ice
maybe we can swap
I need to higher an artist for my mod
hmm well
no pay tho
I accept
oh cool
(;
i'll higher limt (aka melon)
higher
yeah higher a mod maker
or higher someone
<@153966307593814016> make a mod out of all your sprite please
making the entities interact right and stuff is a little trickier but just check the valve developer wiki
look up like 2 tutorials and you can learn it in a day
hammer is super easy to use
true
u hit nails with it
limt teach me how to use hammer
??
that's our appa!
maybe if i learn coding i can make a non edgy mod but meh
rip
its kinda edgy cringe
i dont think my mod will be updated anymore
http://i.imgur.com/Mk93PaL.png
fuck
i don't rly care if i can impliment my stuff i just like making sprites
I can save more complex behaviors for when I start really getting a grasp on what bit of code causes what thing to do what
and most of my enemies are just combining different behaviors together
<@66197463593136128> I've been through a basic Java class
i can move to basementrr
sorry if im spamming
it isn't as easy as hitting "make mod" and bam it's made
art is important, but programming knowledge is just as important
and how much effort would it take to get an antibirth sized mod done for the api?
but how much programming do you know?
like it's cool you're making sprites and all
i don't know, i just have a really bad vibe about ab+

and wooden chests rot anyway
true
Flesh chests arent too out there for isaac
Tbh
wood =/= flesh
why is it fleshy
This one did
chests rot?
spawns friendly flies, spiders, and rarely fly and spider realted items
Rotting chest

if they all change hud then they probably change the same files
that's probably why
and how could they, some are just hud changing mods
need the link to it?
probably because the mods overwrite eachother
Can someone help me
I made a mod pack but it's not showing any mods except the first one I installed.
contrast is fucked
yeah but to they have A NAIL???
i dont like the contrast at all
Its edgy but I still like it
I do quite like that tbh
who's gonna download any of our lousy mods if we have to compete with a title logo like that
fuck dude
edge

lmao
draw edgy wings for it
idk
but a lil bare without them
i think it looks better without them
they look really unfitting imo
tbh i liked it more with drips
good
no more drips
http://i.imgur.com/HPYPxSn.png
purple is a good color
nice
(wip)
we will both have purple titlescreens
but forgot to go through with deleting it
"nah"
i made it purple and was like
i know
u made it purpl,e
forgot to remove them lol
default there
that's just
yeah
??
rest is ok
<@153966307593814016>  remove the drips or whatever on the titlescreen looks awful
<@!142309138645516288> I didn't know you were working with <@175279786833346560> !

http://i.imgur.com/pTK5ijG.png
<@!146070361929154560> you're wrelcome. I really like what you're doing, do you wanna join me and <@175279786833346560> to make a mod with AB+ to add tonns of new ennemies and items ?
yeah totally
Of course but it really shouldn't be a necessity ?
but it would be hard to imagine that they don't at least let you easily spawn items in
with our own tools
yeah I think the community will be able to make up for any ways in which mod testing is lacking
knifek
is done
the deed

If not, you can always modify the starting room
There's most likely a room test mode
Some sort of debug mode where you can spawn in items/monsters
That's surely not something nicals would overlook, right
I wonder how you'll be able to test mods in AB+
I'll make good use of this!
Oh THANK YOU!
here

Corpse
what floor
They have the perfect palette
The ones from antibirth

the ones shooting ipecac shots?
you mean gurgles?
rotting gaper?
with bugs in it
I want to sprite a rotten chest
Just wondering, but does anyone have any rotting gaper sprites, and any sprites with rust on them?
unlocked secret exit
<@!146070361929154560> i won't really sprite much today
<@219284479275958272> <@!142309138645516288> a belated thank you!
ok thanks i'll look at it
in characters\costumes
oh
the costume sprite
change the corrisponding sprite i guess
idk
How do i change the look of isaaac when he gets an item ?
yeah my binding of undertale mod received the seal of aproval
<@!146070361929154560> Awesome sprites, that's beautfull
k bye
DADDY'S PAYING RENT TONIGHT BOYS
ehhhhh
just looked like a ugly unity asset to me
Deleted it cause it is really unsettling
?
I know
ugly
There
not jumpscares
i like games that have a creepy atmosphere and make you feel unsettling
because i dont like being shocked for no reason
Jumpscares
Of
House
Spooky
Ok why?
Damn
jumpscares usually ruin the whole game for me
Just a sec
did they remove boring?
Nah fam a lot has changed
2 boring
but it sucked when I played it
though I heard they added or changed a lot eventually
jumpscares
What sucked?
also it sucked too
Mmmmmmm I have some ideas
that game is 80% dependant on being first person
how could that possibly work
nah though
Spookies house of jumpscares mod
?
put tron in the game
Do you know what would be a cool mod?
<@!146070361929154560> those sprites look pretty ? ? ? ? ?
that's the spirit
Even when thinking small I dont think small
shit looks like you've got a party going on
3 days?
How long have I been at it?

all about baby steps
same with music i started out just with midi remixes of other peoples shit
ok thats how i stared too so its ok
It's just that editing sprites is easy, condusive for beginning programming, and fun

I have a couple items I'm working on
is there gonna be any original sprites in this mod
yes hello It is I a mature upstanding member of society

and a dounpour alt when atibirth comes
a depths alt
I'm planning on making a whole poop FLOOR
Don't show that to Ed, we have enough poop variants already and I guarantee AB+ will have more
that's no good
gross
poop
pee?

The Cafe?
Ooh
maybe a bit yeah
http://i.imgur.com/bOmnqem.png small image but is this yelllow too contrasting to the white
makes sense
<@66197463593136128>
they leaked the algorithm for new afterbirth+ enemies
is this afterbirth alt generator
wow
cutting off the stump it has for a neck
what does decapitated mean for a vis anyway?
I think there's a homing brimstone vis in antibirth
*homing*
homing brimstone
?
>A decapitated vis but it shoots brimstone
CREATIVITY UNLEASHED
erm
"A blue Vis but it shoots Brimstone"

I'm not claiming to be makin new monsters so I can do this
http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=jt2yfDbM
it's a mac issue actually
yeah probably
it came back once for like two hours and fixed itself again
thats definetly a weird bug but i couldnt recreate that. but that will all be fixed in the ab+ version ? for sure
the mac bug that makes the game crash with azazel when the laser ends
for some reason
but somethimes it just comes back
i told you it mysteriously fixed itself with installing new mods
i told you about it on the website
i'm still having the problem tho
thy ?
bringing a huge nope's leg to us
i love you
for that
basically it's a portal
The charging bar
That's it
good tho
why is a spider nest bleeding
<@!142309138645516288>  i made the following (known) mods:
- External item descriptions
- Greed donation maschine farm
- Charge up bars for brimstone & co
- Diceroom descriptions 
- Reflash 
- testing mode
- Item pool editor +  (tool)
hey <@153966307593814016> what do you think of this
the lua modding won't give you that much possibilities but you could had items
yep
3rd january is the release date?
just wait for ab+
Dang it... I had such a good item idea...
<@125999100754788353> yes you can reskin items for now. thats about it. you cant change their behavior
seem like i know your name
then come back together on impact
i get it
if that makes sense
Wofsauge, what mod have you done ?
sorta
Okay, but if i reskin a item and change the settings, will that be possible?
like, have the back end of the top do like 

```
___
\
 )
```
<@125999100754788353> you cant "add" new items to the game right now (without .exe modding). you have to wait till afterbirth+ todo that
since it seems sort of spiderwebby
mmm, I'm not really sure how to describe it? like have the back end of the swing lag behind the front end, then come together for impact at the top?
<@174193097285173250> new item.
<@96016391173332992>
I get the swingback part but what do you mean by stretchiness?
Decent animation, but you should give it more personality IMO, <@175279786833346560> Like a little bit of swingback and maybe some stretchiness in the swing? idk
<@125999100754788353> what do you mean by "your item" is it a reskin or an entirely new one
I didnt know it was just part of gluttony
i wanna know too
<@174193097285173250> thank you!
Guys, if i add my item in "itempool" config, will it be in game?
neato burrito
Neat-o
that's pretty neat
jizzed in my pants
my first animation
awesome

I love that there is a butt and when he opens his chest, the butt randomly dissapears
here is it. but i want it back if you are done ! ? <@!146070361929154560>
How i can change or make a collectiable?
I only have the cage vis
Can anybody lend me the vis sprite sheet?
In my idea, it will be really overpowered and "broken?" item to use but the % of getting it in devil deal is 2%
There isnt an item called "Broken Brimstone" in Antibirth/rebirth/afterbirth?
get that purple freak out of my face
ok
I know that's why i deleted
ya dingus
those are in antibirth :V
that's not allowed here
wait no
yeah
including brims
brimstone?
pretty much all types
ipecac ones or the bullet ones that shoot constanly
that shoot the burbs
the things that are stone faces
no pls
nopls
Grimace...?

isn't that just a walking host but a grimace
indestructible faces
Grimace?
pretty much wall spiders but invincible
a walking grimace is a cool idea
though you have to think about it
lol
oh
it's a grid of 32x32 tiles
As an orientation grid
it sets the mood
i will never know
why do people do the yellow
and the eraser took out the yellow too
because it was on the same layer as the yellow
why's the bathroom covered in white stuff
ya
he just doodled with antialiasing off then came up with some shit
very bad
lmao its just like how toby fox did his concepts
you can work off of it
as long as you know what is what
i make concepts like this

it's a concept
im very bad at making concepts as you can see
lmao volcano floor thing concept.meme
looks pretty hardcore
flaming bony intensifies
Perfection
i uh made this
eh true
borders are like the simplest thing to get right when doing isaac sprites though
just worry about the contents of the image
if you're a starting artist though
yeah lol
and then outline the outline
draw an outline
you just
isaac borders are the easiest shit smh
HAHA
BORDERS ARE HARD TO MAKE MANUALLY
don't worry about borders, use a program called drawstic. borders are hard to make manually and drawstic will auto generate borders of the isaac style
why would it be 24
it's 32x32 you cuck
oh ok
one of them i haven't done modding in a while myself
¯\_(?)_/¯
20x20
24x24
whats the typical size of items
ok fine
you gotta do stuff to get good at stuff
you can't just wait until you're good at something
im gonna wait until im actually good at shit and afterbirth+ is out
well you don't get better without practicing
I plan on making a mod called "TBOI:First Megalomaniac" but im a terrible programmer and a even worse artist

minichibis helped me in the end
lul
i just typed random characters but cool if it actually works lol

hold on lemme tweak it

They'd be annoying af to kill
<@161776977081139200> thank you!
?
http://i.imgur.com/pfoHblr.png
Try it out, you'll go far
Lua isn't difficult to pick up for basic things
Woah those bomb spiders above look cool
that makes a mod for you
no theres actually just a create mod button
Okay.
I'd reccomend modifying existing content to practice
You have to have at least a basic understanding of code to do almost anything I believe
Yes, I guess <@125999100754788353>

If i want to add another character to the game, i have to go full "Code mode"?
also, nice artwork
thank you!
That looks really creepy

I want to kiss it
beautiful

OH YES THANK YOU
<@!146070361929154560> here you are
thanks

<@145740433165647873> hey limt do you happen to have the vomiting trite sprite
once I get that one trite sprite with the mouth I'll make that a thing as well
GOOD IDEA
i thought it released blood tears in an area
It leaves creep
*boi*
that third spider spritesheet
did you think we could forget about spiders?
When I said we needed more flies

*mmmmm*
I wanted to turn the regular skin into a red one
*Clarity*
yup
is this just a reskin of the exploding spider?

with my indian tech support skillz
its actually just a virus so i can hack ur computer
oh my god can this person stop commenting in general
>Not sure why people have problems but my guess is that they have Isaac files in folders with non-ascii characters.
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5kpiwv/is_the_isaac_randomizer_legit/
just post the ahegao to that one subreddit without comment
yea
the filter is terrible and always has been
bit = number of colors in the image
And that's not a "bit" issue
That's due to the nature of the filter.
That's the plan
That should be a item lol
not sure if want
isaac ahegao
shitty ahegao lmao
tfw trying to draw a "having a heat stroke" face but end up with shitty ahegao instead
I have 1920x1080 monitor and when i fullscreen and i have "filter" on, game looks so pixelated, even tho if i dont fullscreen, game looks less pixelated
the textures no either but why would you want to? 32 bit is fine
THIS GUY
Okay, but what about the textures?
meaning there's a hard cap
game's logic is run at 30 fps and interpolated to 60 fps
not possible unfortunately, due to the way the game works
Is it possible to mod rebirth to higher fps or higher textures than 32bit?
don't see much of a difference now
I made those hosts before watching Leather's sprite guide
What a nice person
Leather's guide really is helping me out just a little with these sprites
:S
put a glow effect on it
? winter
not like
in the animation
you could make the fire glow a bit tho
nah
<@153966307593814016>
hey winter aradia ?
does this need any changes
maybe some lines or something
hey winter
yeah but it's a weird thing with a string
but you can't see air so why not have no sprite tbh
probably
it's meant to look like air i think
The first time I saw it, I couldn't see it because it blended in
first time i saw it i tought it was some sort of string-fetus thing
never realize what shape was it supposed to have tbh

yeah
breath of lifes sprite just  looks like scribbles
why does half the sprites in rebirth and afterbirth have no shading
because nicalis is lazy
why does eden have no shading
http://i.imgur.com/hfFekX8.png
?
I can't into sprites
http://prntscr.com/dov6pb
the pins here tho
okie
Don't let me forget
thanks then
sure
Nighty night
but I need to sleep for the time being
I could DM you them later
I have all the sprites
i think they have better things to do instead of giving me sprites
oh
NotYourSaggitarius
relevant emoji Robobaby
who's sag tho
Sag gave me a few boss sprites to Butt-ify
rightmost

limt gave me the revenant sprite as the basis for my revenant host
ask a mod for a sprite you want to edit if this doesn't work
and let it run
it always stops at 80 or 90%
drag any .a file into Gibbed.rebirth.unpack
extract it into a folder
an it never reaches 100%
but i'm too idjit to figure out rick's unpacker
download Ricks Unpacker
i need sprites from the game so i can edit them
***WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW***

they're actually pretty easy once you get used to them
too hard to do
I can't put cracks in my sprites
ERMAGERD GRILLBY
I take your animated flaming boney and raise it with GRILLBY!
idk why i love putting cracks in my sprites

i take your character select art and raise it with an animated flaming bony

thanks
<@!193893570061533184>
they *are* pretty good
I think Castiel is probably the worst one in that picture IMO
is it good?
what are you smoking
i don't really see maggy in the first one at all
how could I improve it?
first one looks like a moody version of maggy but rest look fine
Did some character art for my mod!
butt why tho
Did someone call for Baby Peach?
Thanks again
I fixed it
Wait
Crap
I cant import into piskel
Shit
theres also a version with a butt lolol
Thanks just what I need
yes <:plum:259939492008296448>
anyway here

shieeet my bad
>he
hold on
she actually posted a front view before
<:plum:259939492008296448>
NotYourSagittarius
I'd ping the guy who has them but he might be busy
Can I please have the sprite of Baby Plum?
Annoying af
Slightly moves when hes hit so it can get you
Yeah I did all that but he just catches me off guard sometimes
Just stay slightly lower than it
Half the time its luck
You can actually attack him from the side while he does his brimstone
He has the most bs unavoidable attacks
I hate him when Im playing
I hate him when Im playing as the lost
then the fucking peepers get you anyway
just stay behind him his lasers cant get you there
<:plum:259939492008296448>
remove bloat
unless he is
i thought he was implying its too hard ¯\_(?)_/¯
bad attacks and small hitbox = great challenge
basement renovator
Yeah idk how to remove an entire boss from the game
but uh
Gr8, the more challenge the better
terrible boss fight, has a tiny hit box and annoying attacks
whats wrong with carrion queen
great minds think alike
you sound like every other modder ever
how can I remove the carrion queen from rebirth?
Who here ordered the extra chunky globins?

i wouldnt be surprised

100% somebody is gonna make a mod with exotic butters in it
jesus christ
oh yeah fuck that pitched up voice
wha stop getting water
?
Dumb annoying gimmick
<@!146070361929154560> He needs to stop fucking pitching up his voice
y
heh its fine
It's still a little much, but it doesn't break away control from the player
For instance; when you approach an item the bum is selling, a speech bubble appears above his head with icons of the item(s) of yours he wants
Yeah trade your active or trinket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V5eq4IQ6Go
Like maybe takes the last item you took
also the character in that screenshot for the trading guy looks like an edgy oc
The idea is good but it could probably be handled without a UI somehow
fair enough
This trader breaks that flow, it's out of place
Just look at that one extra credits mtg episode
In Isaac the only things you can ever do are walk around, shoot, use your active item, or use your consumable
true dat
<@!210897422187102208> WAY too swingy
that's what i was trying to say
ye
<@!188945290923868161> Having a trade system with UI kind of goes against the spirit of Isaac
I want an active item that requires no charge but is single use. Only in shop pool, Lottery Ticket, 1/____ chance to automatically win the run
and when melted flies towards you quite fast
it floats like a maw but a bit faster
Mawblin

Super good
helps your chances of getting planetariums
yea i like guppy's eyeball
ehhh guppys eyeball aint bad
trade system
next antibirth update
yeah and the trade system looks really out of place








Here I found a cool concept on the internets
fate's reward and blue candle for d6, trade if interested
d6
item unlocks
what would you trade
We need a mod that adds a trading system in
moi doesn't work on mobile ?
noice
man look at all these sprites that i fixed

we need a pillow shading of isaac mod but it would take so long
comedy gold
hilarious
thankfully i fixed farting baby in my mod among other sprites

<@70946604139425792> fart baby is pillow shaded
ew pillow shading is terrible
don't do what
random question, how would you make Blastocyst actually threatening?
pls no
ew pillow shading
100 coins hype
not me no sireee
i lurve it but it wouldnt fit in isaac unless you reskinned the whole game and who would do that
this style

noooo melon I'm sorry
my uncle died that way
how do you feel about dithering
but I would rest my head on those sweet pillows any day
Im just trollin broz
well nicalis doesnt know how to shade in the first place
It looks awful and not even nicalis does it
are you even a pixel artist
what kind of pixel artist are you
>i love pillow shading
?
I love pillow shading doe
http://orig15.deviantart.net/d196/f/2011/310/e/8/furc_port_tips__pillow_shading_by_nekkers-d4fd1aw.png also don't ever do this shit

this was pretty neat too
i think thats a good tutorial
http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial
does anyone here do sprites/art?
ya dinguses
?
i dont understand pirating a 5 dollar indie game
Plus if I wanted to be a pessimist, all the people coming in here asking for pirate tech support paints a different picture
They've not moved within a margin of 30k, which means less than 30k units have been pushed since Dec. 20

i just might
oh I have

you can pay for anti
yeah
I feel like a chump for paying for after and not anti
I'm sure
lots of rebirth sales
Nicalis already got profit from antibirth tbh
the plight of the proletariat
mhm
is not
making something for free so someone else earns money off of it
making something for free is ok

Or else the port isnt happening lmao
It better mean that

does that mean they get a cut of sales?
so if antibirth becomes official and implemented in normal game

I dont want to have to install a mod to get rid of mods
Not have them forced down my throat
But id like to pick and choose my mods
Its a tradeoff, sure
But to the same extent?
Without hurting the integrity of the game
A feature section would do that
Mainly because it will encourage creation of quality mods
I kinda like it
Which at that point includes the official mods
Yep, and lots of people will want to stay "purists"
Yea, a new player probaly woundn't have dlc for a game that may not like, much less mods
and work their way up when they need new content
In my mind the typical new isaac player should start at rebirth
more than it already is
it would make the game really bloated, unbalanced, and near impossible for a new player to get into
Yeah I dont like it either
yes
Am I gonna need mods to remove mods that aren't actually mods anymore?
a featured mod of the month won't force everyone to play a mod they may or may not like, just being attention to it
Implementing mods pernamently sounds like an awful idea actually
amazing meme
edmund in charge of game balance
the ones that look cool by far
Or will he just pick the ones he thinks are cool?
will he try to make it easier or harder? Will he try to balance it out?
to implement into the game proper
I wonder which mods edmund will choose
first mod i will make
when you have 3 cat items you shoot become cat and shoot flies how come when you get 3 fly items and become a fly you dont shoot cats
sick
I had a Pentium 4 at the time ?
i did not even have that great hardware is what i said
yes
Flash itself is the limitation, throwing better hardware at it doesn't help at all
well i dunno
I had an overclocked i7 2600k which was top of the line for its time and I reliably experienced slowdown when more than 5 explosions happened at once
it was high tier 2011 stuff
not even that good dude
I call BS
specs?
damn
many on others, tho
i never had a single slowdown on flash boi on this computer
people keep saying this yet it never happened to me
that's just flash
BoI was easy because it would slow to 5 FPS whenever more than 10 bullets were on the screen
rebirth was much easier in a variety of ways
that's part of why it was easier
I am willing to bet the clothes on my back that the very least, that'll be possible
rebirth added too many damage ups i think
<@66197463593136128> It would be a complete failure on the part of Nicalis if something as rudimentary as item synergies were impossible to implement in AB+'s API
I don't remember WotL that well, it was a while ago. flash BoI was a simpler time
wotl was some of the most fun i had playing isaac
i agree
for me, anyways
WotL had perfect balance
it all depends on the player
for me the ideal balance would be geared towards WotL
if you want to make it harder, go ahead too
if you want the game to be easy, go ahead
"removed carrion queen and mask of infamy and the bloat and walking hosts and will you look at that, no more game left"
you make your own balance
even tho we have communities and speedrun scenes and shit, isaac always was a solo experience and will even more be once ab+ is out
as long as the more polished mods play nice together i can probably deal with making balance changes
it's a guarantee that the first mods are ***OP START*** or ***HARDER ENEMIES!!!!!!!! THEY EXPLODE IPECAC BRIMSTONE TEARS***
you make your own balance
but as i said you don't have to use it
At least we have poop Monstro <:poo:230363864724799488>
im betting one of the most popular mods at release will be some dumb shit like "keeper starts with godhead"
of course mods will destroy balance, this is what mods do
it's scary
we don't know something so basic a week from launch
i don't even know if ab+ allows for synergies
anyway
¯\_(?)_/¯
I imagine the'll be a LOT of compatabllity patches between big mods, for synergies and getting rid or overlap
it's funny
to people that didnt see the start of our discussion it looks like youre talking to yourself
and i do suppose that if someone wanted to they could make a game balancing library
i mean yeah you have a point about the mods
so anyways
it looks like a hive to me
I like the ghost looking one
FLIES
LV2
ENOUGH
NEVER

I have no idea, thats why im making you guys do it for me
how could I choose!
or shit vis?
lvl 2 spider variants
fatty that barfs out red poop leaving ipecac
Awright, what should my spriting priority be tomorrow:
youre dead
gunpowder
If you push the button it reveals the prize inside
or spins
it just plays music
but instead
looks like one of those things that you push down and it could activate about a million things
<:plum:259939492008296448>
mega fly
can they get new names
the names for those flies suck
finally someone gets it
We really need more lv 2 fly variations

something like that could be fun
Imma post my idea here. So  enemy. Its called "Weeper" and its basically stone enemy (looks like Gaper) and  you have to shoot tear/look towards it in order it not to attack you, if you turn your head off of it then it will "run" closer to you and start shooting bloody tears.  You can only kill it with bombs and if it spawns alone or with other monsters (if you kill all the other monster) the room doors will open and you can kill it or not (he will despawn when you walk out of the room and back) Im not a great modder so, if anyone wants to use my idea, go ahead.
?
made blood a bit less erratic and added stitches to mouth, along with outline

better than eating a raw isaac thats for sure
reheated isaac
sounds tasty
eh
reheated?
decided the name for my mod
thank you!
I suck at spriting so I can only offer my two cents that it looks pretty nice
What else would you guys reccomend?
yeah that's certainly an improvement
Does this work any better?

but it you can manage that it might be pretty cool
and it generally, especially the black parts, could use some antialiasing touches
the blood looks sort of oversaturated and the shading is erratic on it
alright
I'll try that
try to see if you can get it to "blend"
the gash is okay but i wouldn't necessarily use a black outline for it
the face just needs more detail in general
add another shade?
How would I fix it?
especially the face
it looks unfinished
i'm not a big fan of the sprite... in general
any thoughts?
Just finished the creep charger

thank you
coo'
but I really want to add an alt to the depths with conveyor belts and mace balls
It's just gonna be some enemy variats at first
I'm gonna start working on my code once AB+ comes out
ye
jerry is a tool
I'll kick u for kicking
it means
?
tool
?
i'll kick u
uh
wrench?
o
oh ok
no dont ban them ?
?
i'll ban u
flotilla pls
no please
This is basically cyberbullying I'm calling the cops
a boy ? who achives godmode
its quite good
very unique
its no antibirth but
it has a unique take on isaacs story
godmode's pretty good yeah
ok
look up godmode
kinda underrated but
do tell
there is one rather good mod
its fucking trash
it's *terrible*
you know actually
who woulda thought
that one's NOT GOOD?
wait so you're telling me..
we do not speak of nuclear apocalypse
nuclear apocalypse
winter and I are beginning work on our respective mods
The Binding of Isaac equivalent to putting your super OP guns in Doc Mitchell's house
no
n
nononoonononononono
horrible fucking mod
*internally reees at Flotilla*
no
oh
yeah lol
oh god no
lol
and white pixel artifacts
oh god
i saw one that had some sprites that looked like they came from maplestory
interesting OP START mods yeah
When AB+ comes out expect a few interesting things then
I can think of a couple
ok then
aqapack xd
nope
no
besides antibirth
^
antibirth
antibirth
antibirth
are there any interesting mods in development currently
hah gotcha
no thank you
and I'm like great job I got hurt
kekko
then one of the twins gets stuck
fug you
There's a leech in my boot
there's a worm in my boot
he'll poke a hole thru the floor
woodyworm
yea the twins can be a handful sometimes
that water worm boss
limt dont you pull a winter on me
yea bud
unwieldy?
red jacob
esua
i unlocked the twins but they're unwieldy
yes
Isn't Edith the Antibirth character that isn't finished?
it's true, you've changed my mind
eden is usually slightly better than default on average
are you confusing eden and edith together
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
18 quintillion procedurally generated edens
eden is a whole new character every time
hoo boy we're entering some sensitive territory
Eden is like one of the best characters what
also since when does eden suck
The whole point of Eden is they advocate for the trans community
they.
i thought the whole point of eden was she/he sucked
make a OP EDEN mod
rip
I'm sorry I can't make a mod
pump

<:whipper:259939519061688320>
FUcking hell
gay?
looks like you got fucked this time too
Wow robo I thought we were friends
In truth, it's actually portal who is the big fat meanie butt
Let's make a mod where you fight Robo-Baby 2.0 as the final boss
DAD IS GOD
Robo-Baby's lack of acknowledgement tells me that your statement is FALSE
How about... get this...
Let
oh fuck me
lets make a mod where you fight god and dad as final bosses
flotilla is a big fat meanie butt!!!!!!!!
I GOT THIS
ACKNOWLEDGE ME ROBO-BABY
I got the butt and portal didn't ?
a mutated pat robertson with a veggie tales army
gay tbh
Why isn't he responding to gay
and pat robertson
you're just not gay enough for him
Is gay not the trigger word for the rainbow flag?
Okay so if I want robo baby to react to my stuff I need to type out longer phrases and then butt
Ok now I'm confused
butt face
gay?
lol
idk but robo baby is kinda gay
random
What causes it to react?
What is robo-baby 2.0 doing?
veggie tales and peter popper
yeah
yea man
Veggie Tales is Christian broadcasting?
so maybe veggie tales
only christian broadcasting
?
Isaac played with his toys
yes
Did you watch the intro
No
do you think isaac was allowed to watch tv?
?
blown off
no socks
?
aw no sock emote
That's the spirit
? when the lucc is good
and when I come back, I'm gonna have a fantastic mod idea that's gonna blow your socks off
lucc
Add drawing board as an active item
good luc
good luck!
ok, listen, I'm going back to the drawing board
hah!
hahah!
heyoooo
bepis
saying heyoooo makes any joke funny
?
not funny
I get enough of it at home
dad's son
no
That's not an item I want
heyoooo
dad's penis
Dad's Lipstick ?
dad's 9mm submachine gun
whats next, a god final boss?
dont do the thing people had bad ideas about ever since flash
but I'm not creative
Remember when people thought triachnid was Isaac's dad because he was the final boss of WOTL in v.1.0 because Florian fucked up
dad's basking shark
be creative
if you want to be taken seriously, dont add fucking DAD
dad's big foam #1 hand
oh im just giving friendly advice over here
no the peer pressure is too much
dads lore is a meme thats meant to be forgotten
I think if they want to add Dad stuff, go ahead
dad's mime costume
i sorta agree
yeah its a meme alright
*Dad Ski*
dad is the most uncreative things you could possibly add
it is
A MEME?
That's literally just the game
That's not a meme lol
thats the meme
dad is supposed to be absent
teach me more about your meditations on isaac's dad
*Dad's Bottle of Pills*
ok
*Dad's Knife*
drop your idea now
no
I thought about making a mod expanding on dad's lore
Sorry, I'm a bit late to that conversation
I think the health scaling is stupid
sry friend
lol
oh yea
limt said flotilla
you're high enough to think I was addressing you
I aint high bud
WRONGGG
yall high as fuck flotilla
yes but i think its because the witness, the stage is zoomed out
Other than the HP scaling I think Hush was a very nice bossfight
hush sorta is bullet hell but  it takes no skill to dodge the bullets
Whaaaat
and hush was a horrible example of it
mean
I think the witness and scourge do it very well for instance
your character is too big
sometimes lots of bullets work and sometimes not
dont know how to explain it
isaac has never at any point got close to real bullet hell
Too slow?
are people pro/anti bullet hell for boi? the game seems too slow for it
my idea is to make the game a lot better
<@145740433165647873> whats your mod idea brev
I have a small list of items I plan on making but nothing super ambitious
this is limt you're talking to
yeah of course I do
anyone here got a fantastic mod idea
he won't throw in a peach for just any butt's buttposting
fuck you robo
nice try
butt.
Watch *this*
now it doesnt do it
?
beautiful peaches, peaches for me
DENIED
butt
holy shit robo calm down with the peaches
I use SciTe
probably a few community tools will be made to make things easier at least
i use visual code studio cause im l337
no guess what, making mods isnt as simple as clicking a single button
I wish there was a make mod button
besides gimp of course
theres no make mod button?
yeah you cant just click "make mod" in a fancy ui
notepad++, arguably the best coding tool
onoes
You just do the code and put it in a text file in the right folder
Yeah, the UI is Notepad++ my dude
and yeah the important part is lua coding
o, ok
oic
<@257671069484318731> There is no ui, it's all Lua coding
we've seen pretty much all the tools
ui?
Hoping they take community requests for a couple of things
has there been any released footage of the ui at all?
I expect bugs with the mod tools that will need to be fixed
they'll probs update some shit
I imagine they'll add new features to it based on the community's feedback
anyone know if modtools is just going to be one release or is nicalis updating it consistently?
nerds
sweet
<@!193893570061533184> Rick himself has said that he's working on it and he has unpacking working. He just needs to figure out the name hashing. So we can probably expect Rick's Unpacker to get an Antibirth update soon
Using Rick's?
Failed
I've tried unpacking Antibirth too
<@!193893570061533184> I've tried unpacking Antibirth myself using Rick's Unpacker, but unless you can get a list of all the items in it (which is possible but I haven't done it successfully because it was annoying), then it won't work.
check <#260932688209379338> <@!193893570061533184>
how do I unpack antibirth
Okay, thanks guys!
Yes
the original texture are already 32?
Save it as 32 otherwise it wont work
32
16?
8?
Okay, whats the max bit i can do?
Create the folders if necessary
Then put it in resources/gfx/backdrops
Im doing it for rebirth
Do you have afterbirth or not?
No need to pack
And if i finish it, i do it back to .a and put it to rebirth folder and that will work?
yea
All i need to change the texture is making this different? http://prntscr.com/doofpc
I'm having a slight issue with getting a sound mod for Rebirth. I'm putting the mod in the resources folder and it doesn't seem to be working. I'm guessing I'm making a very simple newbie mistake as I am just getting into modding. (link to mod: https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2608/loadsamoney-coin-sounds )
we don't know
¯\_(?)_/¯
How about unlocks? like completion marks?
oh good, pm
They confirmed that adding characters is possible like very early in one of the first tweets  @Tinsin#9085
yeah
to the application?
or is that a different unpacker...
drag and drop the .a
oh yeah that
don't you drag and drop the a file?
do you have .NET
So, i downloaded the ricks "unpacker for rebirth" but non of the applications run
Characters, unlocks, and beyond are probably off the table.
I figured
:c
doubtful
Though I hope for more
I'm thinking it'll be items and enemies only.
So how little do you think they'll allow the api to touch?
lol
i guess but i open all of them just in case i want to mod other shit later
i suppose so
So, all i need to "open" is graphics?
sound effects?
sound effects
sfx
Whats under "sfx" folder?
I know :c
for now
doesn't work on antibirth though
look up ricks unpacker for rebirth
If you've ever used a zip unpacker, it's just that
You're just unpacking and repacking .a files
yeah
You don't need to have any scripting knowledge whatsoever to make texture mods
I still have to "open" .a file(s)?
its pretty damn easy to make a texture and music mod n stff
I would actually love to make a texture mod. But i havent done any coding in my life, so...
If you want to do something like Antibirth? Yes, absolutely
If you want to do something like a texture mod? Not really
Is it really hard to mod BoI:Rebirth?
true
I mostly don't want that, for fear of branching
"*here's my bad code, criticize it~*"
in my wet dreams kil gives us beta testers full antibirth sources access
if only
*"fix our game, kil-kun~"*
In my wet dreams Nicalis hires Kil and gives him full source access
first thing i'd do is give flooded caves the downpour shader
potentially
assuming it becomes part of AB+ after several devil deals with nicalis, i wonder if they'd let kil fix it like that
Lock the alt floors behind unlock conditions like Cellar/Catacombs etc, retain the sort of enemy diversity that you saw in WOTL Cellar (and see in Antibirth's alt floors everywhere), fix Hush/UG's damage scaling, add tons of new waves for Greed Mode, seal a blood contract with beelzebub to make Keeper fun somehow
since flooded caves could clash with downpour
though im curious on how they'll fix the alt floors
^
dont worry, when antibirth gets ported to afterbirth they're gonna fix everything in it
for a mod to just fix afterbirth
You know what I want more than anything else
it was just a test
ye
so quiet lol
no thanks
i also did that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhGq0mjjKtM
WOTL... that's a name i haven't heard in a long time...
Afterbirth+ & Knuckles
I didn't want the D6 nerf you FUCK
I hate eternal edition for stealing away 1.48 from me
afterbirth+ eternal edition
No patches, no DLC, etc.
Where people just have years to get accustomed to the game how it is
with like "hum... this is like afterbirth, but it's a bit better, but this again"
I wonder if Afterbirth+ will ever have that years-long grace period of no patches like WOTL had from 2012-2015
afterbirth +
well the communication is bad too
wii u
how am i supposed to get hipped
new 3ds
goddamit
i mean the name
Also the communication is shit
Right
ab+ is the end of the line
there wont be any more dlc anyways after ab+
hi everyone its been a long time
quality over quantity
They've said as much
There won't be anyways this is the last one lol
no dlc > shitty half assed dlc
if you don't support them, the'll be no future
Like there would be any new dlc if no one buys this one
people like you are the reason isaac is how it is today
i just wanna keep the surpise to be like "holly shit new item! what's the effect ?! dams in don't understand !"
^^^
Because it encourages them to do the same thing in the future
Defending Nicalis' laziness because 'you're having fun' is a shitty thing to do, IMO
weirdo
The issue for many people isn't that AB is shit (although some people do indeed hate AB), but that it's halfassed in so many ways
it having fun eating this plate of shit so let me eat more
i know i know
so what is ten bick for a bit more fun
But you could be having more fun if they bothered to try
and i'm going ot have more fun with ab+
i'm having fun
But meh
It's a good reason
Yeah...
i also uninstalled afterbirth before antibirth
Imagine if the alt floors were actually good
Imagine if Blue Womb was an actual floor
i doubt i can actually be dissapointed
Being disappointed because they could've done better is a valid reason TO be disappointed though
some of us here are disapointed with afterbirth, we're gonna be disapointed with ab+
most of you are just disapointed
regardless of the "they could have done so much better" stuffs
what i wan't is just having fun
i would prefer antibirth tho
playing it
but i'm having fun right now
Yeah
"Kinda fun" isn't the standard you should hold yourself to when you know that they can do better
no, not that good but kinda fun
cause it only adds fun stuff
Because in many ways it just wasn't that good
but again if it where free, i would play it
No, they're critiquing it just the right amount
sure not worth the money
What i mean is that, you are just overcriticizing afterbirth but it's still some... pretty good content, i guess
Played so much more of the broken 3ds rebirth port than of afterbirth and still had more fun
that's whats so great about it too
By that metric most of the community has uninstalled Afterbirth even, haha
Yes i did before antibirth :)
Also most people here have uninstalled Afterbirth because of Antibirth so your point is moot :p
yeah before antibirth i mean
Afterbirth ruined the game for me a while after it came out
so i can play antibirth
The alt floors are halfassed and have always been my biggest gripe with Afterbirth
i actually have uninstalled afterbirth
Uninstalled it and had fun with isaac again
yeah
Quality =/ quantity
I actually have
cause it's shit but it adds a bit
no
befort antibirth i mean
to play normal rebirth
Which uniformly lowered the quality of Afterbirth as a whole
but have you actually unistalled it ?
<@!142309138645516288> tell that to burning basement/flooded caves/dank depths/scarred womb
all you guys are saying afterbirth is shit
maybe not much but add a bit
jsut add to it
and i higly doubt new stuff can ruin the game
Anyway i'll blindly by it cause i love surprises
but it's not out yet
Yeah the definitly think it won't be
It's not even about that, I think; a lot of people here just think it won't be good?
if it was a free update for afterbirth and not a goddamn 10$ dlc for a dlc then we'd all be happy
i agree the money might go to shitty people
if it where free, you'll probably try it
but it definitly is
you said it's not about the mony
if it's to try out some new stuff for TBOI
i don't really care about wasting money
my money only goes in games or so
no need to pay axes or stuff
considering the fact that i'm still living to my parent's house
True
that too
A $100 waste of money and a $10 waste of money are both wastes of money
the issue is where the money goes
me
who care about ten dollars
money isn't the issue
you're talking about it like it's freacking expensive
i don't care i'll jsut try it
It might even be really bad as you say
i mean, yeah might not be good
i know what it's based on
I'll pay for something from isaac
a lot of us here just aren't buying it at all
see, flotilla is optimistic and still being defensive about it
I'm buying AB+ under the pretense of it being good and its modding support eventually making it worthwhile otherwise, but saying you'll literally pay for shit is no good
fun?
going in a gamble?
you have high hopes for it and you dont even know what the fuck you're buying
potentially wasting your money is fun?
i'll jus try it out
that's what's fun about it
If you say you're literally willing to pay for mediocrity then not even I can support that
yea but your going in blind
wha
i love the gameplay
because i love this game
and 'ill honestly pay 10 bucks for some shitty disigns, a new floor and new items
but it adds a bit to the game
because it might not be that much of a new thing
that's why i love agony so much
most of the mods just replace stuffs
i mean exept for antibirth
not much mod really adds some new things
but it's still going to be fun
i might not love
with noew things
cause i just wanna have fun on the binding of isaac
*Effects: Rechargable item. Spawns a fly turret (selects an enemy in radius and shoots at it once per ** frames (* secs) with a tear of collision damage *.0f (Isaac base damage *.*)*
They did
i'll buy it just because ther's isaac's name on it
did they say that?
<@!175392549035442177> Brown Nugget's damage scales with Isaac's
papa fly doesnt even do much to begin with
It requires looking past the shitty reused art of course, but gameplay-wise I really like it
Honestly Brown Nugget looks good to me; it has a fast timed recharge so you can drop multiple in the same room, so I can already see myself fucking up tanky bosses/boss rush with it
no
were they better named ?
just look at the original items
it's an example mod they showed
but
That sound kinda silly
XD
XD
pooping monstro
what about
silver crown
or
oh so you wouldn't wanna have "brown nugget" spoiled for you
<@!175392549035442177> I say this as someone who tries their hardest not to be a nicalis shill, but ~~I actually like a lot of the new AB+ items shown so far~~
you're nicalis's target customer
yep
because it has "isaac" in the name
yep
you're blindly buying it
see that's the problem
ain't looking at it
same goes for antibirth
don't wanna spoil anything
nah
have you *seen* the items they're doing
I'LL STILL BUY SHIT IF THERE IS ISAAC ON IT
so
theres far more evidence leading up to it being shit than not
i mean
***drug dealer, best in crack(s)***
lol
i actually bought the game twice
ho.. you
<:plum:259939492008296448>
i never gave nicalis a single penny even
It's that no one knows how it'll be ATM, even if you can make inferences
the price is irrelevant
whoever is behind
I mean it's not even that it's cheap
i 'll just forge my own opinion
ten bucks isn't that much
<@70946604139425792> exactly
How can your convictions be so strong despite it not being out yet??
Man, see to me *this* is incredible
well i'll buy it
same
i refuse to give nicalis another penny tbh
who knows, maybe kilburn will just be like "k source code" one day or something
regardless i'll just stick to antibirth
i'm not buying it because i don't want to give money to tyrone
i hope it would be good then
taht's a pretty good thing
i'm not gonna not buy it because it's good or bad
not happening
egg on thier dicks ?
true
At the end of the day if it ends up being good (I know), a lot of people here will have egg on their face
<@175279786833346560> good one
its kinda incredible
you're fully aware of how shit nicalis is and yet you still somehow remain optimistic
but if it's bad it's what i expected
I can't let the negativity eat me up, man
then if it's good i'm not being disappointed
i'm fully prepared for it to be another afterbirth by not beinge optimistic
taht's kinda what i feel too
Regrets of Isaac: Afterbuy
your optimism amazes me tbh
I'm staying cautiously optimistic but am fully prepared for it to be another Afterbirth <:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
ok?
cause i got the money and i still wan't MORE stuffs and ingame mod support
what does that have to do with having trust
i'll still buy it day one tho
i just don't care
<@162156525337575425> you're right
No one had any reason to doubt that Afterbirth would be good, did they? After all, our only frame of reference was Rebirth
man remember when afterbirth added a new chapter
why have trust and lead yourself up for a second disappointment
To be fair everyone did Appa
this time
they could actually do somthing
i had trust for afterbirth and
maybe !
maybe ?
have some trust
2016* oops
i sorta doubt that lol
~~I really hope the extra 7 months allowed them to make it decent~~
Remember when it was due out in summer 2016?
The first Afterbirth+ update was a year and half a month ago
God damn
i donated 25 dollars to pajeet because it was that cool
well it looks cool
pajeet made it
but still seems like a lot of fun
i heard it was
no
especially for the grahics
aren't we all
it's broken
the isaac randomizer seems like a lot of fun
lmao
Don't think they can do that at all
Doesn't he still retain full rights and creative control over TBOI and Rebirth
*everything*
funny how it was originally ed's idea
basically
tyrone: ed we're kicking you out of the isaac team but we still need you in PR
I don't know a thing about that ?
no new developments between kil and ed
i mean it as in
Context is important jerbear
yeah
he said it like an hour after the trailer came out
Whereas when he last said it, everyone only thought it was some dinky item mod
Because he's saying that knowing exactly how ambitious it is, how much shit it adds, etc.
that's not news
of course he wants to bring antibirth to ab+
yep (to portal)
Him saying that he wants to bring Antibirth to AB+ after its release is a development IMO
all you need to know
tl;dr theres been no new developments and ed is just shitposting
communication fixes everything
lack of communication
"from what i hear"
he's taking tyrone's word for it
see, edmund doesn't actually know what's possible
yeah yeah yeah this is ed being ed
yep there's the problem
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/813860509606809600 Ed...
easy to imagine
oh
it's just a giant nerve tendril that does nothing
hard to imagine
wow
cool idea: a nerve tendril boss

i approve
in weird situations
yeah, rebirth isnt very asynchronous :/
the game don't crash
jsut saying sometimes
don't know about that
there's a difference between not finding a sprite and the inability to use a non blocking I/O module
that's good
the game don't care if sprites are missing
and it's fine
so i just fight invisible ennemies
and i'm to lazy to remove the shitty files
but the ennemies still there
so the sprites are missing
over some Agony files
and i missinstalled binding of udertale
i'm lasy has fuck
for instance
(not talking about the spider mod)
i mean if somthing went wrong
well sometimes the game don't crash
for now, i dont think nicalis can do much to fix their mess
since that runs on top of node.js, it could use its non blocking I/O model to prevent crashes like this
if rebirth used electron for its rendering engine
i think it wouldve been great
thats the sad part
hehe
bug-free and polished code
uh
they're not necessarily known for there
on the other hand, it's nicalis
¯\_(?)_/¯
ya know what i mean
that would become an "offical" bug
since moddig would actually be part of the game
well if it keeps crashing they just couldn't keep ignoring it
let's hope so
it might not even crash anymore
but that would again require actually reverse engineernig the game
but with ACTUAL mod support
you could try porting the engine backend over to mysql
that's unfortunate
Well...
it is quite unlike you'll be able to do anything like this
unless nicalis provides an abstraction layer
which are baked in to the code itself
it would be quite hard to set the spawn rate to 0% for default items
the problem is is that rebirth uses mongodb as a backend for the item pools
and just put the ancient one at 0% spawn rate or even delete it if it's possible
that does the same shit
it'll probably fix it, and if it doesn't people will make a new item
yeah
and with afterbirth+ around the corner it isn't worth it
like in original isaac
that would basicly be spidermod
that's reverse engineering the executable
a new mod
yrah
missinghud?
couldn't taht be used to create a new mod
the way people did the mod that show us the exact stats
But
someone would need to reverse engineer the executable to fix it
Right...
it's an executable issue
it's not an xml issue
because it isn't something that can easily be patched
but it seems like no one care about it
i looked for some fan patches
kinda sad
used to be my favorite item of afterbirth
I jsut avoid spider mod now
i think it also happened on windows
oh
yeah, although i'm on linux i had the issue as well
so you have the same issue ?
Well weird... Every threads i seen was about mac
that the never fixed
not a mac issue, it's an afterbirth bug
for any mac users
yeah
it just crashed
it's an age-old bug and it isn't just mac
but when the game have to show some bares
sounds like that spider guy isn't a good coder
that's just afterbirth being afterbirth
at first it's good
the spider mod makes your game crash
even graphics mod
ANY MOD
when you add a mod
(i founs some other threads online)
for evey mac users it seems
For some reason
there's some mysteries to be solved here
you are good
Guys by the way
oh
and crashing
preventing memory leaks
if the memory isn't safe it can lead to instability
rusts borrow checker guarantees that all memory is freed after use
?
what's the deal about the unsafe memory
its very sad
that's a bit sad for the actual good codders
as rust has compile time guarantees
But i just think about the possibilities
while rust has fearless concurrency, lua is singlethreaded and memory unsafe
I'll probably be able to do some stuff in lua so, so far so good for me
lua also lacks guaranteed memory safety and type inference
you see co-op involves a great deal of concurrency
anything you say
yrah
but not powerful
lua's easy
don't know about rust
lua is pretty easy tho
which are prevented by rusts multithreading library
lua causes great data races
Wel fuck ab+
doesn't have zero-cost abstractions
now lua is a simple interpreted language
it only supports lua
you can't for ab+
then you could create a mod with rust
Hum...
yeah
trait-based generics are necessary for co-op too which lua doesn't necessarily have
due to its trait based generics
with minimal runtime cost
with rust kilburn was able to run code deep within the engine of the game
rust also features move semantics
thats how antibirth is so expansive
which allows to access bare metal code
you would need to rewrite the engine for rust though
rust has efficient C bindings
you see
not happening
yes
as for the coop
If we could use rust language in isaac, everything would be better then ?
without pattern maching lua cant support co-op items
available in the more modern languages such as rust and haskell
a required feature of coop items is pattern matching
yeah but you are aware you cant make that with ab+ lua???
not really the most necessary thing but it'll be fun to play i think
But it's a bit of a bonus i agree
It's the kind of coop that is usefull cause you know some stuff can happens only when the two players are concerned
of each one power
some games did it greatly but for instance, trine's coop is awesome because of that
but some synergies could be fun ya know
true
i don't really see the point
portal 2 had amazing co-op and didn't even have exclusive co-op features
)
somthing that exchange position ? (maybe a bit useless
some synergies items
It's because these are items that can  only be played with two peoples
a brimstone laser pops between the player
everytime one of the players get hit
regardless i don't like the sound of co-op exclusive items
and the item would do:
well not the official one at least
It would be a mod, nothing ot do with the 1001%
the dscription would be "you ruined my run !"
yeah i'd be salty if i couldn't get 1001% without coop too
we thought about an item called "coop salt"
which allows writing more abstract code related to co-op
that's a horrible practice
why
specific to coop
it could come with some new items
rust has zero cost abstractions
well you see
since antibirth made cool coop
but the pvp mod couldd comme with other things
That's for the pvp mod
ab+ doesn't support rust however
oh true
as one of rusts key features are fearless futures
this sounds feasible if it was written in rust
Anything you say mister Programmer
as long as they're loaded in the same position in the array it would be trivial
yeah that's why it can compare times
But it has to detect which one has the fastest score
then basement 2, player 1 array
then when player 2's is done store player 2 data in the array and compare times and stuff
when basement 1 is complete store data in the array and load player 2's array
one array per player
you would only have one character however you would have just two data sets
Yeah
rotation would be easiest to program
Nad a nice hat
i mean it might not be the most difficult thing to program in the world
And you could choose the number of basement floors before the confrontation
like you can choose either split screen or rotation
but an option would be good
I mean it's kinda confusing on little screen
Yeah but split screen is no good
splitscreen with multiple controllers
or you know
or splitscreen with different keybinds
then it's the second's player turn
first player make the first floor
I thinked about somthing that would be like local
nah
online?
local co-op maybe
Not really
thus i don't know if it would be possible
it would also require an online communications system
so there would be a bit of choices to make
But each player would start with the "more options" item
of course it would be the exact same floors for each players
And then, the final confrontation
the first player to clear a floor wins a bonus item
continue
hmm
2 floors of basement for each player
It would be a PvP mod
Online i mean
people would probably try to work on it real fast
but i shall tell you guys about it
of courst i'm probably only dreaming
Beacause that would need some dope code
I've got a little idea of mod for AB+
Anyway
cause this wouldn't make sens alone in the basement
but then that doesn't go anywere
ok
hum
<@!142309138645516288> doesn't matter, that goes in <#207259602969034753>, <@175279786833346560> is right

removing the shading from a bony
ykno <@146070361929154560>
*lul*
with brown creep
we also could make it shit themed
you could add some half-open stitching to be in tone with the S.Womb theme
well yeah we're getting closer
by anus problems you mean some shit like this?

I just felt that a cut off the top would fit with the scarred womb's theme
chargi minaj
big butt charger
not a wide cut off the top
should be more of an anus problem
what if chargers left creep?

it's a good idea
ye
good idea?
which then explode into a spot of fire after death
that move while throwing their bones
but after detonated, turn into charred boneys
They act like normal before exploding
Im planning on upgrading the exploding boneys into military grade boneys

not the circlejerk of isaac
hell, this chat is called the MODDING of isaac
what the heck noodle
noodle only cares if modding is in modding, but he doesn't care about other stuff in modding.
kekko
the joke is that you told someone to move to this channel to talk about isaac modding and now you're the one going totally off topic
faeries
http://store.steampowered.com/app/536890/
No.
oh is it an isaac mod?
It really makes you think.
You should get it.
????
you ain't seen nothin yet
It's okay.
I played some of it.
Frog Fractions 2 is trending.
cool
Yeah.
is that like a lamb or something
Probably my best sprite
I thought you said there wouldn't be an update to Spook.
last season

There's the ones in my mod, and the unreleased ones.
I have shitty sprites.
in art shit this is all ive done
Yes ikr, but it looked shitty in 30x30
You should always work in a 30x30 window.
They look good, but I think they're too big.
Items I've made so far

Because I don't feel like releasing my other mods.
I made 115 cents.

soon there will be a very importanat shop item which costs 500 coins, I'm sure
how much are you making then finn
shows what you know

Just buy some babies instead of hoarding your money.
90 cents won't get you anything.
guys download my mod 10 more times
hot DAMN
OOOH SHIT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PAY RENT
update your anti
Not for me
notice how I said .3% as a joke to that effect
it exists
Only the nonexistent shop music
Well, you didn't do much.
I can't wait for my .3% cut of those antibirth coins
You'll need more than 50 cents to pay for rent.
i might be able to pay rent with what im making off these mods
nice coinage
this
Except maybe only three.
When they die, they should explode into ipecac shots.
They probably will work similar to lvl 2 flies and spits
All i really did was recolor, change the eyes, and add the drip
how will they play?
those don't look healthy
thank you
Oh, nice.
thats it
I did a shitty reskin

hah game playing nerd
But I have an update planned.
I didn't do anything because I saw a movie and played Antibirth.
nice
I practiced lua and I wrote some plans down and forged alliances
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR YOUR MOD TODAY?
AWRIGHT GUYS
Good luck guys
kk
Îm going to sleep
oh
Meat cleaver
do you mean meat cleaver or mom's knife
some guy in reddit did
Yeah anybody unlocked the butchers knife yet?
But the machete is pretty cool too
I prefer the butcher knife
But when you look at it the other way
At firdt i havent seen it
my opinion
make it look more like a machete
So if the machete is not a butcher knife
The fuck kind of dildos do you use
That looks 1000x better
ok....
Your machettes looks like a dildo
Just noticed
Thats a butchers knife
Lol

I'd say it looks like a butcher knife more
It doesn't look like a machete
give it a little shine
weird tho
the handle seems a lil
hmmm idk
that machete looks fine
i wouldn't make people pay for it
Yeah... Anyway people opinion on the machete need changes?
pfft
Good luck if you're trying to make that a mod, i Would pay for it lol
If you need any help with the sprites, just ask. I'm not that good, but if i can help
thank you!
lmao
That's a great thing you're doing here
o.o
would be hell
that
Anyway
"oh no i slid into a brimstone creep"
true
More likely to kill you
might save you from a few bullets you weren't paying attention to
true
A fun disadvantage, but still
It's clearly a disatcentage tho
People would be like "do i try it ? Meh"
i love ice physics
i'd totally buy it tho if i knew it was ice shoes
omg
Sadistic shit
"You put on the wrong shoes"
i imagine the item description
EXEPT IF IT LOOK THE SAME
Why Would you buy it lol
which put ice physics on EVERY floor
or maybe you could also get ice shoes
get it from a shop
But it would also free the ennemies around you
yeah lol
Or the object would be the torch
That makes you able to cancel the ice physics
Or an object
"Ski shoes"
You could find a trincket
Thats pretty cool
Yeah
he could have a non-slip aura
oh yeah
(Is melt the good verb ?)
He makes the ice on the floor he walks on melt
Or kill him but slip
And fight
So you could either live him alive
Of normal phisics
Could be fun if the torch guy leaves behind him a trail
Hum
except some places without ice physics
there'll always be ice physics
i'll do the inverse
and it makes the floor harder just by being there
Nah just some places would be better i think
That would be hell
because they piss people off
i was thinking of just giving the whole floor ice physics
oo true
Cause you'll slip on it
And you can hardly walk on it
Like ice ground
But there could be some frozen places
Idk
Yeah, might not be a good idea
Could'nt you expolde frozen ennemies ?
though i was condsidering just letting frozen enemys be thawed out with tears
True
get a chance at a few extra drops
you could leave them up if there's frozen champions
but i mean
that's the idea with em
yeah
It's makes a new game mechanic like, try to kill the torchman first
¯\_(?)_/¯
it's free and has everything i need
for sprites
i use paint.net
so it became a spider
"what if bomb was spider"
but then i thought
i was gonna make a fly carrying a bomb
That's tottaly new
My favorite thing is the torch man
I need to get a proper spriting program since i just use Piskel
thanks
lmao
i just love the fly riding the spider tbh
thanks!
Doin Great Winter!

It's nIce

It's refrshinf
It's really original and i think everyone would accept to give you a hand if they could
we are all too eager to see it to be denied
It's just so cool (pun intended)
winter will surely make a mod
Please do
Well if you do I would be glad to help since you have such great ideas!
i might try to make a mod
idk
Are you making a mod <@153966307593814016> ?
winter are you unironically making an ideas post for /r/bindingofisaac or something
I'm so hyped, make this a thing !!
Winter, it keeps getting better
Made my first reskin recently
http://i.imgur.com/XT13SAN.png
Yeah
That's cool
You know
Like reskins
But sprites can me mods
Me neither
Just sprite
Nah I dont even Know how to code
Ab+
You are working on a ab*mod
Ehhhh this is my TBOI sprite I have done heaps of other ones for other games
That soud nice
The enemy would appear at a rare chance after sleeping in a bed and would attach like the whipper guys with a machete<:whipper:259939519061688320>
Have you done anything else i could see ?
Yay
You

click the preset paint.net wavy button
so all you have to do to make that floor in paint.net is open dark rooms sprite
that was a nice meme
at one point pm2k and i had a godmode markov chain set up
Randomly changing things just because you can is ?
Now, I did say that there was lore attached to this.

But what is it, you might ask?

Well, there's FAR too much to explain here,
So I'll just give the jist of it.
the gold ui was fine
¯\_(?)_/¯
the floor in place of it was just STATIC AS FUUUUUUCK
because LORE
godmode lore

thats the point

antitale when cake
Antibirth
oh and greed mode is "you get no items in the shop and you fight 3 ultra greeds as final boss
only good mod
all mods are shit
Let's be real for a sec
When I saw the ui I played until basement and uninstalled so lol
when i add color, it won't be noticeable <@142309138645516288>
Well
i gues
hmm
shoot more
so
some had animation triggers
what the fuck purpose does the bird serve in the shop
or just reskins
<@175279786833346560> It was about time yyou realize that !
patterns?
did it actually add bosses like
and enemies and bosses in item rooms
it adds a few edgy ass bosses that are reskins with more hp, and the ugliest floors of all time
it looks like it has a fu manchu mustache
if i add 2 pixels to my revenant host
i just realised
that's cool
I couldn't bring myself to play it tbh
eye cancer
godmode added
uh
godmode chant
is The Agony Of Isaac
What did godmode add ppl
a really good mod i'm using all the time
lol change of subject
Yeah godmod is shit
^
heretic was the most creative mod at that time tbh
heretic is a good boss
Antibirth is a truckload of ***high quality*** shit
thanks cake~~
done
i made tale of samuel worship me
Heretic is also a truckload of shit
ok portal
Godmode is a truckload of shit
I hope godmode is removed once it's #2
cake add me to binding of undertale
WHAT IS HAPPENING
remove kebab
HOLY SHIT ARE YOU THE MAKER OF GODMODE
the creator of garry's mod
remove binding of undertale
the only joke here is appa
is that garry newman
Am I a joke here and I don't even know it
no
holy is that the maker of binding of undertale??!
That'd be the equivalent of an STD pajeet
binding of modding of isaac
i,made carrot mod
YOUR RANDOMIZER IS BROKE AF
holy shit I made isaac randomizer fuck me
portal have you told you to fuck off recently
***smooth***
holy shit portal you made character editor
*facesit me*
cake i cant believe you made binding of undertale please facesit me i want you
guys you are my heroes XD
I USE THIS ALL THE TIME
I actually made Binding of Undertale during my exams lol
dangit
lol get rekt kid
you mean the one with the soy milk-starting sans?
Tbh portal made character creator
I made that for fun
it's not a big deal
how much time you spent on it. ?
bruh
and copy enemies, but watch they be just isaac enemies with a different collor pattern and not a unique sprite
still can't believe you are the actual creator of the binding of undertale XD
Watch how they'll delay ab+ to copy some antibirth stuff
lol we'd all have antibirth anyway
hooooly shit
#nicalisgoesbankrupt
if that happens
nicalis takea antibirth without asking sells it for 10 dollars: the movie
hahahahahaha that shit was so fucking genius
yeah ? lol
photoshop is great, using it too
They are way better than what i'm doing
Because photoshop
are you referring to the ? shit lmao
My hosts take usually 1 hour
oh
by who
For the recolors about a second lol
HMM?
And also when I was in this server I was brainwashed but by a DIFFERENT PERSON
i depend
Hum... I dunno
Tbh until I joined this server  was brainwashed, portal
take
about how long does 1 sprite out of the shitload you sent
because i need an objective ore something
Why?
i wanna have finished my reskin before 1:00
they brainwashed people into thinking "mod tools" is something that allows people to easily make mods lol
Here it's 20:33 in france
I kinda died on the inside
oh man the mod tools thing is genuis
yeah...
:|
Also the tools are shit, but don't worry about it, your money will already be on our pocket when you realise that
^^^
AB+: here, you pay us and you also make stuff for our game
"
"hey i'll take your free content and sell it, bye
i just thought that would be weird for creator like
who cares
Skyrim: here, complete our game with mods
also antibirth isnt ab+ and nothing will top that so
dont forget then thinking about paid mods
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
but considering the fact that some of the best mod would be in it
Still it's a dlc for a dlc that adds PAID MOD SUPPORT
why are you even buying it
which... if you dont
I mean, i knew it will be expensive
9.99$ cost if you don't
6.66$ cost if you already own afterbirth
nicalis loves money bro :|
No, it won't
OMG
FREE
It took me so long to make this side xddddddddddddddddddd it's not like searched countdown creator on google or smth
will it be free with afterbirth or anything ?
I'm not sure how much it'll cost
oboi
guise check out my countdown for the dlc xdddddddddddddddddddd
IM SO EXCITED
oh myyyy
dlc for dlc
mmm
And the fucking AB+ apologists at the subreddit
true
8 days left
Doomsday is coming tbh
and when ab+ would be realsed, we'll add some new origanl bosses
I'm the gyros
?
dae remember sans undertale
You see wen can for now reskin it
and sans fight
Well it's not imcompatible
mettaton neo fight
wtf
nature girl
and maybe change the remaining to reskins for the time being
whats portals self insert
I wanted to replace the 100% chance to appear bosses with new, like, coded ones
i take that as a "yes"
fuck off portal
Looks absoltlly awesome
cake add my self insert to binding of undertale
Like, my idea now would be
Rightmost is a WIP Revenant host
I wanted to contact you when my bosses and stuff would be finished, but guess you already know now !
http://prntscr.com/do5tw6
I thought of going full on spriter but it takes me an hour to reskin a Host
?
Aw thanks
It's not a big deal
You done some pretty awesome job here !
Don't worry bout it I'm  just a spriter like you
That's why winter pinged me lol
Well... That's an honnor
Yes lol
are you the mod creator ?
Hear me out
Now that I think of it, only 100% sure to appear bosses will be changed
to your game ?
What do you mean addig bosses
Because like, people are saying the modding api is bad
But now I'm not sure
I said multiple times I wouldn't add bosses in bou until AB+
the one with it are just the one that are not done yet
But the point is
Nop
Just the eyes in the middle are not supposed to be there right?
Looks pretty dope

shit
that's an error page my dude
i just really don't know how to do with the legs tho

https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/5keh39/wip_request_the_binding_of_undertale_ennemies/
Here they are btw


Hum... i think i might know where the problem came from
I tried with flies and it worked too
Is there somthing special i need to do ?
my nex boss skin work but the little spiders just stays black
Also i quicly recolored some spiders (the normal ennemies) and it seems like it doesn't work
Its just really messy in there
i don't really know how to
I've got to work on the legs tho
oo ok
The original Muffet's pet only have 2 eyes
i already removed them on the 2 eddited frames
the eyes i mean
I'm going to remove them
don't forget the 2 eyes in the middle

My god it look cooler
I'm going to do this right now
Ok thanks for the support !
;-;
stfu edgequeen

binding of undertale expert comes in
so it looks a bit closer to the actual undertale enemy
It looks pretty cool but take the shine off his eyes

lttle update
Again it's verry ealry an the process but i wanna know what you thinking about the pixel art of the one on the left
And here's what i started to do

here's the original
I'm planning on remaking the widow fight to a fight against Muffet's pet
so can you tell me what's wrong, how to improve, if you have anny advice or if you wanna help me
It's still really early in the process but it's my first reskin ever
i'm working on some Undertale boss fights
Hey there
I will edit it tommorow
like the blade has to look worn
Remove notches, darken blade a lil bit, enlarge handle
Dang
Im still not happy with the machete godammit
blur ;-;
welp the host template i used fucks itself over in photoshop

Thanks for the criticism and help <@175279786833346560>
Happy Dance
Or get it added to another mod
Im really happy with this maybe I can turn it into a mod when Afterbirth Plus releases
Yeah
machete swings faster with tear rate
The mask would most likely would give mobs fear that look at you and it synergies with the machete to allow you bust closed doors open and do a bit extra damage
mask would give 3 black hearts and amp your speed and tear firerate based on kills, like a speed and tear related bloody lust
Nice idea!
enemies killed explode into blood tears that do 1.5x your tear damage
machete replaces your tears and swings in an 180 degree arc in front of you
Give me Ideas on what his items should do!



WIP
Jason Voorhees has a rare chance to appear after you slept in a Bed.
He attacks with a machete like the whipper guys. <:whipper:259939519061688320> 
He would drop his mask and machete.
Ok you got me. Terraria was fun
:^)
( .3.
***:^)***
... no idea ...
ye
Oh did you mean the other two
since you crossed it out
:^)
No idea
remind me of.
now what does this
http://prntscr.com/dnz5rw
thanks!
Ok, I'll give some of the whiteboard drawings a try ?
feel free to sprite the drawings I did on the whiteboard anyway though
Will probably be some time after AB+ comes out just so I can see what the tools we have are like
can do!
Nice! Well yeah, like I said, if you want a hand, send me a PM ?
and these items
well, introduction sprites, but the one on the right is not finished
I have these boss sprites
Anyway, if you want me to try my hand at some sprites, feel free to PM me with what you want and I'll try it out.
I know Python and Lua is sort of similar, so I could probably learn it.
only one
one sec
besides title screen
do you have any sprites done?
I'll have to learn how to code
the only thing I can do is sprite
I mean, i probably wont get it done though
yes, spriting help is always welcome
i could help with that too
<@!193893570061533184> you wouldn't happen to want some help with sprites for your mod? I'm not a master of spriting but I can show you some things I've done in the past?
in the mod
is it a boss even
but it isnt called the eye of cthulhu in the mod
well that was a redraw of an eye of cthulhu done from memory
i mean that eye looks like a 1:1 scale twin of eye of cthulhu
...maybe .3.
are these inspired from terraria?
http://prntscr.com/dnz1qx
so i took a look at the whiteboard drawing <@!193893570061533184>
No you don't ;)))))
what
i know where you got the demon wings from ;)))))
winter that's cute
she's also very polite
she dances to my music so
she's got good taste in music
fl chan is hot tbh
I'm lovin it
winter has gone full fl chan
that base seems too big at the top
i think it's the border
can't really put my finger on it
<@153966307593814016> something seems... off about the sprite
<@153966307593814016> winter aradia why are you green hair now
it can't not be edgy
ikr
edgy as always
more than just a host actually
http://i.imgur.com/zzhpw80.png
yep, that's a giant host
http://i.imgur.com/rGgkeE7.png
look at this boss i designed
lamp arg
ARG
(whiteboards are really fun to draw on BTW)
I mean, I added a bit more to it.

Sgt. Shroom is obscured by my lamp reflection, so, sorry about that.
you are?
looking forward to see more of it
this looks pretty nice
wow
But, I guess it can be poo pin
Poop**
SOLD
I just drew a pile of poip
IS THAT PIN MADE OUT OF POO ON THE RIGHT
Uh. I don't even know.
is that poo pin
Thanks
neat ?

sure
Mainly just to help me for boss ideas
Wanna see a drawing I did earlier today for this mod?
yeah i think that's even better than dark blue
Good?
there we go
I'll probably stick with that
This.
I think I found something way better though
i like it
oh there we go
How about that
no no no
a dark blue to black gradient
hold on
what if
wait
I prefer the black though
i like the blue one
~~why am i still up~~
i vote for blue
Or just plain old grey?
Too blue?
kinda
afterbirth was more of an orange
yeah but the antibirth red is more red
so was antibirth lol
plus Afterbirth was red
I dont like red TBH
maybe just hints of red
but a bit overused possibly
dark red also may work
works too
one moment then
or dark blue
if you're going for demon wings i'd go grey and black
dark blue tbh
If you had to make it a different colour, what would you make it?
I'm not too keen on the brown though
totally!!
you think so?
looks rad!!
I'm wanting to make a mod, How does the title screen look?
only _real_ goofballs can play _our_ crazy wacky mod!!!
We made our mod so wacky it crashes to desktop! Ha ha!
sounds like they're a little *too* insane
super insane special rooms crashes for me a lot, can someone help
I won't say you won't be able to do it, just that it's only conjecture that we will have the option
but only until destroyed
In this specific instance, it was used to spawn a poop, which does block pathing
it may or may not include obstacles which can disrupt pathing like pits
So you could emulate Great Gideon/Wormwood's pit spawning behavior
Bringing back a convo from yesterday, the AB+ API has a function which enables you to spawn objects to grid
^^^^
someone please replace beelzeblub with frampt
i think that's a mod already
make it so that everytime you die with the lost linkin park plays at the timestamp of 0:26 (If that is even possible)
https://youtu.be/Gd9OhYroLN0?t=26s
Anyone got any advice?
My current idea is to just make a mod if possible that makes either Antibirth or Rebirth save to a different folder, so that the two can be ran without any conflicts between one another.
I'm the guy that's working on BOIL Rebirth, which is somewhat up there on the main isaac subreddit ?
Hey you guys, is there an easy way to change the save path?
At the moment I've trying to find a solution for Vanilla Rebirth and Antibirth having conflicting save files.
As it is, Antibirth saves are wiped if you open vanilla Rebirth after playing Antibirth due to them sharing save files.
Damn! Thanks Wof.
its hardcoded. there can only be one starting room !
Is it hardcoded into the game?
But it didn't work
http://i.imgur.com/du19YYg.png
I've done this
Does anyone know if it is possible to add starting room variations with Basement Renovator?

mhh hmm
and press
when i go to the modding of isaac
k
can i... have some help e.0
hey guys
Just try it, it's nowhere near as hard as you think
It's following basic bulleted instructions
If that's "so much" to you then I don't think you're cut out for modding TBH
Ok but thatks so much
might be outdated in some ways
<@232727806755340288> https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/2n7pmk/psa_how_to_start_modding/
what do you want to "mod" exactly
ugh
if only someone would respond
yeah someone should respond soon
Maybe someone will know
Not rly unfortunately
You didn't find the answer ?
Can you help me with starting modding?  Please
Hi guys
<:plum:259939492008296448>
thanks
its fixed
?
wait
dont see winrar

nvm
browse?
you mean browese?
then do what I said once its downloaded
k

show in folder

and click winrar
and check set default program
wew
right click the file and click open with and click more programs
winrar
right click and open with
see, its notepad for some reason

okie
ok jus download any mod
dont see it
dont see ot
ok look for winrar archiver

no
uh
just any on your computer
mods downloaded in isaac already
as in
do you have a mod downloaded
wait I'm not sure you have to do all this lol
ok
ish loading
ok
click set default programs
oh ok
i have winrar
uh
do you have winrar or 7 zip or something

wait
i see it.
oh
the button on your keyboard
and ctrl v it in here
whats printscreen
click it and click alt printscreen
alt printscreen
h0w
wait send me a pic of what the menu looks like
yes
did you search default programs and click it
what next
windows 10 is good
wew windows 10
oh

start menu
what start ,emi
no
what
ok
you mean ctrl alt delete
oh
start menu?
search default programs in your start menu
whats funny?
lol
it opens to notepad for some reason
along with antibirth
along with some other mods too
for some reason it opens to notepad
when i download the binding of undertale
what do you need help with?
can i have some help?
and zooming out on witness
yeah
Also spike code right? There are spikes that have different timings
what i see as a big problem is the different size of the backdrops. in antibirth there are backdrops (walltextures) with double or 4-times the dimensions of the normal backdrops. i dont think it will be easy to port that feature.alone
yeah
or probably 100 other things
it wouldn't work with the ladder, for instance
true
Pretty much
that is disgusting
(I really hope that doesn't need to ever be a thing)
You could always have the destroyed tiles each be their own unmovable entity with collision so they function as impassable gaps :p
I mean I'm definitely sure it'd be possible, it just depends on how shitty and hackish you want it to be
there are lots of little things and many many big things which will need to be proven to me before I believe they're possible
kilburn had to rewrite pits and door/room spawning code completely to get them working
pits is a big one
will the api allow that?
however there are still some issues like spawning pits in the ground
gideon's health behavior in particular has a decent chance of being possible
(Again I suck at this so blarg)
http://pastebin.com/mVqD7DSn Here's the hothead example nicalis posted. If there are functions that can collect entities and segregate them based on if they're a vulnerable enemy, then it'd be easy to implement Gideon's take-damage-when-wave-is-dead behavior, right
<@128874748041101312> will be the judge of that
welp, that ping wasn't necessary though kek
o
he's just this guy, you know?
yeah pajeet knows a lot lol
<@128874748041101312>
whp is pajeet
can confirm
pajeet knows some things and some person
Oh, but pajeet said he had "insider information".
Here, one sec
<@!182509747835109387> , from the publicly-posted mod examples Nicalis has been posting
limt is a steam tester
Well I mean it's not even that it sounds trivial, it's that those functions are already accomodated by AB+'s API, at least from the examples I saw
Do they know people at Nicalis?
Also, where did pajeet and Flotilla get their information from?
and watch people struggle
there are a lot of things that still need to be done on improving antibirth
or just as-is
it would take a lot of effort to make his internal API ready for the public and easy to understand
see that's the thing, it sounds trivial but we don't know how good the api is
I mean he should release it
From the examples I saw in the API, you can set a cannot-be-damaged flag for any entity, and you can check the status of all damageable entities in a room. Why wouldn't you be able to do a check for damageable monsters, and if none are found damage Gideon and move onto the next wave?

I'm a complete novice with lua and programming in general, just trying to wrap my head around why this would be a complex thing
yeah he made a c++ API
?
he did, that's how he made antibirth
and then he gets grumpy
yeah if you don't have a chaos card you just have to destroy his morale by mutilating his friends
kilburn should make his own api
so in most cases, you can't hurt it directly
You have to tickle him with a feather.
yep
chaos card?
there we go
but you might never do it!
well shit
there's one way to harm great gideon directly
Also, pajeet said that you can't make a one time use active item.
that's where the complexity may come in
great gideon cannot be harmed directly, killing all enemies is what damages it
<@70946604139425792> it's completely different from the other bosses
i'm sure it may be a decent teaching tool if anything
This is mostly out of personal curiosity and not me trying to make a point, but what about Great Gideon is particularly complex?
but with how simple the examples shown are
pajeet said the API was basic and disappointing.
could be talking out of my ass
this may be an okay way to help teach lua to newbies maybe??
lol guys look isaac is 3d now
and not just "lol spawn a tear with some upward velocity every frame"
if tyrone wants to prove antibirth is portable he needs to show us a similarly complex enemy
^
the lua would need to be capable of interacting with practically every function and variable in the actual source code of the game
guilty until proven innocent
i'd love to see them port great gideon
sounds like my friday night
doesn't sound fun
100,000 lines of lua
this wouldn't be the first time, or the tenth time, that they have tried very blatantly to rip people off
IE "I didn't know Antibirth had custom stages/enemies with custom attacks/shittons of new items with complex interactions"
*glsl shader*
<@66197463593136128> It came from Tyrone himself so if that doesn't end up being the case feel free to start a pitchfork emporium. He's in the stream watching every last bit of the shit Cobalt is playing, so it's not like he's speaking from a position of ignorance
have fun rewriting a glsl shader in lua
I mean I can imagine outlandish but still possible scenarios in which it's good, and I've always said that, but there is no actual evidence at all
***PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT***
HA
did i hear something about ab+ being robust enough to port antibirth
SOMEhow
if the API somehow ends up being good then I'll be very surprised and confused but I'll accept it and I'll even gladly buy it
<:plum:259939492008296448>
just release the source code <:plum:259939492008296448>
and the fact that, at best, they have no clue how to show it off means that they don't know what modders' priorities are in the first place, which makes one further conclude that the API won't be very good
there's simply no excuse which would explain somehow both that the API is good and that they are advertising it sensibly
sanity flew out the window ever since 2011
this is nicalis though
yeah
any sane company with a quality product would be doing that
i think that would strike the best balance
i wouldn't mind simple showcases along side more complex examples
there is a reason for that
yeah
notice how no competent software tools advertise themselves merely by their most base capabilities
see also OP eden starts
we already have novices making mods
rip
why should i be interested
so if novices are going to be the only people making the mods
but showing a complex mod would not push them away once they have been shown that it can be simple
Because it gives the notion that "you can do this too!"
ANYTHING
Showing a dinky modification that's only 7 lines of script is more effective at generating interest from novices than something far more complex
something
true
but an example
sure, not the entire showcase
The examples he's given are pretty simple, but to play devil's advocate I wouldn't want to have a mod showcase be super complex if the end goal is to get your average player interested in modding
he hasn't even listed one, let alone demonstrated
just one maybe
you would think he would have one single example of the api being robust
im not just gonna take his word for it when all he's shown about the api is extremely simple shit
I was gonna ctrl+v but it's not on my clipboard anymore and it scrolled away, fuck
Someone asked Tyrone if the API was robust enough for Antibirth to be recreated in its entirety in it, and his response was basically yes
Funny enough I was coming in here to give a quote Tyrone said about the modding API :B
it's true
yeah but wheres the fun in that?
i just love my god damn negativity
You can just exist and judge it when it comes out
You don't have to be either, really
that'll only lead to disappointment
theres nothing implying that the api is good and ill rather be cynical about it than overly hyped
its late and im tired so i really dont feel arguing about this shit but
Unless you were one of those who got to see it in advance and recoiled in disgust? ?
That's a rather cynical opinion to have before it's out
oh true
it tells us how worthless it is
it does
but it tells us jack shit about the api
that looks pretty cool tho
that tells me *so much*
oh WOW you can spawn a tear every frame and give it an upwards velocity
can we take a moment and tell tyrone that this is not impressive https://twitter.com/tyronerodriguez/status/811394890881855488
that what i wanted to do when ab+ comes out ? (besides porting every other mod i made )
instead of having to hack the animations you could just (assuming nicalis isn't stupid) read what percentage the charge is at and dynamically draw a charge bar based on that
I can see an AB+ port to lua being pretty beneficial
chargeup bars work ? (kind of)
yeah they're pretty nice
For those who can't read it:
1 - Take an angel deal, then a devil deal.
2 - Don't pick up any devil or satanic items in a run.
3 - Beat [Redacted] as Eve on hard mode
I wanted to give modding a try, so I'm planning
hm
The Binding of Isaac Ascension
maybe if i could read them
Do these unlocks seem fair enough to you guys?
Ohhhh ok
it's for his game
What do you mean 24x24 pixels to work with? Isaac items are 32x32
maybe just cut/shorten the orange?
hmm
iit looks weird with it being longer on bottom
so just extend the lower part imo
but you dont get that luxury in this sprite
yeah the model is fine because you see the edges so you know its a hat
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/255458583200661504/260485320892612608/85px-Painted_Tipped_Lid_UNPAINTED.png its based on thisss but i only have 24x24 pixels to work with
to make it more obvious
make the lower part larger i'd say
can someone help me with this hat sprite it looks like  a uneven orange oreo
O
it is
I thought it was an eraser as well lol
owo
notices bad spritework
those outlines...
yeah
needs depth
me too
i thougjht it was an eraser lol
The banhammer's tears look messy as does the text
owo is alright
The blue one has too much contrast
Those sprites are frankly bad.
sooooo
his head is blue
Joe the guy named joe
and
Cool
Oh
but
his name is joe
Someone else's?
no
???'s?
its someone elses head
no
Isn't that Baby's Blue head?
So that's something
? <:plum:259939492008296448>
I thought they were from the game already
Yeah, they fit
I know that's the meme
??
i mean isaac
If we are talking about Barbie's Dreamhouse, of course
Sure
the game
Fit in what
do they fit in
i mean do they look good
?
that depends what you mean by good
Noice
owo
are these good sprites?

learn Lua so you can make quality mods for Afterbirth? ?
What should I learn if I wanted to start modding? Or is it better to wait for Afterbirth\??
its a completely diff title screen and intro omg
if the titlescreen is different? idk
antibirth
it?
question: how do you know if you have it installed
same
im busy playing antibirth ?
Make ?
make antiflash
i have practically nothing to do
has anybody nothing todo for the next 3 hours till antibirth release ? ? i have something todo ?
it says tutorials
pfff not big enough winter
Thank you Appa
see at the top
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/

i use ones this big
3x4 sprite sheet
tch
Could someone please link it?
what about it?
About that tutorial section?
So no worries there
I never read the readme
its like "DONT OPEN THE FILES YOU CANT MOD OUR GAME
igore the retarded readme in the files
Will do, thank you
look in the game files
I want to learn tho
ah
Dude, I am literally ignorant to all things modding right now
they contain just about everything for the game's assets
you know those .a files?
Unpacking?
Mind linking it?
for now you can unpack things
the modding of isaac subreddit has a tutorials section
Any advice on where to acquire said information?
I suppose I should learn the basics of modding first, then what you are telling me will make more sense to me
Really autocorrect?
Alright
yeh but you have to edit animation files to move the way you want to for spritesheets
example

Like, a sheet of all possible movements of said character
or 'frames'
put sprites in the squares
Because I might be confused and using the wrong term
Would an example help?
my spritesheet template for my game

idk how to explain
i just make a  spritesheet with big squares and tile them
Along with the knowledge to mod to begin with
I assume I'll need a sprite sheet
I have some designs I want to mod into the game once mod support is official
what do you mean?
How does one go about creating a sprite sheet?
thanks for the warning
gotcha
thats what I feared ?
works for rebirth prob not afterbirth
!OUTDATED!!!OUTDATED!!
anyone know if this works?
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/571/agony-of-isaacheretic-merge-outdated
anyway, back to my heretic question
ok then
oh
nobody knows about most of the bosses
nice
the new secret boss is better then the Gurd then?
Far more unique than your usual isaac boss
it makes you wonder how the official bosses got away with being so dull
the bosses I think are maybe the starkest upgrade in antibirth
thanks for telling me
okie doke
^
you won't miss urgurdy when you play, the new bosses are excellent
yeah it was a mock up from like 2 years ago
rip
also yeah urgurdy isn't there
;-;
personally i think antibirth is *the best* expansion the game has seen
aww
ur-gurdy isnt in the game
I wasnt asking for spoilers
not even spoiler
anyways
oh, well yeah
no
no
no spoilers before launch
its not?
no
so you testers could prove if the Ur-Gurdy is a thing
robobaby rude
Better than afterbirth
As good as rebirth imo
jeez
Yep
imo anyway
almost bigger
agree
cant wait owo
damn
rebirth to antibirth is about as large of an upgrade as flash to rebirth
speaking of heretic
btw
i hope he pulls thru
thats terrible
aww ;;
been in a coma for a month
pretty sad
he's now in a hospital
he had a stroke
by beta testers
yeah
hes surrounded
a stroke? .w.
i'm a beta tester too
have fun
i'm a bit late but
Yep
well antibirth isnt comparable to any of those so
Sadly its creator turned into a stroke
meh its boring but its ok i guess
I really like Heretic
Thankfully anti doesnt have many useless items
Heretic is nice tho
you'll get used to everything in time
same
pretty much
so anti is gonna straight rawdog me
ye
that i couldnt play
it threw away my eyesight
what a *fucking joke* of a mod
it hurt my eyes so bad
lol godmode
godmode threw me for a loop
theres so much new shit that its hard to get used to the learning curve
?
exposed again ?
dont fall for the silver tongue
lol limt has it too
It throws your skills for a loop since its all new n shit
same
im jealous
I wish I got an early copy
well shit
im cool
so am i
so am i
im a betatester ye
pm2k back at it again
ohno
i am abad player
you've played it? o-o
So no worries
Antibirth made us all look like bad players
.w.
just wanted to say that
so yeah
im not amazing
im a decent isaac player
if you guys come to the stream, don't expect greatness
so, just a little info
XD
same tbh
jerryman sillyman
hi
jerry ?
i gotcha, thanks jerry
jerry
added
thanks for the invite dude
ah
This is jerry
<@66197463593136128>
who be jerry?
jerry?
replacing them worked owo
well shit
Unless im forgetting something
testing
And vice versa
You can of course add mod As entities2 file and mod As rooms folder, replacing mod Bs
ok
If it adds rooms with them
Just replacing one would cause the other mods entities to break
if replacing messes them up
worst thing is that i have to reinstall the mods
should i try replacing them first?
im comparing, and the files look indentical
And the needed gfx
And then only install saviors players.xml
Install agony
You could do something likr
Or
Then youd need to manually merge those
should I just let one replace the other?
well, both mods have the file entities2
I cant remember if savior adds entities
i made it work once, but I cant remember how I did it
^
Mmmm merging mods is kinda complicated
or rename and keep both?
should I replace them?
when i try to add both into resources, it tells me they alot of the file names are the same
brb
alright, I'll try that now
Maybe check in the players.xml if the items are missing there for some reason
so, everything is unlocked
ive 1001%ed it
Mmm
That the char supposedly starts with
of course
Do you have the items unlocked
Agony, with Savior
sorry for not mentioning that .w.
uh, with the savior addon
agony is a "dlc"
it doesn't
You sure agony has its own characters?
agony doesn't have reskinned characters
any advice on how to fix it?
i had an issue where the characters appeared with their reskins, but not their items on spawn
so, question for anyone who's played Agony of isaac
this is about isaac
anyway, enough about me
i mean, I have over 1,000 watchers, but i still dont understand why .w.
^^;
lol
#loser
im on dA
aww
same
But I never used it
I have a 8 year old DA account
oo i only have 2 of those
Cake, got it
cake~~
Call me cake sweetie
Sorry, Cake'
Rip? lol
Rip, are you on dA?
I don't think anyone will mind if you're not pushy or anything
Not the pixel art
but yeah, I can link it here
Send me an actual design of the character and I'll do it
i didn't want to advertize .w.
winter pls
Good idea actually
I want to see some receptioms to anti
i legit almost said underhell
cake draw hellbound
sure c:
Make sure to link it here
Yay was going to draw digital but realized my FUCKING TABLET stopped working
anyway, im definitely gonna stream it tomorrow
haha
lol
sorry, didnt mean to rile up the chat
yeah, no need to theorize XD
Resist the urge and just chill
it's going to release tomorrow
Yeah just
leave the nerds to speculate i guess
of course not, they created an entire new stage in the mockup, my theory is that the Ur-Gurdy will be at the end of it
yeah dont spoil too much
let's not spoil everything
pfft
Keep guessing
what is this, xml modding?
it's its own individual thing
its own thing
Nope
nah
nope
Replaces chest?
fuck this
Cool
it's an actual chapter
it's not just a boss room lol
Hehehehe
lol
Dont worry
it isn't
even more of a reason for it to be the Ur-Gurdy
cake fuck off
its not
no
If the chapter is just a boss room like hush I'll be dissapointed
Perhaps with intriquite design in the original file
Hey it's not secret final boss it's secret chapter
New room
true, however if its a secret final boss, where else would he spawn?
to be fair this talk should maybe be in the <#259601511523287040> channel
He is not in antibirth
Hush is for afterbirth
Ahem
WAIT
FOR FUCKS SAKE
CHILL CHAT
same FUCK HUSH
antibirth has no hush equivalent
AHEM
It's rebirth mod
its not hush all over again ill tell you that much
fuck hush
the mockup is legit as it is
That'd be better
what if this will replace Hush
If it's hush all over again I'll be VERY dissapointed tbh
?
I think it would be a little too obvious to just have ur gurdy
and this
http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39739506749754218/7637819361AF8033FDACF7EEA234086EDF132F3F/
and the boss is a big 2x2 room fight
ye
http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39739316358274982/98FCFA27DC340264652C2CDDE897AFBE4285CF71/
here's the mockup
"when life gives you lemons, throw them out the window and make a mod for Isaac"
Still haven't received mod-making lemons
wtf
that'd be cool actually
Sag said she didn't do any sprites tho
ya
ooo
what if it's the Ur-Gurdy?
wth
well
we've heard
ye
https://antibirth.com/
a secret one
and anti says they'll be a new final chapter
the site
i dont :/
well, Sag was behind it's concept
Send me the antibirth link pls
think
one thing
Guys one think
we all know sag
I heard of it
S?gitarius
who here knows of the Ur-Gurdy?
regardless
I cant spell DX
the lead sprite designer is NotYourSagitarious
lol wat
so, Anti
nice XD
sure
ya
hey, can I share a theory with you all
surfer from hell
there he is

actually i only have 1
yes plz
who wants to see my hellbound enemy concepts
they're from like what 4 years ago
i want to mock you
cake post
But it's nice to see the difference lol
ah, they can't be that bad ;w;
wow owo
they're fucking atrocious
When I started drawing
I have concepts from when Isaac first came out lol
thanks everyone ;v;
yup the last one is amazing
they're my concept, and my friend drew them
love that one especially
yes
that last one man that's fucking awesome
thank you ;v;
holy shit i love those
same
his head would separate half way thru the fight
Bruh I should draw on pc more]
that makes sense
I feel his patterns would be like a Lamb/Angel mix
good work, hope you can manage to put them ingame in the future
ikr
lol yeah
That one looks like the cover of a metal album or smth
that would be cool to see ingame
Acephalous
that's pretty metal
Holy shit
vine is my favourite tbh because edge

ye theyre cool!
really like the first one, the horseman is alright
hey those aren't bad
oo
wtf are you talking about
However, Vine is a demon in mythology
Vine is dead winter
Thos are actually pretty cool
He should

go ahead
hope thats ok
i was told to post mod designs here
I finally finished the discriptions for all trinkets and items ? ab+ can come ?
We officially have more gameplay footage of Super Mario on the Nintendo Switch than we do Freedom Planet 2 footage
Besides, there's apparently a playable build and everything. It's just that Strife (guy who made FP) isn't showing it because reasons
i mean 2
can't wait for freedom planet forever
Quite honestly I am actually burned out on Freedom Planet by my own doing. Honestly just trying to finish BoA because I feel obligated to
No shit.
that's not a good sign
i mean come on now
been a whole year since that game was announced and we have exactly 0 seconds of gameplay footage
bitch we're still waiting for freedom planet 2
maybe when freedom planet 3 and knuckles comes out
riiiiiip
port to antibirth or dont even bother
shill
it got updated and is now not in MoI's servers.
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2059/the-binding-of-avalice
ACTIVATE BINDING OF AVALICE SHILLING
your meme has arrived
you should try it sometime
its a pretty nice meme
i heard of it
ahh yeah that antibirth meme
~~ikana ban this kid~~
noodle dont ban me for this one
?
No, fuck this, I quit
seriously tho its almost 2017, the word "meme" is pretty much synonymous with "thing" at this point
meme
got it
a meme
so in short
A ***game mechanic***?
what else is it if not a meme
What the fuck is this "meme" word abuse? ._.
yea alright
yeah
"meme"?
But would it let you fire at an angle, for example?
VATS is that fallout meme isnt it
active item, pause the game, select a number of enemies based on tears stat within range, fire higher damage tears at them with hit chances based on their speed at time of pausing and angles of tears to be shot out arbitrarily, unpause and fire all the tears
VATS?
And if yes, what would you base it on?
Like, would you make it full-on VATS copy, with hit chances and stuff?
The question is how would you handle it
maybe not with ab+'s shitty api but...
potentially pretty easy
I wonder how hard would it be to make a VATS mod for Isaac
C should get lost at sea tbh
true
the mess that is C strings makes me wanna stay away from it for an eternity
i just cant stand C really
you know, C++ have more things than C
m9
use fortran
And I've heard a lot of good stuff about Rust, I have to try it someday
Everybody keeps saying C is the best, but nobody can list an advantage over C++
fortran
Rust
the best is brainfuck
rust
(but old)
C is the best!
who cares its shit
EXCUSE ME IT IS Lua
<@126590786945941504> what's with lua? ?
it's Rust
no
But, let's be honest, the best language is still c11Plus+
leu
lau
it's nice language
i love lua language
i love lua
it's a language for pro
lua chant?
uh actually it's Iua
xD
Now you pissed me off
It's Lua, not lua
It's a damn name
Names start with a capital letter dammit
sheesh, the people these days
**lua**
lua
Iua
new copypasta
lua
sheesh, the people these days
Names start with a capital letter dammit
It's a damn **name**
It's **Lua**, not **lua**
<@173420370773147649> Now you pissed **me** off
i can help out with that
na. im remaking the External item descriptions mod and i wrote a list of all item descriptions that the mod will use. you have to read thru dat list and look, if something is not understandable or what could be improved
to make it approved? <@!174193097285173250> 
no, but i can provide crash logs and things like that.
does this include proofreading a mod ?
yo, if anyone needs someone to test their mods, feel free to give me a call, a'ight? i'll be more than happy to.
but when you break the game...
since you rarely have that many items in the room, the nearest few could work
maybe i could do that the first 5 items will be displayed, and when you press F1 or something, the next 5 items will be displayed ?
yea you can delete comments on your workshop posts
hold on
i think
> steam workshop
you have ban rights on steam workshop ? didnt knew that
yea you have the power for that
Ban them
nearest few will be maybe the quickest solution. but then i get comments like "FUCK YOU! WHY ONLY THE NEAREST FEW !!!"
and "tabbing" through every item in the room is to slow ...
that and fuck knows if the api will support it cause isaac doesnt really use the mouse
best would be, that you can click on an item and get the informations about it. but i dont know if the cursor is activated for every isaac user
maybe only display the nearest few?
or jera
OK yea fair point
more than items 4 in one room = diplo + chest room 1
xD
your fault for using shitpost mods
https://moddingofisaac.com/modfiles/bbb2c5cc157c/screenshots/1.jpg
just how often would you have more than 4 items in a room
but if you have too many items in the room...
It looks great
i got it now. can we get back to my problem ? ?
LUA Uppercase Accident !
Lua Uppercase Accident.
i sometimes spell it LUA to piss off lua shills
The programming language is named Lua, it is officially not a acronym.

Lua is a common word meaning Moon in Portuguese. The language is named like this because a previous programming language at PUC (in early development phase) was already named SOL for Simple Object Language. And since SOL means Sun in Portuguese, its successor has been named Lua as a joke.

An interesting backronym has been invented by the Lua community to ironically explain that Lua is not an acronym: LUA would stand for Lua Uppercase Accident.

Historically however, LUA used to be an acronym in Portuguese. It once meant Linguagem para Usuarios de Aplicação (Language for Application Users). The acronym was however never used in English documentation, because it would have been hard for non-Portuguese speakers to understand it.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13615975/what-does-lua-acronym-stand-for
lua
it would be love u always then
LÜÀ
you = u

Love You Always

not an acronym
lua not LUA
oh?
no. i have a lua blackbox + photoshop ?

kilburn fucking sucks
dont worry
We got a whole channel for it
:v
But then I realized that kilburn's in here
Oh hey, I was about to ask how people felt about antibirth
we'll add it to the site later today
that's actually an oversight yeah, sorry about that
is that on the website?
yes. it says 20th in the video description. but as i said in my original comment, _it is not on the website_
should probably be in the website too tho
its in the vid description
20th dec
<@167363485326508033> the website doesn't actually include the release date. is that an oversight?
make inflatable sword an item
the way you shaded it right now makes it look like an inflatable sword
a blade like that has a very distinct kind of shading
look at references for the shading too

oh my lord, the antibirth thing looks pretty cool
we can all patronize the fuck out of him
even better
kilburn's actually working on a patreon i believe
that covers the entire screen
noodle add in a giant block of text that begs the user to ~~donate money~~ go to antibirth
do it
true
every week
it should be mod of the week
what about that isaac modding page
and yeah it should probably be pinned

portal pls
he made Garry's mod
yeah listen to this man, he knows all about modding
if it was that powerful they'd have shown more than just tutorial-grade items and enemy reskins
the whole lua support thing looks quite limited
and judging from their code so far
other than extremely simple examples
because they've shown nothing of the actual scripting capabilities

~~sue~~
?
?
wow!
that's it
it's isaac character editor except you can create new characters
ipecac mod
what if ab+ was just a slightly modified isaac character editor
because theres nothing else to choose from*
? also a lot of ms paint sprites that will get accepted for the game because tyrone thinks it looks good
"le buffed lost"
"look at my super cool item +10000000000000000000000 damage super balanced samp son starts with it"
"someone gift me ab+ if you want ab+ support"
im thinking about just replacing my description with like
there will just be op items and shit
isaac character editor ab+ will be best mod
Everyone who would make mods isn't buying it
Nobody
yeah, i really do wonder who the fuck are going to be the people who'll actually end up making decent mods for this shit
It's beautiful
Yeah
i fucking know right?
it never fails to amuse me at how much the actual modders hate ab+ and the people who know nothing about nodding shill it
So well have tons of OP START mods with a cool extra corruptor function
remove circlejerk items like jera, blank card and brimstone
omg
inside job
Corrupt a few parts of the game as a little bonus
riddle that shit with bugs and blame ab+ on it
yes
should i add gimped ab+ support to isaac character editor ?
lmao pm2k
<@153966307593814016> thats why i prepare every mod of mine to be uploaded within the first 3 days max ?
Heck id maybe buy it just to mass produce a bunch of terrible mods just to lower the average mod quality, making ab+ even more unappealing
they'd just port mods without permission tbh
just so all the morons shilling the mod support would only get awful meme mods
honestly it'd be best if it stayed that way
i will buy ab+ so somebody is there to raise the bar in terms of quality. else, all we will ever see are meme mods and OP mods. ?
yep
and it was just open-source isaac
wouldn't it be fucked up if ab+ was good
I have 0 intention of buying ab+. only if we are completely wrong about the mod support being terrible
and there's nothing else
because hey it's more isaac
people will still buy ab+
at the end of the day
I love those new faces that show up here excited about ab+ just to be reminded of the harsh reality
ysy
sys
u suck
not for ab+ though that's gonna suck
I'm going to make a supreme excellent mod
i'm making an undertale fangame and i despise it
i'm incompetent and i despise it
just about every remotely competent modder despises it
reminder: this server is ab+ hate central
A post detailing why it sucks :)
a mod that removes everything
So, what're you guys gonna make when AB+ comes out?
so I don't know
1035/1055
It never goes to 100%
It says 99% on the status file
Drag any of the .a files onto "Gibbed.Rebirth.Unpack.exe" located in the bin folder of the extracted archive
How do I use Rick's Unpacker?
I'm back
thanks
Fine

nicalis gave me syphalis
all hail Queen Sag
nippalis bad company
gosh
fine
don't actually bow to me pls
*bows*
never again
*bows*
nicalis would rather credit a pile of dookie than someone who gave ideas
trusting nicalis was a huge mistake
no
bow to your queen
But Nicalis didn't credit you, right?
yeah say hi to sag, aleeh
just a lil on the low side
yeah that's pretty good i like it
Cool! You helped on the game!
ye it's good
hey that doesnt look too bad lol
who needs necks
no neck bony
ingame ?
ME
tyrone is such a tyro
self-centered cuck, tyrone is
Who's sag?
pfff
because he thought he was worthy of the artist role
Yeah host hat that's it for the most part
tyrone credited himself
because Nicalis didn't even accept anything she did for Afterbirth
she contributed the host hat
notice how sag isn't in Afterbirth credits either
^
that's nicalis for you!!!
There should be at least his name there
yeah
But he helpe to create the original game!
his credit was taken out of the game because of that
Oh ok
yeah
Florian never worked on Rebirth.
maybe still working on eternal edition secretly but i haven't seen any videos about that for a while
not rebirth and its dlcs i think
The game as a whole
ah
I meant Isaac itself
what project was it?
Ok
Oh
ah shit
<@160981982849794048> Tyrone is listed as an artist in the credits
on what?
I think
Florian is still on the project?
Could I ask...
I think so
i thought other artists did
did he even do any sprites
Tyrone's spriting is really lazy tho
yeah those eyebrows look more agressive
I need to start doing reflash stuff again lol
and theres a lot of shading
lines are a little thin
~~id like to help tbh~~
lookin good ?
Maybe a bit thicker?
I found the word!
there we go

hell all you need is a stylus at that point
I t's actually easier to do pixel art
I know
you can still draw with that
I use only my notebook's touchpad
oh
But I don't have a mouse too
I know
it only helps out a tad
don't need one
Altough I don't have that fancy drawing tables
here are some activation codes ? :

this one
Oh
http://macromedia-flash-8.soft32.com/    should be legit enough
That macromedia etc etc
ohh
For flash
what, i.imgur?
Non-trustable
The sites that appeared look a bit...
Can you give me the official link?
like the 2nd one
http://i.imgur.com/dK8uTbu.png
oo i think they could be a bit more angular
Oh
rough
Having an uneven or irregular surface; not smooth or level.
Thanks
But yeah
I don't know what rougher means
i use macromedia flash 8
I don't know if rougher is even a word
also i'm pretty sure it's done in flash <@221628025463111680>
You also could do them a little bit rougher
they look a lil too high imo
tho actually could you try lowering the "eyebrows" on the 1st one
What software did you use?
i love it
That's really cool
ye that's good
??

??
i think that looks much better
?
there we go

ah i gotcha
yeah
oh you mean there was too much shading here?
all i remember was it had little to no shading
ah
i forgot what flash shading was like
but then again
i meant the sprite being shaded in general
oh yeah maybe give the mouth some shading
it's the shading that looks off for me
yeah maybe a smidge closer would do it
i think the mouth looks fine a tad crooked, it is flash afterall
move them closer
The mouth is a bit off, I guess
bigger eyes
might be the eyes aren't big enough?
looks off to me, but i cant say why ?
is this good enough ?

OMG! I just noticed that your icon matches your mod! Genius!
I was mostly joking but https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/408/pitch-black

let's see where they go with it
?
umm. mods? this person is stealing my mod?
????
gay in the box

by the time you get to the end of an average isaac run a flight sim is less boring than you probably are
i wouldnt
The boredom of a regular flight sim with the added nothingness of Isaac.
if nicalis makes it
*i would buy isaac teaches typing*
hell
i would buy first person flight sim isaac
*who gives a shit*
dude
who gives a shit
they could come up with lore for why if you find the devil room in the dark room isaac turns into a first person flight sim if they wanted
they could do any shit they want
just because you can draw a line between the gameplay and the lore doesn't mean it's the only way the lore could have been framed within gameplay
Dad left and the only thing he left behind was his key the end.
and it has opertunity
the whole dad story seems unfocuses
i dunno
that lore makes a little sense barely
i guess its ~lore~ or something
2 b gay
why do you even need the polaroid to go to the chest
The polaroids have no reason to exist other than to he*k you up in the future.
we still don't know if there is going to be anything interseting or challenging about looping at all
im pretty sure you can take the polaroid and still go to the dark room
That's another great example of l o r e ruining the game.
how the hell are you going to know if you're going to want to waste more time with your dumb op character when you're choosing the polaroid or negative after mom
It's a shitty way of fixing the two paths.
too many people going to the chest
I'm fine with it. The Dark room was never used.
dark room needs more love
what the fuck is that
was it a fever dream or did they say that you're going to be able to loop but only if you go to the dark room
<:robobaby:248868379287486465>
god
are you questioning the lore?
he goes to dark room not the chest
that lore doesnt make sense tho
care about a different game instead
why don't we all just
Lore.
lazy
why not atleast like a red chest or some shit
why does a chest drop after satan
something that never made sense to me is
ye
arent those literally the mom legs
fallen is just in the corner
oh god those legs are so bad
2thicc4me
he's just watching or something
thicc ?
so we can fix satan's horrendous legs
and the fallen is there too i guess
im so glad that ? is coming out soon
rude
and then he becomes ur mom
he takes up half the screen and then he just fires a spread attack
satan just skips leg day
(idk why its a trinket but okay)
satan is really badly designed
serious work outs
thankfully that they're adding a *trinket* which gives you an item room in the womb
appa misses those thicc fallen angel calves
his legs are so skinny now
i miss satans flash graphics
why not just have given these to me on the previous floors
and then any items you may have missed it just gives back to you in the chest like ???
shops in the womb wouldnt be broken but it took them so long to add it
I'm going hard 80 on this
It completely removes any reason to explore the floors
80% of the bosses suck in general
Yeah the whole no-items-past-the-depths is so bad
and so you've just got these two chapters with one of them being never visited and both having the same awful boss fights at the end
i *still* dont get why you get items in the chest and you fight more bosses in rooms
i like dark room a lot visually, and the music STARTS OUT good and creepy then gets a little ruiend with their dumb random sounds and static
it's all vague and nonliteral enough that I think you could bullshit just about any gameplay you wanted if you had to
the two paths dont make any sense from a gameplay perspective
the story actually gets in the way of the game a lot
yeah and it looks cool
he has a dash attack?
I didnt know he had a dash attack until like the 30th time I fought him
i guess hes ok
maybe i just dont like his music
the lamb is well designed
lamb is kinda weird
imo i really like the lamb more than the blue bab
idc about lore lol
But you see, the lore.
isaac but with some homic tears and flies
instead of
i really wish ??? had more depth or more original attacks
Remember when Edmund made a blogpost about how final bosses were a mistake and then he added Ultra Greed.
ect
theres coins and slot machines on the titlescreen, coins in the credits
i like how in afterbirth they reaaaaally tried to force the greed shit
butt
ass

is it too late to abort tyrone?
i still find it funny that tyrone credited himself
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
defining
no you suck at it
its shit
ill define it rn
me
but who can define art
i still find it funny that tyrone credited himself as an artist when hes probabl t he ones tat made all of the unshaded sprites
maybe they actually changed their name to ass
wonder what ann did
thats just rude
also they changed "Ann" to say "Ass" in the credits which felt weird because the game is swear free and doesnt fit in
now that I've made it cool again
Swank is definitely a word that I use
I think he looks dapper as well as swank
yeaaaaah
The lines are too thick and there's too much going on.
because fuck consistant art syles lets insert a dev in an anime costume
The credits are unreadable even without the out-of-place garbage AB added.
daily reminder that this unironicaly got through to afterbirth
they would if they could
what if you have naked people with sacks on their head
Trailers are typically not ESRB rated.
play it loud because the beat is rare
also the rebirth version of jesus loves me is great
Their trailer is not the video game.
well now we have LOUD bad credits music
i thought they used it in one of the trailers
Like that's going to bump it up to AO.
I like how their reason for not using the Jesus Loves Me song for the Rebirth credits was that it might change the rating.
what
probably derahex tbh
?
rip in hell damned soul
but you're going to hell sorry
no
wow hes really chaotix
Chaotix4 weeks ago
is it weird that I'm a Christian but I love twisted shit like this.
I can rock out to this
ohhhh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSmGiLBbZU even the guy who coded isaac said this was a bad idea by edmund lol
I'm a mom trying to act like someone's dude
I don't believe you
no
aren't we all just dudes trying to sound like someone's mom
but at our core
tru lmao
But she also doesn't sound like a dude trying to sound like someone's mom.
well in professionalism yeah
Well it's a step up for sure.
sounds like too young
ehhhh i dont like the rebirth mom sounds
why does mom have tiny ribs inside all of her organs anyway
Who even voiced her?
The old mom voice was so bad.
not very good

tale of samuel more like tale of samusmells
http://i.imgur.com/YRQciKc.png
its called lilly now but ye
Is that where that picture from the Tale of Samuel comes from?
oh cool
same, i hired the ab cutscene artist to make cutscenes and art for my game sorta
The rebirth ones were pretty gross but I liked the artist they picked up for AB.
i was susprised by how much of a step up rebirths cutscenes were from flash
it was way more whacky than the original opening too
and mouth movemtnns
yeah
like the arm movements
the cutscene animation looked pretty bad tbh
but now its just generic flash
the old, "vectorized pixel art" look was really cool
i really dislike the art style
maybe ouroboros will suck so much that no one will ever want to see steven again
the far apart eyes and thick rectangular mouth are what makes steven Steven
should have just drawn a border around what was already there and colored it in
the eyes/mouth on the old sprite were pretty much perfect
it doesn't have the personality of steven
it's like 200 times better
~~a steven reskin that could rival the likes of the binding of steven~~
What are 'events' in animation files?
^
:) the binning off isek: aferberts makes them more unique :)
I thought it was ? for sure
no
?
i forgot about the name and i cant find it
what was that mod that made afterbirth palleteswaps look more unique called?
take a look at how the book of belial does it
I would remove the corner pixels on the cross, or make it a really light color
no problem
Thank you very much
Really
Since I use Paint Tool SAI I'll have to use Photoshop to integrate it
Thank you
original size
Thank you
It's really good
Oh
maybe like this ?
The part where he is looking at the sides
I can't do the inverted cross on his head

A sprite
yes. whats the problem ?
Can someone help me?
and there will be functions to get an item's definition from its id
they'll probably assign a generated id to them
although it does make me wonder how they're going to handle custom items
if you can't, that'd be pretty sad
you'll most likely be able to get their position, type, variant and subtype
well you can iterate through all items in the room
its possible. would be pretty fucked up if we cant even read what entities are  in the room
Implying ab+  API will even be able to see what items are in a room
External item descriptions: Version 4  (AB+ mockup) ?
Oh, definitely
yes i very much think so
Including the external tools, also the other afterbirth+ modding features
Do y'all think rebirth-style modding stands a chance against the Lua API?
?
Bored spriting

this is very relevant to modding, sir

<@!174193097285173250> Do you want item ID's as well?
yes ?
You are remaking it?
no. i just have to type all the item descriptions into a file, so i can read that file with ab+ version of EID
Oh yeah, I can't copy to collectibles because the item sprites don't exist yet.
would be a lot easier
i wish
Platinumgod already has items from AB+?
Oh, that is easier.
no. copy/paste the item effects into a list. but thas even easier
I can do that.
Copy and paste to the sprite in collectibles?
<@!182509747835109387> you just have to copy/paste from platinum god ?
I have a feeling some sort of deus ex machina is going to save me from having to deal with it at all when I make mods
<@!174193097285173250> How much knowledge do I need to help you?
sorry I refuse to prepare for ab+
anyone bored here ? i could need some help for EID - ab+ preparation ?

Well, limt balances it out.

yours arent that bad
Don't worry. My bad sprites are keeping the good ones in balance.
best sprite
nothing will top this tho
idk actual spriters doing shit maybe
*quality of sprites that are posted on the discord servers
wow what a fucking difference
thats like saying this 15c ramen tastes better than the 10c one
people are getting ready? idk
saying the quality of mods increased... ISNT SAYING MUCH
becuase afterbirth is coming to town probably
umm
Also, I like the costumes. I'll probably only remove the ones that interfere with the sprite.
why is it that since the last week, the quality of mods has drastically increased ?
binding of transparency
because I havent colored them yet
<@!129339380090404864> Why are they all transparent?
nice
http://puu.sh/sMdYD/86711c48df.png empiric done 28 sprites left
yes you can
(you can write any other character for that "2")
Can't you replace it with anything because it will throw an error either way?
here is the thread where i created a file with every costume disabled https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/4g5716/removing_all_costumes_easily/
costumes2.xml -> to disable: replace anm2path="..." with 2anm2path="..."
Except for Eve's Head
<@!174193097285173250> How do I disable costumes?
ask cake anyway
Cake hates me because I said that Boku no Hero Academia was bad.
ask cake
idk
By eating yourself
How do I disable costumes?
good sprite
this one was really hard to make
http://puu.sh/sMd1n/26b7548cbd.png black box done 29 sprites left
Then What's the Point
The head won't change because of Eve's Head.
ur not playing a mod any more
but when your character turns from your bo bo monkey to just isaac it's kinda like
I like the crazy amalgamations of Isaac created by the costumes.
Nah
whatever
it's flawed in every way because of items like brimstone and tech x but
do what binding of undertale does and make items not change your costume
maybe eventually
lmao the reading players.xml has been broken ever since the rewrite and i never fixed it cause xml blows
It reads the players.xml already there, and if it detects any changes between that one and the default one, it asks the user if it wants them combined.
that sentence hurt my head
what do you mean
<@162156525337575425> Make it so that it copies any changes from the original to the new one if you choose.
Yeah, but Isaac Character Editor rewrites your xml.
thats what isaac character editor does
-1
I just need to add "_white" to the end of the character sheet and change the xml, right?
ofc you will
I guess I'll change the skin color to white.
LMAO
he'd set everyone's skin color to white if he could
unless you plan on changing every cosmetic item that shows skin that isnt going to happen
Yeah, but I would rather have the area be orange.
I think you can do that?
<@!182509747835109387> set his skin color to white
banned
This looks interesting.

Yep, top one is unused.
that wulf reminds me of this video XD : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jq06Ga71TM
Because that's what I'm doing with the other sprites.
<@153966307593814016> That doesn't work with the item pickup animation.
yiff yiff
?
o shit it's yiff
dont move an inch
that's what i do
sprite sheet
give the character maggy hair and put the head over the maggy hair
just like
you may or may not have to fix it with the anm2 then
if your head is bigger than normal
remove one of the heads and see if it works
i have no idea
Oh, so I don't need to edit the animation.
one of them is unusedi  think
Because the bottom head is used for item pickup, so is the top head useless?
<@!129339380090404864> What's the difference between the top head and the bottom head?
<@153966307593814016> That's what I'm going to do.
oh I see, I misread
<@!129339380090404864> There is no problem with item pickup.
then edit anim 2 file
whats the problem with the item pick up?
I can't without editing the amn2 file.
I am not that stupid.
make them not overlap
Yes.
you have overlapping sprites
It appears fine when he picks up an item.
Is it any easy fix?
Hmmm
you would have to change the animation file to fix that

so dedicated he launched isaac twice
I'll try to get a screenshot.
The left ear appears when the frame from the walking animation appears.
what?
Is there any way I can make this so that the head doesn't overlap with the body?
2 shades on the char skin is too much?
make it lighter around the outlines
inverse pillow shade
Don't pillowshade.
Almost done with the head part
I'll do it later
Eh
pillow shade it
how
make sprite good
Can someone help me?

I'm brazilian
I can't understand

make isaac randomizer run off of a neural network
They just seem a bit strange sometimes
just need to learn a bit
They are not so bad
I mean
Nah
has best sprites
download isaac randomizer
Going back to my sucky sprites
Anyway
My isaac sprites suck >.<
<@!182509747835109387> lacks explosions but else its fine ?
p good
Is this good?
Oh.
it was months ago soz
<@162117085428842496> Link it.
btw
you say 'either' but
i saw someone who added blonde hair to megaman with no shading and a t-shirt and called it a original character or some shit
its either minecraft or just really shittily done
nothing good comes from google imaging pixel art
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
banned
also i wanna mention that these sprites im making are not for a isaac mod or whatever they r for my game but theres no art channel here
even better
http://www.deviantart.com/art/Time-Freezing-Stopwatch-606848444
first line of google images -> stopwatch sprite
coolstlevania
?
http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/videogaming/images/d/dd/Stopwatch_Castlevania_Sprite.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20140816155335
?
so i need to make a 32x32 sprite of a stopwatch that isnt a ripoff of isaac stopwatch sprite
oh, guess you're done
cant
make it less weird then
looks weird

well in isaac the benefit is that in the middle of the action the entities are slightly better defined and easier to keep track of
yeah try the inside imo
becuz why not
why did you decide to have a 2 pixel border on everything anyway?
but it looked bad when i made it blue
right now its just pure black
should i try to change the inside of the jacket

yeah I'm not very good at explaining things
and im not too sure what you meant by "i would lower the width of the borders where they meet the rest of the sprite

see if that looks better
i would lower the width of the borders where they meet the rest of the sprite
o ye
the darker blues look too saturated
it could definitely be better
does this blue jacket thing look bad
it really depends on what youre doing
usually I dont
sometimes I draw a big picture and scale it down
yeah whatevers comfortable tbh
it just feels weird as fuck to me
i dunno maybe its just not my style or something
thats what a lot of spriters do
i de-saturated it a bit
i dont do that at all because thats dumb
he draws a big piucture and scales it down
he does spriting in a weird way
and
doesnt talk about shines ns hit but it teaches basics
Thanks
it teaches almost everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ68vYqzSm0
watch leathers shitty video
;-;
I need to learn so much about Isaac spriting
^ 3 shades and a shine

also the bottle has 3 shades and a shine, thats normal for isaac
I do 10 shades because I hate the Isaac shading.
Normal spriting stuff
I said it
thats how isaac does it
the colors are each 20 shades apart
It's just normal spriting stuff
Don't mind me
Well
are your eyes like disabled or something
Kinda hard to look at all at the same time
A bit too different colors
MY EYES ARE STRONG
I mean
No
my eyes are strong
doesn't hurt my eyes
4 shades looks betetr imo
it does not look like a cylinder
Yes it does.
It kinda hurts the eyes, y'know?
But
wtf this looks awful it doesnt even look like a cylinder anymore
It's good for me
your gay face has 3 shades
Yes
Most sprites have 3 shades.
the sky's the limit
doesn't seem too saturated to me
3 is not better lol
aw.
3 is better.
It has 4 shades right now.
barely
*
3
question : with modding , can you change game mechanics?
no 4 shades would look bad
Condense from 4 shades to 3 shades
And I can't understand how to use Rick's Unpacker
A bit
is this power drink bottle too saturated?
This is just "training"
Just starting
bleh
so
also the sprites resource sprites wont work in game
As I said, I'm new in this area
I don't plan to get it ALL
Because you need them to mod the game
To get all the resources
So, why should I be unpacking the game?
Because I can't sprite anything, but I can make decent sprites for this game.
Yeah, I think spriting for this game is easier than normal spriting.
And if the costume is bigger than Isaac's head, put it in the blank or Eve's Wig costume.
i dunno i find this game to have not that complex of an art style but i dunno
I'ts pretty hard
Just remember double outline and shading
But for this game
I'm quite good at normal spriting
I'm new to isaac spriting

I think I'll just do it
I don't know
you should be unpacking the game instead of using spritersresouce
It is white Book of Belial?
uh
(Did just 2 parts up there)

But it looks quite neat
I dodn't do much yet
k cool
I came back to spriting
For some dumb reason
remove youtube
delete youtube
i love this youtube mod
so yeah moddings
YouTube should go back to 2001.
let's start fresh
deleted everythign that got posted since then
YouTube should go back to 2005.
youtube should go back to 2008 or so
like when they were improving the player ui
you got a Secret Glimpse into the upcomming update
Oh well.
Weird, it reverted back to the old one.
youtube heros
remember when youtube did x and people were upset
i dunno why that happened
yeah i was gonna mention that
remember when youtube finally fixed comments and people were upset
the new layout looks better
that was said about like all the youtube layouts
the current layout is fine tbh
<#205854782542315520>
yeah and then a year from now you'll look back at the current layout and say "that looked pretty gay"
disgusting
woaH

looks the same
New YouTube format is weird.
this one doesnt even have the metal strips at the top
always has to be vidyagame refernece or it's not good ?
thanks cow rulean
oh shit
they all look the same shape
its a biker helmet
You got it mixed up
?
It's TJ "Henry" Yoshi
It is Hotline Miami.
no
is that some streamer
looks like Henry "TJ" Yoshi
hotline miami invented bikers tbh
i dunno
just a biker helment
hotline miami?
does this look ok
Ew no
make your own face into a sprite
It looks ugly.
But shading on white Isaac is way too dark.
?
first off, use the lost/other white colors because there is almost no difference between the shades

and then you got it
Is this good?
just think like how nicalis would sahde it
dunno if thats proper or not
id do it below
i was joking
how is chad pillow shaded
<@162117085428842496> How do I do AA on the mouth? Does it need shading above or below the mouth?
you can barely see it in game
fuck
v  horrible sprite
pillow shading
thats in freon t of him
whats so shiny in his eyes
god see a dentist or smthn
that's one ugly fuck
cuz look at this mouth

They aren't even comparable they aren't the same type of games at all.
?
if lilly doesn't get at least a 85 on metacritic I'm severing all ties
this is still about mods right?
Yeah, it shouldn't be too hard if the game sucks.
sure but it's good advice in your case
well its still a dumb argument
since you are making a game
you deserve everything that ever happens to you for making that argument
to be fair appa, you should at least be trying to make a better game
Appa is correct here
make a better game like fuck off i hate that argument
you used the worst argument
THAT ARGUMENT
no you fool
LMAO
everything he says
<@162117085428842496> Make a better game.
its bait
^ exactly what i mean
the game is ugly
So there is a point to this image.
lmao
its best to ignore him when you speaks his mind
no you are

ok whats the point of this image

but its both
they arent they same thing

I hope I had your Isaac-spriting skills. I can only do normal pixel art
well
Simplistic and ugly are not the same thing.
holy shit rythem heaven is ugly

These are my favorite Neopets.
I knew it
Yes, it's a Neopets game.
I heard it's a neopet game
o
its a neopet game
sounds weeby
the fuck is rhythm heaven
<@145740433165647873> I don't know. It's like that on the wiki.
is that some neopets game?
It is from Rhythm Heaven.
why was the white bg very poorly erased from the original image
It is a neopet
No.
is it from a kids flash game
yes
No
its a neopet

Ok
It is a monkey.
For me, it looks a bit like a monkey
by god he actually did it
Uh, is it a monkey?
he's too afraid
he'll never ask
now would be a good time to ask something
Sure.
Could i just ask something?
Looks a bit better
It looks slightly better now.
hah yeah
It looks weird now.
if you just looked at the side view without the frontal I'm not sure you'd realize the mouth is a mouth and not a weird nose
do it, if you dare
I think I need an orange line in front of it to match the other face.
I take no particular issue with it
So the ear is fine now?
brisk is equally ?
publix sweet tea is ?
^
^
have a nice tall glass of iced tea hehehehe
yeah hahahah
Any other suggestions?
getting there
Yeah
Like this?
It doesn't work in all of them, but if you try mine, try doing the ear the same size as the original one ( the front one )
ears go inwards after all
<@182509747835109387> Leave a pixel border of the original color in between the black border and the shading
Also
I'm confused. What do you mean by a one pixel border?
both work though
I think mine would fit more in isaac though
or that
Yes
Just shade the ear a slightly darker color but leave a one pixel "border" of the original color
But you can see it
It's a bit small

Try doing something like that for a sideways ear
Anyway
Not a Isaac spriter though
Sure.
I am a spriter
Can I help?
I think the ear needs shading, but I don't' know how to do it.
Oh
Is this better?
I think, I had to resize it so its a little iffy
well first off the ear is two pixels shorter on the side
im not a spriter ¯\_(?)_/¯
So I need help.
I don't know how to make a sideways ear though.
http://i.imgur.com/UlwKsPD.png change this part somehow idk

come back soon
Bye
any time
Thank you, then
I see
bad
pretty much all you're getting is an animation editor
Yes.
and the room editor is a downgrade from what we have now
dont expect much out of that
like the modding tools are just room editor, animation editor and item pool editor
Ok
We know you can do more stuff, but we don't know if the stuff we can already do will be easier.
Explain, please
depends on what you expect by "easier to mod"
eeeh
Yes.
And it's gonna have its own modding tools, so it's gonna be easier to mod.
Yes.
Afterbirth + will use lua, right?
Well
Sure.
Can someone help me?

the mouth definitely looked better 1px thick
most of isaac's sprites dont even have shading at all
s:
I don't feel like finding the sprites that break the rules though.
smh
not everything
>most stuff
Light source is from the top left.
Most stuff isn't pillowshaded though.
pillow shading is a bad way to shade even a pillow tbh
without pillow shading
resprite everything in the game
That's how Isaac's shadow looks.
i mean
It isn't pillowshaded though.
do it without pillowshading
only when you do it
It looks bad thicker.
Weird.
<@194259969359478784>
Wait, did he leave the server?
old game
sad
bad
@epicbob57#8905 This is what it's based off of.
:>
ahh! this would be torture if I really cared!
the binding of dont starve
mystery
won't say the name tho :>
I think I know what ciirulean is working on, by name
oh
preorder canceled
?
mystery for what?
its a mystery
sprite for what?
done with the 89 items i need to sprite
^
done for what?
I am almost sort of there
56/89 items done
the mouth needs aa is all
make the bow 3x bigger
the mouth looks to thin to me
?
gud
<@!109513677132005376>

The only problem is that Maggy's Bow is tilted.
it can be ridiculously oversized
actually a pretty good idea
But does it fit on his chest?
yes ?
copypaste one of maggy's bows and slap it on isaac
uhhhhhh
<@!109513677132005376> How would you draw this?
All else fails just have it be a 2x2 block under his head.
I overestimated the amount of room Isaac's chest actually allowed for.
http://puu.sh/sKsQK/298cbdc58d.png You could have it look like this and leave it assymetrical but idunno.
Hmm...
It looks like an H.
Dunno who he is but just by using a quick google search it looks like all you need is two triangles.
But Isaac's chest is only two pixels.
<@!182509747835109387> I would suggest making the bowtie on Chorus Man a bowtie and not just a line.
perfect
<@!109513677132005376>
darken the shade a little more
yes
<@!109513677132005376> Is this good?
just orange
if you want to stay close to the source material
But which is better: orange or orange-brown?
there's barely any contrast between the shading
Is this better?
the shade should really be more visible
Oh, okay.
yea but we're talkin about *isaac spriting*
But it's supposed to look like this.
it needs more contrast
yeah
for the orange
make the shade darker
DO YOU SEE HOW SHITTY THAT MONKEY SPRITE IS?
no I'm really not
You're better than me.
why me I'm like the shittiest at spriting
<@162117085428842496> <@128874748041101312> <@!109513677132005376> Help me with these terrible sprites.
Version 3 (mouth moved up)
Version 2
Also, any suggestions for the monkey?
I just reduced the bowtie to two pixels, but I don't know what else to do.
Any suggestions for this sprite? It is supposed to be a Chorus Kid from Rhythm Heaven, but I was having trouble with the shading and bowtie.
thanks
i wrote a tutorial on them. but no one reads them anyway
yes. they are xml files with a different file ending.
anyone know about anm2 files?
got this message on the facebook page:
`hi, i have to ask you a thing, i need a gif of the coin beggar while ita takes coins, i tried to make it using the frames of the sprite but it's hard, and then i took the animation file (.anm2) but i don't know how to export it ?`
like shit
like gonorrhea
That works. How would it look?
gonorrhea
What would be a good name for an item that gives tears a chance to turn enemies into poop?
okeay
then stop trying because its just embarassing for everyone involved
DO you?
i try
ifunny.c?
meh
you're not funny either
ifunny.org tbh
but it isint funny there
they're so unfunny that I haven't laughed at things I would normally find funny if <@!234312332107317248> said something recently
oh you'd fit right in
you'd be perfect on r/funny tho tbh
i know
you're not funny
i cri

tbh having ? in your name is a bad meme tho
^
you'll understand when you're older
it's one of the best memes there is
nahhhhhhhhhh
? is kinda a bad meme now anyone
?
stop trying to replicate the ? meme
I'm telling everyone it's great
i dont really
nobody cares what ?? is if you dont tell anyone what it is
everyone cares because it's so great
ahem
that was a load of shit
what
nobody cares what ?? is if nobody knows what it is
and because it more aptly describes the awesome power of ??
no I renamed it because the new name is way better
? when
did you actually fucking rename it because i figured it out
?? when
what the fuck is it
also it won't be finished until next april
big announcement, ?? is rebranding and is now ??
>pillowshading ?
someone do it become profesional at art
i want isaac to be like this

But I bet it would be hard to see everything with no outlines
hire heart machine for a mod
There should be a no-outline mod
can we please get a pillowshaded of isaac mod
yes
spriting is hard.
http://i.imgur.com/sFP0nDD.png
? ?
ab is an insult to ????  then
? is all flags mixed together to make a superflag.
but what is ?
You don't need a mod for that. That's what AB is.
i want a mod for ????
nah
eventually there will be a mod for every flag
pajeet stealing credit again
?
whataya mean thank pajeet
i linked the website to make the font ?
Winter ?
my pleasure
Thank pajeet.
i made the font >:(
whaddya mean thank portal
any time
<@145740433165647873> thanks
don't mention it
<@145740433165647873> thanks
?
no problem
that works pretty well actually, thanks
oh wow
there's the isaac font alright
Thank Portal.
<@129339380090404864> FOUND IT
look piss kid, you broke his spirit
i dont need it really
its really no big deal
it has to be like ttf or ott or something
its not something you can install though
Yes, that is a font file.
fnt
Like this?
my issue is turning it into a font that i can use

Ask Portal. I think she might have drawn the other letters.
yeah
This font?
I didn't stop him because I'm an asshole
he misunderstood your issue because he's a buffoon
¯\_(?)_/¯
sorry, what do i do with this?
not my problem
You do it.
now make it highlighted
Oh, that one actually worked.

<@129339380090404864> Ask Portal how she changed the text in Character Editor.
thanks anyway
no it was the previous one i was looking for, that version is just super aliased and warped
http://www.dafont.com/8bit-wonder.font
yeah idk, that looks pretty funky to me
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1701/team-meat-font
is there a good team meat font that exists?
ok
Remind me tho
I'll repro when I get home ?
aight
Ye ill go check it out
prob ab+ will have a hook to play sounds but not into the music lol
Oh also Luke I left a bug report for the alpha on the discord testers server the other day, could you see if you can reproduce it? It was already submitted, right now it's got five people who could reproduce
And <@173206704849158144> not possible yet. Not without modifying the alt. music which effects normal runs too
<@!123641250879504384> yeah it's really annoying
Switch the files
No, as in, the music that plays for Burning Basement plays for the Basement level, and I want to change it to the one that plays for the Basement
That may work, I wouldn't know though
Replace the Greed mode music file with whatever music you want?
now how do you change the greed mode music
k
Android alpha has a bug that gives you a notification thing when someone does @ here or @ everyone but it doesn't work
I'm so triggered rn
@here how do I change Greed Mode's music to the regular music? (Like instead of Burning Basement playing for the Basement level, only the Basement theme plays)
<@129339380090404864> my tag for him is "I'm 14 and controversy is cool"
dunno if it'll get anywhere
yeah
is the "satanic" mod and whatever it was renamed to still a thing?
I bet he has a solid 7 diary entries about it
but "lol i dont care"
and he goes back to gungeon and rags on our staff team for a literal entire hour
for a good while
for stirring up shit
we banned him from the isaac server right
yo like
i just find it funny how basically everyone hates him
something traumatic must have happened to him
dude's obsessed with 14 yr olds
he's like 12
he's really fixated on the age 14 http://i.imgur.com/L6BrFce.png
like is he not aware that everyone assumes he's 14?
he's so clearly projecting too
yup
lol the flair
holy shit
good

show
yes
or somethi
<@162156525337575425>  do you still have that picture of zatherz post saying "edgy 12 year old fuckers
like can we talk to a sub mod about him? Show them some of his posts?
i dont remem
banned from internet
or kicked
he was banned from the isaac server
i have no idea
??
why the fuck hasn't he been banned?
no one ~~in the isaac community~~ likes zatherz lol
no one in the isaac community likes zatherz lol

cause we all need reminders that the world isn't perfect

I looked up his Reddit account and it's just edgy comments about deporting immigrants lol
portal why would you remind me that zatherz exists

pajeet
unless you only have rebirth because pajeet is too lazy to write a rebirth compatible version

download isaac randomizer tbh
cinco
thanks
vyacheslav_mescherin_orchestra-penguindance-op42emaj.ogg

ah yes
diptera sonata in G minor

opus 42
ah yes
you mean Vyacheslav Mescherin Orchestra - Penguin's Dance?
to know the name
i want to replace it but i dont want to unpack stuff or download anything
can anyone tell me what was the name of the title screen music?
uh
wait
good luck with spooking!
Aqapack is good mod.
hong kong 97 has better music
no
was about to mention it lmao
...aqapack?
Now make a mod that replaces every song with 7 Grand Dad.
bootleg
what a meme
why
i once made a mod that replaces every song with hong kong '97
also
yeah
because it takes no effort
yep
also there are like 300 mods that just replace one song
that
oh yeah
brutal doom tho
the only mod that makes you extremely overpowered and is fun is russian overkill for doom
because thats the isaac audience in 2016
also why are the mods that just make you op so popular
ok
spooking of isaac
hey i havent actually played any isaac mod in like 423 years tell me the name of a mod that makes the game harder
could be worth trying though, plus people can still choose not to use extra hud
that would still have the problem of having pixelated style and new style on the screen at once
oh, I'm not sure
the rebirth item icons for the hud and the flash item icons for pedestals
which original small hud icons?
since the extra hud is hardcoded, i cant "unblur" that shit... should i reuse the original small hud icons for that ? <@145740433165647873>
the actual progress seems to be pulling off the flash look though, with individual sprites
blurry hud items, the clutter on the screen in this screenshot esp the hud, the mix of remade and old pixelated items on screen, and maybe this is true to flash but the stage seems really low contrast
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5gh2q8/what_are_the_odds_of_this_happening_a_normal/dasc1g1/
Yes it looks kinda ugly. i think its because of the blurry item icons. or is it something else ?
loved that mod
no way, spooking of isaac was really good
not like a single good mod has released
to think this is what it took to get them to notice a mod for once
isaac randomizer has the most karma on subreddit other than the blog post
that should be red flag material
hooboy
https://minecraft.net/en/addons/faq/ tfw minecraft fucking pocket edition has better looking mod support than ab+
Damn, tried to do Ventricide, sounds awful
at one point
I told you explicitly how to do it
I don't know how to
oh
I don't feel like it
<@128874748041101312> just hue shift it programmatically you dip
make me a better version of isaac randomizer with a few of the recently discussed hotfixes and then upload it
I'll make you a mod
I'm making a mod
you can shift the hue of an image, I believe in you
why do you want the dice
I'll just work on my shitty opengl game
ok
nope too busy
with the randomizer's icon
<@145740433165647873> send me 10 different dice with shifted hues
thank god
the music
<@145740433165647873> it works
splendid
which was making a message box appear
and I found a fix to it
I tried to add a warning at the start which says that it'll take a while
WEW
I think I may have done it accidentally
fix it
aaaand it doesn't work
Which is why I am starting with boss fights- they are the shortest and are more melodic
However, the percussion features would sound really dummmmmb
But that's lazy
so I might just choose the most melodic one of the three (ex being Necropolis, Depths, Dank Depths) and use that for all of the three
The sucky thing is a lot of the floors are mostly just percussion features
?
that's why you stab yourself to get stronk
Yup, haha
no pain no gain
If I do a famitracker cover of one song each night, it is going to take me like 40 days, RIP
yes
Just have a timer count down for a few milliseconds before running the work
Nono I'm saying not to sleep
not sleep doesn't work
Use a timer
Not sleep?
yeah but what else
sleep doesn't make it wait, it makes it freeze
it changes to done at the end
no
well...
sleep
in what way are you giving it half a second
giving it half a second doesn't work
nope
you need to give it a spare millisecond or two to update
it must not be waiting after the change and before the work
Rewrite in Rust tbh
but it's not
I am
Or just rewrite in Rust
^
yeah you need to change it before the work and then after
but not when it's frozen
oh it does change
but I'm sure you'll find some way to convey the information that it is in progress
well that's bizarre if true
doesn't look like it
at least I don't think you can
you can't change the button text
auto minimizing prob makes people think it's done or crashing or something
minimize will work if you ever add in breaks for loading progress or something
it's less important
not me at least
no
do some psychos actually use that?
yeah but you can't click the minimize button
I was able to click or tab out of it just fine
<@145740433165647873> you can't minimize the window while it's working, that's why I had that feature
defualt recommended done
good cool
double click done
I warned you!!!
shit my brain is already getting used to c++ and I'm using c++ shit in c#
rip bootlegs
not any more
I thought that was china
america's dearest ally, scandinavia
Yeah he scammed the mayor of Scandinavia
they are pretty dumb
you must have scammed a government official at some point
I didn't know that scamming was illegal
they forget to check
how am I still getting customers
yeah you're number 12
I am?
you're on the CIA's most wanted list for scamming
shit how'd you know
no you don't you're 7 years old
I remember those days
o ok
just make it burn the mp3 to whatever cd is in the drive
playing the music is
a toggle isn't the hard part
Then again it's also .NET
It's a toggle
and easier done than said 3 times fast
What
easier said than done
those are my conditions
otherwise I'm not having it sent to vinesauce
keep it disabled by default but add it in
Yes
no
and most importantly, add in the music
alright then
Then don't minimize it
don't make it do that
but the randomizer minimizes and you can't see it
he never put in any breaks so that it doesn't freeze the whole time it's working
<@128874748041101312> Then do what 0x0ade did for the Mod the Gungeon installer. The icon's pallete changes colors every frame its working.
<@128874748041101312> and then promise them a free shoe shine if the program doesn't work
quickest easiest way to convey it
make it so the 'RANDOMIZE' button changes to 'Working...' or something before it starts running and then 'Done!' when it's finished
alright I will
only if you download isaac randomizer
pajeet, add a 'blank' preset, make it so that the 'recommended' preset is selected by default, and make it so that you can load a preset by double clicking one rather than needing to select and then press load
you expect people to read on moddingofisaac? lol
yeah let me add something to the program to notify the user when THERES HUGE ASS TEXT TELLING THEM RIGHT HERE
I suspect that that person made an error
the user*
the mod was so bad it killed itself
what the fuck
lol
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5g9tmz/isaac_randomizer_almost_a_new_experience_every/das171h/
agreed
yeah the outline at least
lines are a bit too thin
well put
its not flashy but it is flashy
sure
is this flashy enough ?
saggy
That looks like Sag's artstyle.
gahahahh
shit there are like, 2 wrong notes that *really* stand out
I will probably change some things in the future but I just made this tonight https://soundcloud.com/hux52/crusade-rebirth
Turns out I already did the drumset in the past, at least a simplified version, so I will be lazy and use that for now- I want to sleep
make me a midi of the community remix version of tomes
The drumset for the Rebirth boss theme is going to suck to arrange
Yep, this is Robo-Baby. Saying something completely unrelated.
i bet u like risk of rain
Oh wait, this is Robo-Baby. I forgot.
?
Wait, Appa thinks something is good?
the original song is good tho
Original != good
it's probably the combination of the basic synth and the pitch
if not an octave higher than that
But I might
I mean it's that high in the original, haha
I'd just drop it an octave
Should I make it quieter, I'd assume?
but otherwise good overall
Ah, okay
one thing I might change is that the very high pitched melody at the beginning is sort of grating
so I will save those for last, probably
The floor songs take a looooong time to do
I think I am going to do the Rebirth boss fight song next
Thanks!
this sounds pretty catchy though, seems like you're onto something
don't worry about posting whatever if it's in the right channel and doesn't break any of the lax rules
I am doing this for a mod and was told to post it here- if you would like me to remove the embed or remove the post entirely, I can do so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXwjOfnNK8A
Shortstopper?
is that supposed to be the gun that scout has thats really shitty
that's the best thing you've said all week
We need to make a mod that gives Isaac a gun and replaces Mom with Tyrone.
that's what we need
found something old lol
nice
it's legit
last drawing for today ?
np
ok, thanks, Wof
it will stay like its now. i like it enough to not longer care about that ? 
That makes it only 40 more enemies to go !
original
which is why I'm saying to make it darker ?
If memory serves correctly Nicalis heavily shaded the mask
its the original shade ?
Other than that it looks fine
You might want to make the mask a darker shade
<@!66197463593136128> hows that ?
JINGLE OGG/boss fight intro jingle_01.ogg if you mean that music that plays for nightmares
which of the track id is for music between floors?
they're adorable
last spider sprite for this mod ?
new enemy: balloon
a balloon which just sits there but if it takes damage it sprays out brimstone blood behind it and flies around the room erratically for 5 solid minutes
looks good enough i guess ?
the rags need to be the lighter color
...Or any shading, for that matter.
Edmund didn't use much shading on flash sprites.
That one's good.
or even less ?
Better.
better ?
i havent done shit for reflash in the past 4 weeks or so. i dont have holidays anymore ?
? reflash
On that note I should start doing stuff for reflash again
*too* shaded I think
what do you think of that ragling trite ?
hah well memed!

it's in rust
Is this in C#?
i wrote this
gotta love ILSpy
I Spy is a game in which you say "I spy with my little eye..."
It downloads Isaac Character Editor
allows to look at decompiled c# code
It's a program
whats an ILSpy ?
and ^
<@174193097285173250> ILSpy
no
it's closed source unless you ask in person with the apparent intent to help fix this horrible mess
Am I allowed to skip the Rick's Unpacker part if I already have unpacked files?
oh
it's Closed source
I'll just upload it to hastebin
<@!128874748041101312> where can i look into the code of randomizer ? i want to know how you guys execute ricks unpacker shit ?
¯\_(?)_/¯
are you high
the fuck
Yes.
what, the packed .a files?
why the hell would it delete original game files
If it deleted the original ones.
how would it fuck with your game files
copy
<@!128874748041101312> Does Isaac Randomizer fuck with your game files, or does it create another copy of them?
but i just unticked "always ask" and it stopped
that popped up
oh lame+gay
and when i did it
it opens rick's unpacker a bunch of times
because when u click randomize
i think they mean this
http://i.imgur.com/Y23VAia.png
or
i don't know if they mean like the administrator thing
a normal windows operation
isn't that just
unless you pay like $60 a month or some shit
shit no fucking clue but you cant get smartscreen to go away

true
ab+ is just a mundane shitty cash grab
i'm not memeing
"cherry mod"
now is not the time for memes jerry
watch out for his new instant classic
ab+ exists
i mean
imagine the kind of person it takes to put this much time into producing something so completely and ultimately horrible

i think we should appreciate what the modding community has produced in all these years
#nicalisgetssyphalis
#nicalisgetscholera
#nicalisgoestosomalia
afterbirth_unpack/resources/gfx only shows anm. files.
it's the thought that counts
i wanted to add #nicalisgoestosyria but character limit
<@!128874748041101312>

In the unpack? Mine just shows anm. files.
gfx\characters\costumes
Costumes mostly.
which sprites
Oh. I needed to be more clear. How do I find the sprites in the GFX?
you do it
whom
someone send isaac randomizer to tyrone
if you unpacked it on location, it should be "\resources\packed\afterbirth_unpack\resources\gfx"
I unpacked it, but can't find it.
I know.
it's in the afterbirth.a
Do any of you guys know how to find the gfx folder for afterbirth?
guess we'll just uhh, take your word for it
oh cool
```Edmund McMillen ?@edmundmcmillen  6m6 minutes ago

I had issues with screenshots back when I uploaded too
yeah it's not my fault
<@!128874748041101312> probably not your fault but right now then I click the new screen thumbnails it gives me the old screenshots

all the original names are already there
why even let people suggest original names
bullshit!
hey guys did you know box has isaac written on it
shameful
probs not
are you going to fix that gamebreaking mom's box > box bug?
oh no
the character editor
it not allowing spacebar items in the item textbox thingy
which part?
lol ive had a rather important part of isaac character editor commented out and never uncommented it
you just need to write in rust
not really
easier said than done
>don't be a shit coder
^
easier said than done
tru dat
or don't be a shit coder and make a progress bar
<@!128874748041101312> maybe put a warning near the top of the page that it will freeze while it works, for potentially a couple minutes the first time
¯\_(?)_/¯
why didn't you tell me earlier
oh, that makes sense
<@!128874748041101312> i know its iran. im just generally anti ireland ;D *(mumble under breath) hope he buys this.*
ireland's green and orange
that's iran
fuck ireland.
it's actually ??
but why wouldn't it be, really
it changes
<@!128874748041101312> why is the randomizer logo an italian flag ?

actually I had an algorithm for that but I think I lost it
same way as names?
how do I randomize card descriptions

RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
you're dead
dammit I spawned in 4 chan
oh
oh the boss was named ur because my isaac is named ur
so they must know who noodle is
actually my least favorite starter
they have the discord baby
oh you think so? I heard that you like them
bad old dead meme
well considering that the current one is the binding of mudkip, we shouldn't have very stiff competition
dunno
I think it's tomorrow actually
that was in the binding of the modding of isaac
on what day do the features switch over anyway?
I guess he can't suggest IR to the rest of the team

same
everyone knows who noodle is
you're an inside joke
it's not an inside joke
it doesn't even have seal of approval
because its an inside joke mod
isnt binding of modding technically against the rules
OK but i'm still waiting on binding of modding to be featured
is he not still a webmod?
godmode is gonna be featured cause its underrated
jerb has no power anymore
he can't do it
but
jerb said it will
if it's not the next one I'm going to tear this whole world apart
featured mod
??
when isaac randomizer feature
??
I hope nobody neglects to download because they're scared of iran
they didn't
if they commented in isek then it's an inside job
im commenting for the coin. but the mod looks good anyway
tacoman commented on spooking
remember the old days where you used to get a fuck ton of coins upvoting posts
I've seen that name before
hmm tacoman
it takes time to randomize
who is this person

hutts
what
winter aradia post challenge
the most virusy thing it does is delete your installed isaac mods if you tell it to
lol
implying open source prevents "virus!!!!"
probably wouldn't stop them either way tbh
shoot those people with a gun
but people might be like virus!!!!
make it adware
yeah you probs shouldnt
you shouldn't, it would haunt you for the rest of your life
good on you
I don't want to make it open source
also make sure that i get credit for every new word added
wrote reply on reddit
it MUST be in patch 2
patch 1 is already out
how do you git? no idea
it MUST be in patch 1

fuck i still need to work on that
that's the only thing i care about tbh
then again isaac character editor isnt the prettiest thing either
the entire thing would give me an aneurysm
it works
see?
i already hate pajeet from the snippets of the code ive seen so far
never make it open source, everyone will hate us
god
thanks
yes so i can shitpost more commits
should I open source
honestly having my name on it is nothing but bad publicity
yeah sure, say that
"made by the greatest minds of the modding community"
no, ironically ask them to ironically download it
unironically ask them to download isaac character editor
oh yes
and isaac character editor
triple trouble
he played it several times
and the guy who made isek
actually, unironically mention that the guy who made Spooking is one of the people that made it
ill upvote ?
ah nice
there we go

but I'll send it forward anyway
and he hasn't played isaac in like 2 years
ah
he despises requests
why not
I'm only responsible for mike and vinesauce who probably won't play it anyway
can tear of grace play this xDDD
i'll post it on hutt's subreddit

and now it's taking a screen shot every button press
i did something on steam
oh god
impressive
isaac character editor started at 2.5
o wait nvm
atleast used to be
i think when you upload a mod its always 1.0
on top of that you titled the release 1.0 smh off
no but for real the page should prominently mention that it's still in development so more people subscribe and expect and are aware of the future updates
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1exwIYZQr_EUOY6PZsWYdmVxOjieOChbWIGCIBy-HhuQ/

yeah
did you guys figure out the flag logo meme already
add it
ok
yeah that's easy
so the game is back to normal
<@153966307593814016> planned

can you randomize mods with the randomizer
you dont want to deal with those comments
that's nicalis talk pajeet
wait
people will have no way to figure out how to uninstall this shit
i'm too lazy to add useful features ughhh
but it takes so long
you REALLY SHOULD ADD IT
i want to pick up a dildo
and randomize door frames
<@162156525337575425>  I was going to add a clear options feature but I was too lazy
custom item sprites
good idea winter
when will u randomize map icons
why would anyone ever want to go back
cause i dont think there is on
tbh i just realized something, you PROBABLY shouldve had a "delete randomizations" feature in the program
<@162156525337575425> okay I did

have a bunch of `if (afterbirthEnabled)` like i had ;^)
remove it :^)))))))))
cause every 5 lines of code there's something that isn't rebirth compatible
you'll have to add ? support so may aswell do rebirth too
how?
cuck
<@162156525337575425> actually would be really difficult tbh
add rebirth support
yeah seriously
it's worth it
honestly how hard would it be to add rebirth support pajeet
for isaac randomizer
too much effort tbh
pirate it
i'm sad that it's ab only tbh

go do it then ?
then we upvote brigade your reddit post
I forgot what that was
oh right
google forms seriously
I have no idea
no but for real tho
wew
use surveymonkey
google forms makes too much sense
google forum
it's good but i can't use it :^(
how should they suggest boss names
?
but hey you fucking outdid yourself pajeet
that was an ab port from trolling of isaac
trolling of isaac aftertroll
I just realised like none of my mods are original
also idk some google forms shit
probably the best thing to come out of the site since ever
tbh it only got a seal because i worked on it
it's honestly one of the most original mods on the site
second only to isaac character editor
2nd mod with most effort put into it
<@162156525337575425> what do you mean by a poll
tbh its well worth a seal
http://i.imgur.com/98J2pGG.png
sealed
is that a record for seal of approval
and if they're funny you'll add to program
have some user poll where they can add their own custom names for shit
sealed
you know what you should make in the reddit post
bit fucking different than i imagined
so this is what the gall blader looks like

tbh i was gonna improve it but eh
rewrite in rust
hay pajeet i know how to fix the font rendering
pajeet is better coder than you
isaac character editors looks even worse lol
<@!66197463593136128> that's cause I'm shit at making fonts
you might want to add a different font scaling in a later update
k
guess I'm leaving it
im not going to bother running the new build now pajeet take it or leave it

so now appa has learned how to hack accounts

"cant wait for ab+ to be out so i can make it more advenced!"
10 minutes
in like
although you could make the same thing in game maker
he  retweeted this which looks decent https://twitter.com/Britt_t_Brady/status/804947515237810176
"i made a binding of isaac randomizer"
"I made ab+"
just be like
blocked
I wonder what would happen if I tweet pics of isaac randomizer to him
what are you, appa?
i may not make it out
let's go on tyrone's twitter
well i'm bored
not paid enough for this shit
could test it further but eeeeeh
ok the release build didnt crash after randomizing
BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT USING OUR **MODDING API**
OH IT'S NOT A THING BY DEFAULT
yes
i know
you can change that
yeah almost every fucking item gives you hearts
this is pretty much a more stable corrupter if you shuffle sounds and music
wew
i picked up 1 item and maxed my hearts
They enjoyed the corrupter a bit
http://i.imgur.com/tH8EHik.png
wow
and you get downloads
they'd probably enjoy it a fair bit
do that
^
make a post on /r/bindingofisaac about it
you should probably like
definitely
and it progably goes without saying it'll get featured mod too
just fucking kidding i never want to see a "port to mac" comment ever again

one room recharge
it's toxic shock but it's also a bird that flies around (like dead bird but with good AI) and oneshots enemies
why not ? ? tbh
yes
toxic bird
it's an ab+ item
nice bird

something's not right

"oh and blow you i'll do that too"
they went up to ed and said "ill rewrite isaac in c++ for 10 dollars"
100 trading cards
what about 10 trading cards
no that's nicalis
<@!128874748041101312> ill rewrite randomizer in c++ for 10 dollars
?
oh yeah fixed music and character and boss name randomization is also in the release build
same
kill me
i've had to use this before
rewrite in http://www.touchdevelop.com
not rust smh
it is because pajeet sucks
so people can illegally download your free program
yeah
oh wait
I assume C#/.NET
i'm going to put isaac randomizer on pirate bay
what's the randomizer written in
he will have a more updated version ?
ye
fuck I forgot to give jerb the files
rewrite in spiral
hell no
rewrite in mac
rewrite in brainfuck
rewrite in fortran
rewrite in rust
and the shop friend
I'll use the crag
yeah like character sprite randomization, costume randomization and a few other shit
say no
and you just
getting screenies for you
i spent all this time
wow
are you implying there are some additional features in the release version

3 more
<@!128874748041101312>

ok let me finish this
someone get me screenshots
yes
should I release it
petition to wake limt up
**LIMT WAKE THE FUCK UP**
limt wake up
limt wake up
I'm not doing anything and I blame limt
download Notepad
download isaac character editor
download lilly
download binding of quote
download hellbound
<@145740433165647873> wake up so pajeet can release so we can spam comments with "download xyz" meme
<@145740433165647873> wake up
tell limt to wake up
release so we can spam the comments with "download xyz" meme
I added 40 more adjectives
ye
no??
"add me to special, thanks"
i always thought that meme was like
ye
jerb do you want it
I'd probably send him it anyway
you already are
^
i sent him a .zip file that contained isaac character editor
so was that
add me to special thanks
it's ok
pls it was a meme
<@162156525337575425> removed from special thanks
download isaac character editor
but i sent you it ?
well like i said i haven't seen the randomizer yet
because it uses the index of the word to determine if it's allowed or not
u can just edit the txt cant u
probs
they're just text files so
no
hey, pajeet, I haven't seen the randomizer yet so I don't know if it allows for it, but does it allow for putting custom user-added words in to the randomizer pool?
like from "telepathy for dummies"
what
as an item generation thing
as a preset?
yes
add "for dummies" to the randomizer
is moist an adjective on the randomizer yet
oh
like butter bean
yeah
butter? what
idk
butter
mega
oh
no I mean ones from the game
piss-stained
we need more original adjectives
i'd like to know what i pick up sometimes
make pause menu icons optional tho
I made the icons in the pause menu not show up until I find out how to make them the same as the item itself
that too
yes
inside me
after limt comes
release when
ah you took my idea good ?
also you get this once it finishes randomizing
different method
what'd you use for it
<@162156525337575425> music is now not shittily randomized
<@145740433165647873> wake the fuck up and give pajeet his screenshots
tell limt to wake the fuck up and give me his screenshots
I think that goes without saying
add seal to isaac randomizer

Don't know what's up with it
This happened once before too
Not me apparently
Who's going to ping everyone now?
IDK
<@!66197463593136128> You were kicked off the moderation team?
o I'm purple again
Oh, that's something Nicalis would do.
I'm pretty sure Skinless Hush was not scrapped, but instead is a red herring Nicalis threw in for the lulz
Just like skinless Hush
Maybe it was scrapped at the last minute.
I don't remember anything like that
<@196449185044627468> maybe when it dies?

Why are there broken versions of hush's veins?
bundled together since it was all part of the same package
I suppose that makes some sense
The blue womb has its entrance in its own files, rather than for the reg. womb
Odd
I'm pretty sure it would use the chapter's tileset
Would that use the blue womb stuff, or basement since its chapter I
Wait, what if I used a room from the blue womb stb as the renovator's starting room
if you wanted to make visually testing easier, you could switch the womb backdrop files with the basement ones
Yeah
And have them pulse when it charges its spit
Also I doubt that those sprites are placeholder. It's Nicalis, dude.
Ooh
Maybe replace the legs with Hush's veins latching on the wall instead of just removing them?
?
Then again, those might be placeholders
I think the sprite might need something else, though...
Yeah, kinda dissapointed when I saw those remotes
already better than ab+ sprites
nice work
killer
Huzzah
<@216324079504982016> drop me transcendence now plz
saved it as pdn rather than png
If they are invisible, it is due to an improper sprite in the anm2 file, or an improper anm2 path.
progress! maybe.
And now they're invisible
Yeah, that's exactly it
yeah
that might be because of the anm2 path
That probably means I screwed up with the animation path
But have normal creep sprites
They act like blind creeps
So, this is interesting
lame
But that's only a minor inconvienence
Nope, still crashes the editor
could be maybe
Not just normal
You know what would make The Poop a much more interesting item? If it could spawn any type of poop
the order shouldn't matter
Well, I just wasn't sure where in the entity data to put it, but I think I got it now
you can add an entry for variant or subtype to any enemy
you can simply add subtype="1" in among the other values
I'll try pulling it from another entity
But I don't know how to specify subtype in the entities2 file
if that doesn't work you might want to try adding an entry to the renovator resources
Maybe you're supposed to change that other number instead of the variant. I think that's subtype
if it's not in that subreddit page though I probably don't know the answer
I've had unsupported IDs which didn't crash it before
Which is odd, because they are specifically a variant of the blind creep
hmm, weird
<@145740433165647873> They became regular wall creeps when I started the game
A good sign of things to come (they crash the editor when you click them)
most of the placeholders actually run
odd detail
And the black markets are specifically 'racist placeholders'
it's generally a mess
Can't help but notice there's a lot of placeholder rooms in the special rooms bundle
sort of a pain in the ass
there are a couple things missing actually
I can't find ???'s Only Friend on the item list for renovator
~~NERD ALERT~~
deeper than the basement seed
must be part of the deep lore
But why ashes, though. hush literally has no connection to fire or bombs
the truth shines free at last
I thought that was supposed to be a bruise
Oh, right
probably the ash sprite hush leaves behind when you murder him
oh
no clue
What's "Hush Ashes"?
Of, course, the crap teleport
this might help if you haven't seen it
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/36o00t/entitys_explained_how_to_add_entity_variants/
Alright, I'll try it
yes that should do it
?
Then just use a spawn line in the room file with that variant value
I heard of that being done but never did it myself
Yeah, figured as much
and the animation path
Okay
I think you could just copy a whole enemy entry and change the variant value
Yes
are you generally familiar with xml?
I just need to know how I would go about adding it to entities2.xml
haven't tried it, myself
looking at the loose files for renovator though, I think you might be able to properly add it into the entities
I have a spritesheet ready with the animations set to it
but it wouldn't have a sprite of course
at least I think
you could manually edit it in and then copy and paste it yeah
Couldn't I just convert the stage to .xml, spawn an entity through that, convert it back to .stb, then pop it into renovator
actually, looking at the files maybe not
am I wrong folks!?
I believe you would have to modify and recompile renovator to do that
Could you guys help me out a bit? I'm trying to figure out how to create a variant of an existing enemy and place it in a room with basement renovator
carrot
<@!128874748041101312> listen to the carrot enthusiast
I can't convince pajeet that it's the rng which is broken instead of, for instance, his code to select a random name from a large index
you'd get a better randomizer by using a broken roulette wheel
ree
net
yeah lmao just use random.next
while it got no 40s or 80s
in 10000 iterations from 0-500, it got on average 35 0s and 35 500s
you could probably do `extern int rand` it'd work better
is the funny thing
it is
`Random.Next` is probably unironically better than pm2ks shit
i literally copypasated it from teh internet
<@!173420370773147649> your random number generator sucks

dont know why i made this but whatever lol
pin but it breaks like larry jr when u hit it
but a common enemy
i meant like pin
~~kill me~~
Except this is hush, so the *skin's* the limit
the sky's the limit
I could make a ringworm-esque hush version
Ohhh wait
Drowned chargers?
make a hush worm
could do
Wouldn't sister vis essentially fill the role of an ultra gluttony
Kinda like a labirynth floor
neat idea
In addition, I'll look at changing Sheol so that it has its own bosses (like sister vis). Satan fight will occur as a fake devil deal after you fight the first boss
Oh, you know it
will it still take several months to kill hush?
Still have two item rooms + shop
sounds good to me
The new blue womb will be randomly laid out, but much smaller than a normal floor
I already have a spritesheet for the hush creep, but need some help adding it as a variant of the blind creep
make blue womb okay for once
make blue womb great again
yeah do it!
enemies i'll add to an expanded version of the blue womb in ab+

nope, no eater eaters
as much as I personally support it, we don't want pussy streamers to shy away from it because the safe word mode has nsfw words

who needs ab+ when you can have ?

assuming somebody gifts it to me or some shit otherwise i wont even buy it in the first place
?
not buy ab+
uninstall it ?
what is the first thing you guys will do with ab+ ? (except add more poopvariants)
damned typos

who would want to talk to a bunch of gay nerds
i dont think they want to talk to us
Usually it's easy for us to contact people, but trying to talk to Ed or Tyrone is like trying to talk to a brick wall.
tyrone would never let him
do you think tyrone lets him
do u think edmund pays them any attention

Yes, but they don't care at all.
but IPECAC community modpack constantly tweets @edmund

yeah I don't mean this is the first time, I just meant in contrast
it's just a suggestion

hm
pretty sure there's only one trinket that changes your appearance, and that's the tick
don't handle them at all
actually
make sure you handle trinkets separately
yeah it would
would that work
remove a random id from that list and set it as that costume's id
and for each costume
so basically have a list of ids ranging from 1 to the total number of items
if you want to make things even more interesting, you could introduce ids that normally don't have a costume in there
because not all items have an associated costume
there are less costumes than items
oh also
like for backdrops
that or you could just scramble the ids themselves
basically you swap them all around except the id
you can start swapping them around
then starting from sad onion
I mean which option should change them
you'll recognize them, they're all grouped up on top
leave the first ones alone
so basically
costumes2.xml
costumes
sprites
should that be in players or items
otherwise it's too easy to tell what item you got
yeah
scramble them around
swapping
could probably do the thing
no no
the hue at least
have
<@!128874748041101312>  you should randomize item costumes too
but that does remind me. how do i get a hat onto isaac.
no wait found it
so i have an issue. had a snafu with something i was trying to get working, fixed it, and now i notice my map is all fucked up. where are the map files at.
it is
was that in yet?
though I recall thinking that the coin multiplier didn't
yeah they worked
player pickups worked iirc
great
jus tested agian
seems like it works
t
can zrememner
like what you start with
player pickups
but no
oh fuck I forgot about player health
certainly looked like that worked
you mean the black hearts n shit
<@153966307593814016> <@173420370773147649> <@162156525337575425> did any of you check if randomizing pickups worked
^
I won't know what my priorities are until I learn exactly what the api can do
maybe worth doing though
mm hmm
it would still be better if someone went to the trouble of at least looking through them all and touching them up though
theoretically a converter would convert all the old entities into a series of special entity IDs to stand in for enemy type flags
so it would probably work
yep
we can already edit rooms though, just not in real time
^^
you need to edit the rooms as well
however if the api can simply spawn an entity, then someone could potentially make a program to conver the old stages into a sort of less handcrafted version and then use a mod to fill in the spawns in real time
with lua alone it would be impossible
the api is probably awful because nicalis but i dontknow lua so
yeah I was talking about features I think they should have had originally, internally
would make a cool mod for afterbirth plus
but there's no way the "api" is going to be good enough
good idea
more variety when you play and also less need to make new rooms for new enemies
like put a bunch of spawn points, these are flying enemies, these are stationary enemies, and the game fills in a certain number of those spawns with appropriate enemies based on the chapter or something
would make more sense if they just placed enemy archetypes instead of specific enemies in every single room anyway
>edmund doing anything for afterbirth
when he could be using renovator?
hey do you think edmund is making the new rooms with their internal editor?
oh woah wait
Did Edmund do the rooms for Afterbirth?
already existing rooms counted*
1000 new rooms!!
lol yeah I expect them to
not just empty but recolored
inb4 they announce the fact that there's 1000+ new rooms as a "feature" like they did with ab
less than a month before release though??
plot twist
and they're all empty
bless his heart he's doing work
```Edmund McMillen ?@edmundmcmillen  1h1 hour ago
200 rooms made for ab+... 800+ to go!```
yea

The character effects should be swapped as well
nah not really, it's pretty easy
oh well that doesn't sound like a big deal either
you'll have to take it apart and reassemble it
huh no the pause menu icons are all in a single sheet
true
rip 8:53
added it to the doc
just changing the names of those icons should work at a minimum, yes?
i remember pm2k tried it at some point
do you guys know how to do it?
fuck yes
perfect
yes
so people have no idea what they picked up
pajeet should we be cunts and include swapping the item icons in the pause menu before release
hmm
incredible

its shit video, i assume the volume is gonna be quiet and the top of the window is at the top of the screen the whole vid
lookin forward to it!

I think it would be worth having the frames not match well, and it would always be optional
added to the google doc in purple
the only problems i can see is brimstone baby and inccubus because they have lots of frames
would be a nice touch
yes
very low priority but actually swapping familiars and replacing them with babies would not be difficult
pls
<@!128874748041101312> randomize familliar sprites tbh
maybe the baby got shotgunned
like kurt cobain

there's posters in box

it's just rotated 90 degrees
fair enough
it's d10

the buggy shit that doesn't do anything
no item type randomization option upon release
what
okay <@!128874748041101312> nvm fuck the item types thing
Knowing nicalis
That could actually be a AB+ sprite

so much ab+

forgot about that
ohhh you got the endless pennies because of the charge time
because 90% of items didnt work
i turned that off for now
yeah
will hopefully be ready for the weekend
the release, maybe we'll call it the beta
Nice
<@89855974113824768> it's like 85% complete
we mean item types, which makes items active or passive when they shouldn't be, and shit like that
dude A is too strong
is that a in progress mod?
it's daddy long legs
i turned that off for now
woah..
http://i.imgur.com/QRPUezS.png

I can't imagine what that would ever be

not to imply that you're a hog

but hey, both options are there for a reason
because they're often more ridiculous when you know what they're talking about
true randomization
when i can have
yes but why would i want consisten randomization
what a lark
and using it gives me coin eyes for a room
i have keeper's head as an active

they're gone in a flash
you sure thats ball of tar
i didnt read it in time
ball of tar said "you feel unworthy" i think
make it in c# so i can copy paste
counterfeit penny is the same too
maybe pajeet or I will make a simple version of my isaac enemy/object randomizer in a version or maybe at some point I'll just make an isaac stage generator
never changes
doesnt do trinkets iirc

I have an algorithm for actual hue shifting but it's not in use yet
good
so he changed it
download isaac character editor
no shit it sucked, pm2k made it
I think he switched to grayscale and converted to one hue
yes
the old method SUCKED
unless he changed my stuff
I think
hes using color matrix i think
it's colorizing now
plain old multiplication, hue shifting or colorizing
<@66197463593136128> are you enjoying the editor ?
I just want enemies randomized lmao
right now he's using sort of a lazy method of recoloring but there's a better one we could switch to at some point maybe
could also randomly choose between different recoloring method
Come on, it's not like Afterbirth is consistent anyways
could always be an option tho
it was on the table at a point, still could be
i think he colors them both for consistency?
that's actually pretty easy to do
^
if you recolored the walls and the floors separately
you know what would make this even better

you know what it's from

dammit why the hell does steam not prompt me with the screenshots I took when I close the game half the time
no I patched spooking for code bugs 3-4 times though
the only reason i didnt include trinket name randomization in the shitcode i gave swift was because i was too lazy to just add another node iteration thingy for them iirc
yeah prob
NO MEMES
if you were responsible the code wouldve worked perfectly
i feel like an opportunity was missed to call it No Man's Skisaac
whew, glad I'm not responsible for the code today

you have to copy it over manually
I should probably fix that

how many years approx should i wait for the randomizing to end
thanks nicalis
wew
lol
oh epic i didnt even randomize anything and isaac crashes
or some shit
...just like embed the font in the executable
upheaval makes me heave
and yeah that
it's cause you don't have upheaval
release will have a banner that doesn't look like complete garbage
ugh
why keep the ugly dice thingy
before next release please fucking center this properly http://i.imgur.com/iyDJCmP.png
also isaac rarities option is still here despite being poppycock

time to install isaac i guess...
ye ok
someone will have to make their own randomizer randomizer mod for the randomizer to do that
do it pajeet
randomize the randomizer
there will be presets
1 sec
I'll make a preset for it
yo <@!128874748041101312> is there just a like... randomzie EVERYTHING button
here we go!!!!
<@153966307593814016> <@162156525337575425> <@173420370773147649> isaac randomizer test build has been shipped to you
moving to <#207235517236903937>
^
Most people have conversations in <#207259602969034753> because you can post images.
?
started 20 min timer
mainly it's useful that multiple different conversations can happen at once on the server but I don't think that offtopic posting tends to cause many problems
ill update rb after my post in 20 min
i adult
yeah I know
i kid
would make moderation a nightmare though
darn
almost
yes
yes
i should just get rid of all channels and keep general
half of this convo is <#206619494712475649> anyways
^
noodle ban
o
noodle you did bad job
why isn't this is <#207235517236903937>
` general too?`
!poll general too?
WAIT
yes
hmm
yeah and general too?
probably a good idea to restrict those to basement tbh
?
wellp he deleted all his comments
can we please have those commands only work in <#207259602969034753>
and we also get those posts out of it
that I showed u?
noodle remember your fan I talked with a few weeks ago?
lol
yeah
THIS IS AN ANGRY POST I REALLY WANT MODS FROM THIS SITE BUT I WHAVE TO OWN THE STEAM VERSION OF REBIRTH AND I HAVE THE NON STEAM ONE ALSO TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS OF THIS WONDERFUL GAME WTF WONDERFUL WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION ALOT OF US JUST WANT MODS BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE CAN'T DOWNLOAD THESE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO OWN REBIRTH WHAT THE HELL MAN I HAVE MADE ALOT OF MODS BUT THERE NOT IN THIS SITE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO OWN THE FUCKING OF IDIOTSAAC RESHITTED SO WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE PEOPLE MAKE US ABLE TO GET THE MODS WITHOUT THE GAME OR NOT DO THAT YOUR CHOICE YOU JUST WANT US TO SPEND MONEY
GET MODS WITHOUT OWNING THE GAME?
i mean that could be part of it, im not too concerned about it and i don't think nicalis is either, we mainly implemented that because you shouldn't have been able to make mods without owning the game
<@147076393937797121> and is this because the site redistributes game files mostly?
lol
<@145740433165647873>
you must own the game to post mods, yes
again, he has his own following of asskissers at this point
<@!182509747835109387> <#207259602969034753>
the shellcode will be funny enough ?
to people who only play isaac casually a few times a month i can see how an item that changes your character every six rooms would seem cool
wow!
wow!
Tyrone is very productive.
I'm starting to have the feeling that, as disappointing as I am sure to be at ab+, it might just be funny enough to make up for it
WOW!
man that person's easily amused
the ***GENIUSES*** at nicalis
<@159492166542950401> yes
wow pausing in a video game, what will they think of next!
dude that's not the question
<@147076393937797121> am I right on the money?
<@147076393937797121> does TMOI require you to own isaac in order to make mdos?
Oh.
Noodle would know for sure
I'm not entirely sure, I would assume so.
this is true?
by the way, I've always assumed that MOI requires that you own the game because of the legal complications of redistributing game files
lol
lol
lol
oh fuck me
Not Rebirth.
That's WotL.
as an alternate platform
it says drm-free next to steam
https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-binding-of-isaac-wrath-of-the-lamb-dlc
Just gives you a Steam key.
It's not DRM-free.
also <@66197463593136128> there appears to be a drm-free version on the humble store, there is a link to it on their blog
anyway
I'll never believe it
pfffft no way
he could make a better api
But Clicker is a real item.
<@145740433165647873> unless <@167363485326508033> makes one
kek
"better sprites for upcoming example mods"
better than nicalis that's for sure
you should release that standalone as a mod on MOI
yep
Better than the official one
it is better
its better than a rectangle at least
not really all that happy with it but here was my basic attempt at a "clicker"
let's make a change.org petition
Convert them all.
keep going
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/5feny8/tyrone_not_again/dajowa2/ I have converted one of them.
<@!182509747835109387> I guess there's just never going to be a better api than this and it will be our only option and we'll have to live with this one and only this one
true
actually guys I just realized, they definitely won't delay ab+ and it will for sure be released in 2016 because only the year 2016 is a bad enough year for that to happen in
Please release a better API.
please make nicalis scramble patching shit
please do
DOWNLOAD ISAAC CHARACTER EDITOR
again, I can't wait to hack the fuck out of the API to do all kinds of crazy unintended shit
ISAAC CHARACTER EDITOR IS NOT OBSOLETE TAKE THAT YOU FUCKOS
Defeating half the purpose of an API?
they make a "shiny new" API that has the whole XML thing still?
so basically
So is it confirmed that we have to edit the XML's manually?
if we're correct
So, let me get this straight
?
i'm assuming then that item properties like description, gfx, maxcharges, and name will be static based on the xml which is pretty silly
<@145740433165647873> yeah they modded ab+ just now duh
no
honestly just use node.js
I wonder if any of them have ever modded anything
yeah use json instead smh
Ditch the XML!
For CRYING OUT LOUD
It's a basic feature!
yes also that
^
^
the inclusion of the item in an xml file shouldn't be necessary, that should be done by the api
it's stupid but I can live with it
yeah I don't really mind that much
its just in `modname/content/items.xml`
no
oh
jer seemed to imply that he was worried that the entries would all have to be on a single items.xml
oh
I think he means every mod will have a separate items.xml that is merged in on run.
wait what do you mean
no it's going to be xml, but I will not accept that they will all have to read from one file
basically
whose rng is so bad champions come in double
thats 100% how they've done this
So all we know is that we can apply effects from stuff to other stuff?
who put a sleep(1) in windowed
no other reason the xml would be there
these are the geniuses who backported rebirth bugs
I won't do it
nicalis
I refuse
it's nicalis, friend
I refuse to consider it
there's no way they're braindead enough to make it be the same single file
no way it does it automatically
that's pretty backwards
I mean you can't just make everyone be in charge of manually editing the same one file
<@!182509747835109387> I don't see that in the code
but why can't you just... I don't know... define all that in the API?
Maybe the API does it automatically.
well that would be *better*
not necessarily
well to a separate items.xml
probably
THIS IS A FUCKING MODDING API, NICALIS
maybe
Yes.
WE HAVE TO ADD THEM TO THE ITEMS.XML MANUALLY STILL
Yes, so we have to use xmls again.
yes jerry
??????
WE HAVE TO
yes
unironic
NO
DOES THAT MEAN
GOD NO
WAIT
oh NO
`<items gfxroot="gfx/items/" version="1">
    <active description="Burn In Hell!" gfx="Collectibles_Pyrokinesis.png" maxcharges="4" name="Pyrokinesis" />
</items>
`
<@145740433165647873> i'll bet there's already one on moddingofisaac
oh yeah and it also has an items.xml for some reason
aww yiss
if the source code is there, and they're implying it's free to use and modify does it mean those sick-ass graphics are free to use and modify?
let's make a mod with it really quick so we can get sued
thats literally it

wait the resources were released?
these are they
Yeah, just those two samples
besides resources, yeah
Yes.
so that zip file just has those two samples?
IT'S OUR LIFE
i dont have enough self hatred to review this shit any longer
The pointless else ifs are pretty funny though.
because that's pretty much where the conversation is headed
if we're just going to analyze the code we should move in to <#220581404612886528>
true
well, anyways
¯\_(?)_/¯
I don't understand if you are trying to make a point or what
i swear to fuck he made the exact same thing when he was first learning lmao
It is bad code I found.
is this pajeets code
dude what the hell are you doing
It is C#.
lol
that isn't lua, my friend
uh
^
Can that code compete with this code?
let alone the limits
I admit I wouldn't have guessed that we'd be <2 weeks from release, ostensibly, and barely have a clue what AESPECTS of the game can be modded at all
gay tardis
more like
that remote looks like a gray tardis
we know jack shit
we don't know if you can influence floor generation at all
not even camelcased smh
yeah
none too impressed with these hooks
https://www.reddit.com/r/badcode/
KEK
ok let's put this code on /r/roastme
Yay.
```lua
local    hothead = RegisterMod( "Hothead" );
local    pyrokinesis_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Pyrokinesis" )

function hothead:use_pyrokinesis( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( )
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
        end
    end
end

hothead:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );
```
Oh.
oh that too
add "lua" after the first 3 backticks
classified
```lua
local    hothead = RegisterMod( "Hothead" );
local    pyrokinesis_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Pyrokinesis" )
function hothead:use_pyrokinesis( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( )
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
        end
    end
end
hothead:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );```
How do you get the coloring?
nice
```
local    hothead = RegisterMod( "Hothead" );
local    pyrokinesis_item = Isaac.GetItemIdByName( "Pyrokinesis" )

function hothead:use_pyrokinesis( )
    local    player = Isaac.GetPlayer( )
    local    entities = Isaac.GetRoomEntities( )
    for i = 1, #entities do
        if entities[ i ]:IsVulnerableEnemy( ) then
            entities[ i ]:AddBurn( EntityRef( player ), 120, 1.0 )
        end
    end
end

hothead:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_USE_ITEM, hothead.use_pyrokinesis, pyrokinesis_item );
```
and the second mod
```lua
require("mobdebug").start()

-- Register mod
local PoopingMod = RegisterMod("PoopingMod");

-- Filtered callback for NPCUpdate
function PoopingMod:NPCUpdate( npc )
  -- Random poop attack
  if npc.State == NpcState.STATE_IDLE and math.random(5) == 1 then
    npc.State = NpcState.STATE_ATTACK2
  elseif npc.State == NpcState.STATE_ATTACK2 then
    -- Plant a poop each 5 frames
    if npc.StateFrame % 5 == 0 then
      local pos = Isaac.GetFreeNearPosition(npc.Position, 80.0)
      Isaac.GridSpawn(GridEntityType.GRID_POOP, 0, pos, false)
    end
    npc.StateFrame = npc.StateFrame + 1
    -- Back to idle, clear the StateFrame
    if npc.StateFrame > 30 then
      npc.State = NpcState.STATE_IDLE
      npc.StateFrame = 0
    end
  end
    
end

-- Register the callback
PoopingMod:AddCallback( ModCallbacks.MC_NPC_UPDATE, PoopingMod.NPCUpdate, EntityType.ENTITY_MONSTRO);
```
that was their reasoning
because "TUMBLR IS HITLER xDDDDD"
i downloaded the zip
It wasn't formatted in the blog post.
Thanks.

Well, at least the code is basic.
https://soundcloud.com/noodleboy347/remove-afterbirth
remove afterbirth+
it would look better if they remembered the game's own art style
They shouldn't have added the nub to the top. It would have looked better.
would be hilarious if someone released a mod that made them announce a last-minute delay to AB+
well yeah
its just a basic shape i mean
well its a remote
i'm saying it has the shape of a fucking battery
yeah, i'm not saying the battery sprite
nah the battery sprite is different
hohohoho
I'll be surprised if it isn't delayed.
we'll find out next week.
isaac doesn't deserve this
i can't help but hope ab+ will come out as late as possible
*hires ciirulean* oh he didn't work on ab+ that's why he isn't in the credits
lol
they might as well have used clip art
mmmmmmmmmm
I noticed that too, it's like they took a battery sprite as a base
lol
and fuck him over like sag?
should've hired you
that's like zero effort
or less
i could make a much better sprite in five minutes
Probably
we can only hope
maybe they made this sprite 5 minutes before posting
they can't even bother having their own artists work on this
It looks more like a battery than a remote.
ignore you? gotcha
not the good people, apparently
i'm shit at explaining things, ignore me
they just hired people from the community
a terrible sprite
do they even have a sprite artist working there now?
oh oh oh i know what it is
sure does
regardless, looks like shit
well yeah
those are supposed to be buttons, not shading
and that's why it looks off
no dither detected
it's more like the proportions are "realistic" compared to most other sprites
thats not dithering
looks like they used the same technique at least
they're not really dithered
http://i.imgur.com/78bv8RI.png
i dont see any dithering on those sprites
i know what dithering is
you can make gta V, you can put the game in VR, you can get your blood tested for disease
If you look at the buttons a very similar technique was applied to the buttons
<@129339380090404864> http://www.derekyu.com/images/extras/dither02.jpg these are dithering examples
it's lua modding, you can do anything now
They'll be like "LOOK AT ALL THIS CONTENT NICALIS PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO IT PLUS ENDLESS GAMEPLAY BECAUSE MODS WILL BE ADDED TO THE GAME"
40$ for a LITERALLY ENDLESS AMOUNT OF CONTENT
of course
the subreddit would still defend it
what do you mean theyre dithered
at least then we'd all get a laugh out of it
what would be cool is if ab+ cost like 40$
IPECAC made better sprites than that.
Those remote buttons are just dithered
Those sprites are really ugly, yeah
as in they're just boring
also both of those sprites are really ugly
almost all the extra life items suck
this is like, a step above
i was never too fond of extra life items that change your character
without actually achieving them
you get the item and you get 1 or more free notepad fills
Yep.
same
yeah
I think character changing is basically a stupid concept overall
Yes, Clicker seems useless. You play as a character because you want the achievements for that character.
in a manner similar to dice rooms
how would you implement character changing?
also its a lame reference as well
EXCEPT IT IS NOT STONE, IT'S PAUSE.
clicker seems kind of interesting but thats not how i would implement character changing at all
Yep!
lol did they forget about moms bra
Not impressed with those mods
Bad blog post.
it appears to actually be mentioning shit about modding
bad what?
Bad.
hmmmmmmmm......
http://bindingofisaac.com/
horrible
Kewel
hot
beaut
oh

I "modded" the Rebirth Krampus sprite
You can copy the files, or keep them in the packed folder. It won't mess up your game.
do i copy the original files and save them for later
is this a copy of the files already in the vanilla version?
ok.
<:isaac_surprised:245063314873253888>
app
i know how to unpack too btw you just drag the packed onto the unpacker
No.
the top 2
wait is it *giving* me ab files
probaably was gonna do that anyways :3
i'll just cling to help
oh ok
<@159492166542950401> Just change as little as possible because the more you change, the less likely it is to work.
Why though?
dope dude
or does it look for a specific app name
Probably
can i change the apps name?
pls
but tis' something so complicated looking i don't want to comfuse my self more than i have to
Yes, so don't delete them.
smol
biggest file is 196 Kilabytes
im deleting a lot of my steam games i dont play
¯\_(?)_/¯
idk
you have like 200gb space free why do you aant to delete anything
like fuck are you intentionally trying to break this lmao
seems to be useful
not really
^^^
Why do you want to delete all this stuff?
can i delet the revisons
you dont either finn, fuck off
Wow, what a loser.
no
but do you own ?
I wouldn't, but you can if you want.
as  i do not own AB
Why would you?

can i seperate the .dlls
It will still work, but you're not supposed to.
No, don't remove it.

Delete what license?
can i delete the license?
wew
? < looks like hes dancing on twitter emotes
yeah but those people are better off not using a computer anyway
i'm spooked ?
lol
it scared me at first
tbh that download page probably scared away a few people who had no idea what they're doing
which is the 20th?
The newest one
which verson?
so
And style is better than no style, but the download page for one mod doesn't have to be pretty.
MoI is different because it's a catalog of mods.
so moi doesnt have to be pretty either
It's a download page. It doesn't have to look pretty.
pls
lookish
why is it html ?
Yes.
is this it?

do you like troll bombs
Just do it yourself.
ok
I don't like Overwatch.
pls ?
PLEASE MAKE IT THE FACE
worst legendary skin in the game
overwatch
What is that?
bad skin
<@!182509747835109387>  pls make troll bombs this face
Filthy Frank is bad.
pls
No.
in place of
put this on the suicide king card
0 coins in themoi
Lol gay finn with no suns
I have zero.
<@159492166542950401> How many suns do you have?
?
Spank you for your suns
<@159492166542950401> bad
fix mysaelf
o
Why is this in <#205854782542315520>?
which mod is this?
Oh.
yes
without a mouse, yes, it's very difficult
are you fucking kidding me !?!?!
its just too hard
he realized he doesn't own a mouse
why ?
i give up
you know what screw it
nvm
how the hell do i edit a stb file
ok question
ok. then create a new room in special_rooms.stb. right click that and set the room type to "mini boss" and the id ( first input field) to a number between 2050 and 2059. then name that room "Envy". you now have the same result as when you just copy that shit and delete everything in it...
much more fun
i dunno i just want to make a room from scratch
and why cant you copy a room and just delete everything thats in it ? its way easier than making one from scratch
ok but i kinda wanna make a room from scratch is what i mean
you dont override a room since you copy an existing one and work on that copy. result is a new room
but i kinda dont want to overwrite rooms
ok. the easiet way to create an envy miniboss room is to open special_rooms.stb search for envy and copy a room. that copy can then be edited like you want to
moment
then?
rightclick the room entry
im trying to make an envy miniboss room
how do i set the room type
no like
?
double click the .exe file
so how do i use basement renovator
Just like the title
Yes
Very immersive

Thank you so much
http://moddingofisaac.com/help <@208297702792888320>
So I downloaded a mod, how do I integrate it into the game xD?
Say uhm
yep, I made a song 3 dB louder and now it's ok
thanks
ok
probably songs fault
this is isaac fault or maybe I should change something in songs?
I need help. I tried to change music in Isaac, but some songs are too quiet and some too loud
Oh, that means it sucks.
this is earthbound
this is it
philosophicalgamer1 year ago
Favorite Soundtrack from this game :D
Seriously, when I first heard it, I was like "this is it...this is Earthbound"
BUY LILLY OST
https://appa27.bandcamp.com/track/spinach-pie
?
repeat every tear shoot noise with isaac dying
isaac sound randomizer is best sound mod
why cant I post mod
so bad
it changes tempo like 3 fucking times
also santuary gaurdian is awful i really dont get its popularity
who wants a cool sound mod
appa pls tf2? :3
?
buzz buzz xd
bad bee
?
well it sounds bad without headphones too
it's supposed to b on your TV
you're not supposed to be listening to it with headphones
OW
high pitched beeping and a shitty ass like bassline
?
?
holy shit my ears
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDr-1Bk9QAA&index=15&list=PL74EE7E6C2A3439BD
onett day is okay
like the onnet night music is so fucking awful
when i first started playing i was so turned off by the music
every song is overrated
the porky battle theme is overrated
I like Smiles and Tears, but the rest is pretty bad.
ill never gert why people like it
earthbound has an awful ost
For some reason, Poke always uses EB music in the trailers.
could do without the shitty earthbound music
I'm more of a Sun person... Let's trade!!

we bully away all the apologists ?
ad noodle to afterbirth plus as playable character
this is going to happen and it's completely on topic
nicalis has a "modding API"
it's a modding server
well that's to be expected, yeah
I'm one of the biggest nicalis defenders on the server just because I say "I can imagine reasons why ab+ might potentially end up being okay"
Ye
its great
Tbh this is more shitting on nicalis server than moi server lol. But thats to be expected
I hate that guy that waits in my shower and hits me with a golf club when I try to use it like 3-4 times per year
^
I hate nicalis more
I hate the double post on Discord when you have terrible internet.
? ?
ahaHAHAHAHA
Will it add ? ?
good mod
Our boner cousins
Make a mod that removes AB and AB+, and adds ?.
Our boner cousibs
Its called the actual game
https://soundcloud.com/noodleboy347/remove-afterbirth
remove afterbirth+
Nicalis does it already bob
is called ab+
ye i have mod
make mod that crash game when it launchs
yup
that's what we all did
And then ab+ stream and lung just decided "lol fuck this shit"
Whoa, 1000 hearts! As I say, I never thought Heretic would go so far! We are already making concepts for when Afterbirth+ comes out, so here's a lil teaser:
?
We actually had some cool shit planned
~~leak heretic+ when~~
?
<@145740433165647873> ?
Yes, but Nicalis is too lazy.
And im sad now ? i need a ? to cheer up
HERETIC+ mod w h e n
Dammit jer you're making me remember the heretic+ idea doc for a ded game
make a multiplayer arena
That sounds interesting.
But yeah, like kil said, that would be hell to code
rare cathedral enemy, a "mimic" of sorts
ikr the AI would be SOO COMPLEX
i guess not all items would be replicated
that'd be really complicated to code though
I had an idea for that actually
make a boss that fights you with your own items
I had a brainfart
but make it still manageable with a worse build
Well, hp scaling
Dmg scaling wouldve been so much better
balance the boss around a relatively strong build
true
i just shoot in his general direction
rather than the other way around
honestly with ultra greed i never have an idea of whats going on the screen
imo damage reduction should be used to make the boss easier with a bad build
yes, *they* should
Hush is also tanky tho
They should make a damage reducing boss that isn't tanky.
Ultra greed takes too long sometimes but is fun imo
^^^^
yeah
actually, "good idea, meh execution" sums up most of AB pretty well
fuck hush
i can feel my skin cells aging while fighting hush
He's LITERALLY a waste of time with the whole damage shield thing
good idea, meh execution
^
but he's actually really monotonous
too much hp, not enough challange
hush feels like a waste of fucking time
He's fun the first few times
^
Just annoying.
But Hush isn't really that fun.
And people complained about it.
Pure mindless ***FUN!***
but that's just one boss
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1316/extremely-overpowered-start-afterbirth best mod 8/8
i suppose hush was an attempt to make even the most overpowered runs somewhat challenging
because they just ruin the run for me
like epic fetus
But having nothing that puts up an enjoyable fight is horrid
i often have to actively avoid certain items
not when it's possible all the time
Because becomibg so powerful is fun
Its the fun and the unfun
it's the fundamental nature of isaac that's fucked up
if you make sure they all synergize perfectly you'll always have something powerful
you have a lot of items
that's the problem with synergies
tru
and it wasn't always easy to exploit it
except the d20 wasn't too common
isaac synergy editor
I don't agree all synergies should be removed, but some of them are too OP.
that was already a problem in rebirth, and even in wotl, with the d20
kilburn synergy remover when
someone should make a mod that removes all synergies ;)
there are so many items and synergies that give you infinite resources
and it's not the only one
And the synergy with Restock.
without thinking of the implications
how could they have possibly done that
an example of god awful game design is the double steam sale synergy
Wow, they tried to make an auto-win character worse. Now it's not fun.
OMG NICALIS REMOVED ***FUN***
which is why I massively mitigated OP synergies in my mod
and they're not aware it spoils the experience for them
oh god dont even try to balance the game
the problem is that players want instant gratification
Also, people complain when the game is balanced. Remember the Azazel nerf?
any time I get anything interesting going in game, it because way too easy
broken synergies are one of the things that has made isaac the least enjoyable for me
it takes the fun away from the game
if every run is an OP run
it's one of the problems edmund mentioned a while back
cause thats what isaac playerbase in 2016 wants
TRUUUUUU
as long as it makes le OP broken synergy runs xD
anything goes
but now, they basically stopped caring
WotL was great balance wise
there used to be some balance in whatever was thrown in the blender
and there are simply enough tasks that you have have to get decent at the game to complete them all rather than relying on flukes
it's shitty shit
well then you know something's bad when you're calling the shit... shit
it's just a bunch of shit thrown into a blender and the fun has mostly been in seeing what you get
and watch spongebob
Yo, we need money for Tyrone to take another fucking vacation to Japan.
isaac never had much at all in the way of traditional game design
but nicalis is like "yo we need money"
Yes, exactly.
that would be the best thing to do
and that's not okay
if edmund had his way mod support would be a separate free update for afterbirth
many of the items were drawn by people hired from the community
there's a huge money motivation going for ab+ right now
I still can't believe Pokego is a fucking item.
it already started in afterbirth and probably even before
now here's the thing
is another completely different thing
relying on them to make content for you
yeah but the modding UI is mostly irrelevant
listening to your community is one thing
rather than depending on the community
The modding UI looks so shitty.
it would be nice if they actually acted more confident about their ability to do game design
fuck they're going the opposite way and fucking it up even more
(they're not)
and were willing to fix it
i suppose i could have been excited about ab+ if they were more aware of what they fucked up in AB
afterbirth had so much wasted potential
because they've done enough damage with AB
yall are just memeing then
they debatedly should have left rebirth alone too
at this point i'd say "if it didn't exist at all"
The only thing I like so far about AB+ is Flux.
^
just leave isaac alone
hypothetically, what would it take for AB+ to satisfy you all?
it should have ended at afterbirth tbh
nice joke
ab+
Me neither. Ed hasn't shown much good stuff.
can't say i'm very excited about it
And you know it won't be released in 2016.
But they'll be super popular before AB+ comes out.
and they'll probably be irrelevant once ab+ is out
haven't touched them in a while though
i guess i could do that
Just release your mods before AB+ comes out.
cant wait to be forced to play godmode
how can we trust them to do quality control on other people's content?
if nicalis can't even do quality control on their own content
i'm really not a big fan of integrating mods into the game
<:NiceMeme:216631542166978560>
>calling someone salty
Who needs emotes?
I have more emotes than I could ever want
You're just salty because you don't have emotes.
make it cost 1 item per emote

<@167363485326508033> Release one of your mods.
I helped him work on it a tidbit back in the day
anybody know if the basement renovator guy is still around?
kilburn did u mod the game again
same
CROWN OF BLOOD
this guy knows what's up
No, looks too good to be AB+.
ye
is that ab+
ah, nice steamy ravioli
https://vinh.penisoft.com/LQVuxjx3mN.png
yep
just sneak it into another mod
nice idea
?
aw
That's easy, but no one will download it.
<:troll_bomb:230143860813201408>

kthx

yeas thanks
woops
you already ~~hacked nicalis~~ stole the stone fatty sprite
i could probably just replicate them myself
you've got a point
actually
you've seen them
why would you want the sprites and animations
wait hold on
i would pirate it tbh its not worth money dfor a dlc for a half assed dlc
the only reason i'd get ab+ would be maybe for the sprites and animations
I'll probably get it to help with IPECAC.
https://youtu.be/UwUPO023aPc
nice meme
ab+? buy?
i already regretted purchasing AB
pffrtt
<@167363485326508033> Are you going to buy AB+?
?
what for?
what for
Oh, you're pirating it?
...if you catch my drift there
I'm not buying AB+
because frankly
and spit out a file you can use
they download from Steam Workshop
Yeah
Steam Workshop grabber?
all the mods are going to be "BUFFED CHARACTER LEL"
then again
Either way, I'm sticking with moddingofisaac.com, and if there's a mod on the workshop I really want, I'll use one of those steam workshop grabbers.
Either way, it is likely that they would do it without permission.
They're either going to do workshop or their own site.
Once a month, BAM, official mod merge!
But if they made a website, it would probably say in the terms of service that they could do that.
They said they'd do it.
And it is something Nicalis would do.
Oh, that sucks.
is it means that nicalis can merge your mod in officially without permission
<@!182509747835109387> the problem with steam workshop
Not enough carrots
fantastic mod, amazing
bad mod
try spooking of isaac
make a mod that makes isaac fun
both features are just a huge pain in the ass imo
or both
probably a mod to either make curses fun or to make pills fun
I'll make test mods first though just to get used to it
and to make it so that incidental gamebreaking doesn't totally trivialize the challenge
the main point of my game mode will be to make the game stop being so tedious now that I'm used to it
I'm probably not going to make my own mod right away because I'll be working on IPECAC.
someone give me AB files please even though limt said to not give it to me ?
monstro III is the final boss
monstro III
no that would be way too hard to make
then
monstro II
then
monstro
where u fight
are u making monstro mode
my game mode, if that's able to be made, will at least require a new final boss, and I'm not sure I can do justice to an original boss-sized sprite
i'm going to make a mod that turns tboi into a 1:1 replica of undertale
NO
Just use the pacifist seed.
pacifist runs enabled
monstro and a trap door and you can go down the trap door as soon as monstro moves off it rather than killing him
my mod is press space to win. enjoy.
a trap door
just
double monstro
no monstro
howsabout
too easy limt
nice
mm
"adds noodle as playable isaac"
my mod simplifies isaac by reducing each run to a single isaac/monstro boss fight
"hello what is this mod"
When ? comes out, I'm going to make an actually good mod.
? tbh
and that's the only thing i will type on the page
"adds noodle as playable isaac"
It's more convenient to download mods.
titled
i'm going to put binding of modding on workshop
I would rather have Steam Workshop than a separate website.
cant wait for all the +1000 damage item mods
I just want to find the gems among the feces
yeah exactly
lol steam workshop is a breeding ground for shit
if TMOI has better curation than a hypothetical steam workshop, then that alone would make me stick to it
oh of course
you mean ?
Well considering TMOI may stay alive as an underground site just to avoid Nicalis bullshit, that might not be too bad of a suggestion once AB+ comes out
yes, precisely
Is this so that Spook will be featured every week?
it would be nice if maybe the TMOI site started featuring 2 or 3 mods per week in different categories, one specifically for large substantial gameplay mods
Hopefully, they can see quality over what's popular.
I'll admit I'm worried about the few actually cool significant mods being lost within a sea of memes
I'm looking forward to them
Yes, best mod
"hey look at this super cool item i made!!!! +1000 damage XD but dont press space it crashes the game"
there's going to be even worse broken and buggy mods when ab+ comes out
Please no.
give people one last good chance to flood shitpost meme character mods before ab+
ok
feature isaac character editor please
no
if you're corrupt can I bribe you to feature my mod
?
in fact, more of a mod than the character editor is right now, technically
there, still a mod
somewhere among the doges include a doge which replaces some sprite
have a nice day ?
because I'm corrupt
but I won't
well then i would have to delete the mod
readme instructions: rename doge.jpg to doge.zip and unzip for more doges
that's what the world needs right now
but make it the same size as the program
actually only put that in the zip, not the program
put a doge pic in the zip and caption it with "doge'd ya again!"
thats the plan ;^)
release a patch with that as the sole patch note
fix not having ? support
please
what did you even fix
dammit i did it again
k
now its on the DESCRIPTION
i fixed it myself
dw
theres shit on the bottom too
i fix

no sorry
it crash ?
does this mod work with ?
soon
I can't send anyone ? all files because I can't put ? in the file name
I always get fed up with my windows updates and yank the cord after a minute or so
later
send me ? all files
that's fair
looking back at it idk what the fuck i expected
i killed its process while it was updating because i didnt want to update it
reinstall linux
good ol gimp takes no time at all
you broke your paint.net?
it's because i based it on the first comment that i saw
because i broke my paint.net install
now il have to wait 5 years for photoshop to load
gah couldnt you crop the image better i want to add it to the deSCRIPTION

I'll send anybody AB+ DLC ALL FILES if they need it
?
ab+ rip
that's a good prank
i should add "enable afterbirth+" and if you check it, the program deletes ab+ files
better luck next dlc
what a shame
portal your code didn't work
<:isaac_troll:245063314697093121>
when set items
i don't press enter
now i know what problem it was
good failsafe
oh lol
thats why you see so many doge avatars in the comments saying "why dont work"
?
genius work, i know
and if they do, it crashes their game
you see it detects if someone is actually unfunny enough to have le mlg parody avatars in 2016
*going to sucide*
thanks
great, that means my new algorithm works
oh no i don't fixed<:isaac_shoop:231218479607316480>

ummm isaac character editor doesnt really edit any.... heroes
...hero
<@162156525337575425> your favorite
guys have a problem with isaac character editor v6.7 when i change hero all items crash
most
does every song in the thing have a layer intro and a loop
sucker
i dont save a backup for anything ever
https://youtu.be/UwUPO023aPc
nice meme
?
do i use isaac unpacker editor basemnet renovator
This is modmaking 101.
You don't save a backup version?
i deleted newest version of my mod rip fixed health bar and new music
because someone has to test it
what else
probably to collect data from it of course but
let me give you this free update
i don't know
Yes, I have Avast.
but 10 might hurt me
but free upgrade to 10
what about avast, that's free
computer came with 8.1 ?
I have a free antivirus and antimalware, and they work great.
eww
ewwww
?
what if i don't have a windows 7? i have windows 8.1
well except for anti malware
right again
wrong again
those cost money
Just get an antivirus and antimalware, and you should be safe against most things.
its so awful
if it's the official site and the exe you download by clicking a link is the name of the product, then you're probably good
how do people unironically use gimp

but i astill am
yes
so i shouldn';t be worried
but ad block helps
and you can close them with google ads
i was gonna link audaictys site but they updated it to not look sketchy
which typically don't include the actual name of the product
yea green with blue
aw
phishing download ads are big and flashy buttons
¯\_(?)_/¯
i'm only 15 can't help me
Free Download Now is a title so it should be capitalized.
not if you're used to the internet
old website
yes
FAKE LOOKING.
SO
JUST.

It just doesn't have CSS.
they both end in y
you mean it looks sketchy?
?
It is real.
looks like it has viruses
not real.
what the fuck does edgy mean if that looks edgy?
If making everything into Steven is changing the theme, then I guess.
yes
this looks so edgy

pepsi
I wouldn't call you my son
dont love me
i wouldnt call them "perfect
your mod's focus is to change the theme via lots of sprites, I assume
which is why I spent most of the time on gameplay
But your sprites are perfect, and your mod focuses on gameplay.
for a mod which is basically a thematic change
if I were you however, I would focus more on respriting as many things as I could pretty well, rather than obsessing over making one thing perfect
I would have to be working on it myself to experiment and see what works best
remake it  5 times
What do you suggest to make it better?
it's probably good enough ingame
<@145740433165647873> Is this a good tearless Steven face? I was having trouble with the shading replacing the tears.
oh fuck of i haven't got any food in fridge?
and i all day made this shit
now in russia 20:51
i know i'm lazy?
RIP
?
so make a mod just with sound
I don't find how fix problem with animation but i know how fix problem with sound
doesn't help?
so thx
That would be my guess.
Try extracting the sound from the ogv in to a separate ogg, then replacing the original intro's sound with the new ogg.
but ogv file have sound
it haven't got any sound
but
i create intro for isaac
i have problem
Hi
hello
i get littlebigplanet psp, metal gear solid, and minecraft for free since I own them on my ps3
well i mean
vita is only worth it for those japanese weeb games
isaac on anything that isnt a keyboard is awful
why
makes me want a vita even more now
and someone has made a mod converter for it
it is
y'know i kinda wonder if isaac rebirth 3ds or vita is moddable
:>
and change basment to asda
change shoel to cathedral
and vice versa
i should change the angel statue to devil statue
mushrooms with skulls
poop with rocks
ankh with 1 up
soy with choco
swap polyphemus and proptosis
lol
i'd rather swap something like breakfast or pentagram with it though
?
oh god that's evil
swap soy milk with egg nog
smol nizomi ecks dee
I could just rename items to what they aren't
¯\_(?)_/¯
make lump of coal black face
s m o l
smol
as for small rock i will literally just put one pixel
confirmed
mom = mettaton's leg
make her a robot
redo mom
redo smol rock
shite
redo mama gurdy
i dont have afterbirth
redo hush
gimme ideas
what sprite should I try to redo
something sharp
thats op
nah nvm
no
start with mom knife
start with 12 black hearts
no
i start with 3 black hearts is that not edgy enough
oh wait
make limt start with a new item called the carrot
NO!
why not black lipstick
not enough edge
http://i.imgur.com/j8poftc.png
winter is eve
to increase the edge
make sure to play as eve too
too OP
all devil items?
canker should start with both cancers
why dont you make yourself start with every EDGY item in the game
wow winter aradia pls
start with the negative
http://i.imgur.com/IXGWKwU.png
ebin
ebin
why
make her start with the negative
why do i start with cancer and cancer

what
powerful combo
portal starts with cancer and cancer
yeah I'm gonna rest up and drink lots of Orange J
yeah I think I'm coming down with some cancer
boss this is a sick call, I gotta stay home today
well, isaac's head is an okay trinket too
indeed
i prefer the trinket
wew.
WELL THEN
wow rude
that is true of every mod
¯\_(?)_/¯
my mods are for personal use only unless I feel like releasing them
of course
any time!
idk tbh
wasnt it supposed to work with the shared ones too
I think shared  copies work
and not have it shared
you have to own the game on your account
shared as in family share?
i think
uuuh
do you own the game on steam
skull one is okay
*which one though the skull edit for the item room or the item altar*
hate that sprite
badsprite.jpg
*badsprite.jpg*
Eyyyyyy
but this is
Rip
That's not a gif
Well then

pls
Oh no indeed.
Oh no
Make it a hit sound if some type
Is that a tear hit sound
Is it just a video?
why you do this
OH NO
<@159492166542950401> linked it
it's not a soundboard
<@145740433165647873> Nice soundboard
OH NO
That's why __they__ said maybe
...
maybe he's right
Make it triple then
It's only a single outline.
Triple outline instead of double
Then tell me how to do the outline.
no that's effort
<@129339380090404864> Do the whole mod for me.
Whenever you get hit make the noise https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=xuSEPdSkjLE
Wait who's been making the meme mod
do it for him
you aren't even doing the mouth/eye outlines correctly
Hhhaa
The Binding of Fcuk You: Blackface Edition
The Binding of Fcuk?
yeah prob
This is it without the shading. It looks slightly better.
try any ol crazy shit until something looks good
<@167363485326508033> <@145740433165647873> How do I properly doing the area under Steven's eye. It looks bad in both the darker and lighter color.
also what pajeet said they need to be thicker
you only need the aa
get rid of the outlines around the eyes/mouth
the eyes of the droopy face guys look weird
<@167363485326508033> Any suggestions for these enemies?
DARKER GREY
If it's any darker, it will just look like the same color as the face.
darker grey
Ew
guess I never thought of it that way
i have only two and yet they're both really hard
it's like dicks
how can they be hard, there's only 12 of them
pixels are hard
it's complete insanity
that's a glowing effect
that's not anti aliasing anymore if you do that
not all around
so only slip a dark grey pixel in the corners
i said slight anti aliasing lol
they dont rly fit steven imo
remove tears
This looks like shit.
I hate anti aliasing.
the outline really brings out the blackface
maybe the white part could use some slight anti aliasing
not sure the black outline around the eyes and mouth is necessary
<@167363485326508033> Is my Steven sprite good? I've already done a lot of costumes, but I can always change them.
yeah that's an improvement
<@167363485326508033> Is this better?
Alright, on it.
that'd be around 1 pixel in your spritesheet
look at how close the eyes are to the mouth

only the eyes
I moved everything down 2-3 pixels.
that's not any different
<@167363485326508033> Is this better?
if you're still confused, read the tutorial on the modding reddit again
Fuck, it's an exe
you want to construct the same path within resources
find the pills within the unpacked afterbirth folder
use the rebirth unpacker on the packed afterbirth file
what path contains the files for pills
make it happen
Nope
<@!224945708090916864> did you get your gay muffins working?
do it if you dare
Need to do Ludo eyes

I hate doing mouth sprites for Steven.

Oh
Oh
This mod:
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2551/immersive-hitsound-mod-
And I died after clearing a double monstro II room on the chest
I'm upset, I had quad shot, tiny rock, curved horn, everything
Yeah
<@126464027663532032> You are playing OG Isaac?
I died in eternal chest. Ugh
Oh mk.
<@!117109151334662144> No, we already have enough buffed Keeper mods.
I'm streaming gameplay as him.
...maybe... what it do?
Should I upload my Buffed keeper as a stand alone mod?
I buffed the keeper,but I don't know if it's to much.
just as a hilarious joke by nicalis!
Ok
...
As far as I know it's hardcoded
Do you guys know how to make it where the keeper doesn't have the wooden nickel?
Oh.
I'm saying keep modding chat here
Is this part of the ARG?
<@147076393937797121> Was that it?
Thanks for the amazing suggestion. ?
Because he is chocolate people
I'd like to buy all your chocolate
Oh.
Now that I've got you right where I want you
Hey
Hey
<@147076393937797121>
Yes?
Pls no
???
make a mod which simply erases all outlines from all sprites
¯\_(?)_/¯
Make a mod just a for double outlines
Screw you, tyrony. Stop making rules and not following them.
uees it does
Why not?
n o
Doesn't this disobey the double outline rule?
better luck next time
I guess I have to work harder.
Wow, he didn't think that my mod was good enough to steal.
ThinkingP

Jer is a demon.
But jer you're neither
I left and rejoined once, and I still had my demon tag.
demon plz
he left and rejoined
???
Idk
<@159492166542950401> How did you lose your demon tag?
be a daemon installer
I wonder...
Should I go back to daemon
shame we didn't get him to be a demon
thats how probably
Oh
Probably
the first ep is free
Refund
What
But played life is strange
Only has 1 game
worse than playing nothing
hey, he might have played up to a twentieth of an hour of life is strange
exigua get a fucking life
isaac is literally the only thing he plays
MY MOD ROCKS
http://i.imgur.com/jOftNyW.png
they're basically the same thing
he keeps shilling his mod in godmode comments too i think
He updated the game again. Time to see if he used any of my sprites.
his precious coins!!!!
kek
It's probably the same reason why he uploads the same version of his mod 5 times.
Okay RIP exigua's coins
?????
like <@246712577307049984> what the fuck is your problem
and then comments the same thing again
like he comments 2 days ago
exigua only commented my mod once u_u
http://i.imgur.com/wNSombn.png
If he keeps spamming ?
^
dude exigua is fucking killing it with the spam everywhere
Oh no
Oh no, Pieczy, Portal, and EXIGUA commented on my mod. This can't be good.
Because they are difficult.
Why are the coolest mods always abandoned ? ? 
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/659/animated-items-pack-rebirth
I've started trying to add Character Icons, before I do anything with the animations and stuff.
Its great
idk about all this...
its 10 outta 10 I swear
I'm not so sure about this mod
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2551/immersive-hitsound-mod-
you bet
well that's easy as fuck
that's what that giant-ass list is for
yes
for character names I could just use the bible names right?
also, randomizing achievement unlocks
random characters in general
adding character names into the other pools?
character names?
I think
what about item names and descriptions? are you done with those?
what is started but not finished
idk
what do you still need to do?
u
no
<@!128874748041101312> you tell me, a-hole
nice, good
hell yeah ill add this to my collection of isaac character editor mod hard drives right away
Only one tech does something.
What should I get rid of?
Too OP
Is this also OP? It's on azazel. Lil' Brimstone, Technology 2, Technology
Ikr.
Robo-Baby is best bot smh
Keep the Tech X
That's what I thought since it's a bot.
Brimstone
Wait no
Tech x
¯\_(?)_/¯
Should I get rid of Tech X or Brimstone. I'm keeping one of them.
I'll give them buffs.
I haven't edited them yet.
Keeper and Maggy need buffs.
lol
Lost is good as it is
Good to know.
Mk.
Too OP
I think I made things fair in the mod. Kinda??? I won a run with 600 bot (AKA Lost that starts with tech X and brimstone)
If you unpack all the r.zip files
if you play well enough you fight the secret carrot boss
No carrots 0/10
would have totally just left it if no one had mentioned it to me
I didn't even pay attention or check to see if I could download it
You need an icon, not a screenshot.
spooking didn't work the first day after it was uploaded because all the uploads corrupted somehow lol
It said I needed one.
excited to see how the ab+ editor will stack up
You can upload no screenshots...
Her little character editor is growing up! ??
and hand labels them
I'll bet she's so proud
on a separate external drive
she saves each and every one
Because I didn't have a screenshot.
<@162156525337575425> see what beauties your work has created
Why is there a screenshot from Miitomo?
Bonk is just blue baby with soy milk.
I also, didn't intend for them to all be op.
I said I just edited properties.
Oh look, it is another character starting items mod. Yippee.
Portal would be proud
I made this mod.
I used it
I did.
Download isaaac character editor
I didn't upload it
I did that a couple nights ago
I basically just used the character editor to make a bad mod.
...k
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2550/mister600-character-powers-thingy I didn't have a screenshot, so I used that. You guys also probably know how to install it anyway.
You go on the website and click on "Upload a Mod".
How do I do that?
Upload it to moddingofisaac.com
I got to upload it to mediafire.
please be a mod
I think what the site needs is more meme mods
It's not a meme mod.
Please don't be a meme mod.
Please don't be a meme mod.

idk count it
how long will it take me to make the randomizer
if I do 1 feature a day
you silly goose
how could my amazing code not work
of course it fucking works
thats what you get for falling for the notepad++ meme
wowwww
but it didn't this time
or whatever
pajeet pls
usually it says `this file has been changed`
you're fucking me up
nevermind notepad++ fucked me up
oh
it doesn't even change the fucking item naems
it works for me even if i save to the same file
wait
are you SURE it doesnt change?
ok what the fuck did pm2k do
???
>erialize this XDocument to a file, overwriting an existing file, if it exists.
lemme look it up
scary
I guess I'll just delete it and save it
yeah
but not to items.xml?
I mean it works if I save it to another file
just what the fuck are you doing exactly that makes it not work
cruel troll
god fucking dammit
nevermind it doesn't
BOR##ing......
you're welcome
oh it works now
i didnt try to make it save to the same file
try saving it to a different file first?
to the file
it makes no changes
cause it doesn't work
am I doing this right
```csharp
            if (mode == 1)
            {
                var xml = XDocument.Load(@"resources\items.xml");

                foreach (var child in xml.Root.Elements().Where(child => child.Name != "trinket"))
                {
                    if (child.Name != "trinket")
                    {
                        var choice = RandomInt(0, 3);
                        if (choice == 0) child.Name = "passive";
                        else if (choice == 1) child.Name = "active";
                        else if (choice == 2) child.Name = "familiar";
                    }
                }
                xml.Save(@"resources\items.xml");
            }```
heah
o
um
nevermind
what
just copy paste the entire thing i did and replace the `rng` with your random int
XDOCUMENT
god damnit
`var xml = XDocument.Load(@"C:\Users\porta\Desktop\items.xml");`
...look at the code i posted again
`var xml = new XmlDocument();`
post that line
where you make `var xml`
what do you mean
what
the file
post me the line where you're loading shit
...pajeet
what the fuck
yes
system.xml then?
yes
did you do using system.xml.linq
youre doing something wrong
as i said

hahah crazy ol limt
limt please
how DOES it work?
i assume i wont have to explain you how the `Where` works this time
thank
o ok
make sure to have `using System.Xml.Linq;` on top aswell
<@128874748041101312>
```csharp
var xml = XDocument.Load(@"C:\Users\porta\Desktop\items.xml");
foreach (var child in xml.Root.Elements().Where(child => child.Name != "trinket"))
{
    var choice = rng.Next(0, 3);
    if (choice == 0) child.Name = "passive";
    else if (choice == 1) child.Name = "active";
    else if (choice == 2) child.Name = "familiar";
}
```
what
this is tHE FINAL STRAWAW
what
why
if you say "what" one more time ill snap
linq to xml has mutable names
what
told you to use linq to xml >.>
o
lemme finish it up ill send
yeah i figured it out <@128874748041101312> , in a much simpler way too
wow
<@162156525337575425> my friend finally reshared
wow
you have to be exceptionally encouraging though
ill add you to special thanks for motivation
add me to special thanks
no but she really always does tho
nontraditional way
in her way
portal always contributes
even portal is contributing!
tyty lemme see if i can come up with something
```csharp
                XmlDocument xml = new XmlDocument();
                xml.Load(@"resources\items.xml");
                var xmlItems = xml.SelectSingleNode("//items").ChildNodes;
                foreach (XmlNode item in xmlItems)
                {
                    if (item.Name != "trinket")
                    {
                        var choice = RandomInt(0, 2);
                        
                        if (choice == 0)
                        {
                            item.Name = "active";           
                        }
                    }
                }```
post the part where you get `xmlItems` too i dont feel like figuring that out myself tbh
```csharp
                foreach (XmlNode item in xmlItems)
                {
                    if (item.Name != "trinket")
                    {
                        var choice = RandomInt(0, 2);
                        
                        if (choice == 0)
                        {
                            item.Name = "active";           
                        }
                    }
                }```
can you pm me the entire code for that specific xml part
is this not very stupid however?

yes
pajeet are you sure about it being readonly?
I wrote a manual xml parser for my enemy populator
well you can always do it manually
the node name is readonly
HMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmm...
yeah I know but is the script not working and in which way is it not
by xml parsing
he probably means renaming it automatically
like do your fingers slip off they keyboard when you try to touch it?
what precisely do you mean by you can't rename it?
also i like the randomize unlock idea
xml is cancer
dunno
like active passive familiar
<@!173420370773147649> I can't rename the node thing
as well as choose percentage of how many of the game items are locked by default
<@128874748041101312> <@!173420370773147649> could be an option for "randomize unlocks" so people could start a new save file and unlock random items as they clear achievements and fill the notepads etc
nay
go draw me some lesbians kilburn
same
im gay
YOU ARE
get a load of these nerds
what
is it true?
you can't change the node type
oh for fucks sake
I haven't made it yet
swift send me items active testing files
hardcore
it was my first language so I have *some* affection for it
I haven't tried it but from what I know I can see a few small redeeming qualities
As long as you have no affection for python your sins can be forgiven
but it's useful in *some* situations
I don't *love* it
As long as you don't love python your sins can be forgiven
I've spent a ton programming, I've just never been interested in anything that requires C
maybe not that much
probably at least like 300 or some shit
huh how many hours of my life have I spent programming
windows doesn't need an excuse
idk man I've spent like 5 hours of my life in visual studio
<@173420370773147649> You can use any number for active charges. It's the one thing Nicalis did not hardcode.
looks okay
it's a cold hard fact that tada is best sound
restart if you can't figure it out
check task manager, see if something's eating your memory
you tell me, bucko
why is visual studio so fucking laggy today
works for now
?
so I'm willing to investigate and see if I can compile a list of interesting effects or something
yeah but we don't want to change an active/passive state and cause an item to not work at all, that would be dumb and boring
because people dont read tooltips
id put it in brackets behind it
what im unsure about is changing stuff to familiar
changing passives to active almost fully works
it's just a tooltip
I could test it after the active thing
well, we know that for most it does nothing
we might figure out what precisely we can change which still works
I think we should test what changing them actually does
or "very unstable"
well we don't really know
can cause unexpected things, including crashes
`Not Recommended! Can cause your game to`
what should the warning for extreme item types be
maybe additionally send me a version with all charges set to the 0 timed charge
see what we can learn for sure
in fact, <@128874748041101312> if you want to whip up a version of the items file with all the active booleans inverted, I could test that today
well we can experiment, this isn't a triple heart bypass or anything
<@66197463593136128>
will it use the undivided if you choose from 7 to 11?
everything should have options
oh
what
if you put more it will use the undivided one i think
should those have options or no
oh right
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12
if that would still work
I'm guessing we either have to stay within that set of numbers or replace them all with an undivided charge bar graphic
there are set ones yes
actually, there are specific graphics meant for charge bars with X amount of charges right?
or a less wacky option of randomly add or subtract one or two
there could be a wacky option of just randomly pick whatever
as for randomizing active charges
so time will inform us what we should prioritize
but we don't even know how many people will run the randomizer at all rather than just using prepackages
yeah the ui is pretty shit right now
if the randomizer takes off after release I could even design a custom animated isaac themed UI
why is visual studio so laggy
there's no way that we'll reach any sort of max capacity for options
the randomizer i gave you had a small one
>make the window bigger
make another page of tabs
and make the window bigger
unlikely
fill all the tabs and have no room for other tabs
you do know that you can add additional pages right
how would you run out of space
k
fuk off
until you run out of space
nice spelling
more options are always nice
sure
we can decide whether it should be in the default preset once we're nearly done and we can actually test the thing
considering that isaac is already inherently random and completely different in game pace from something like pokemon
regardless, a simple option to do a simple thing like ensure chaos can't hurt
yes
probably all people
most people will want to use it like a corruptor
well yeah, thats the thing
most people who use it will just want to use it for wacky crazy isaac
I think very few people will have the patience or interest in relearning item pools
maybe it would, but that's why I suggested it just be an option
yeah presets
etc
were youll need to relearn what itempool has what
additional options are always nice but giving the characters chaos would kinda defeat the point of a permament randomizer
yeah I'm planning to add presets
imo
based on what we personally expect will be the most interesting
there should be certain states which the readme or the ui or however you choose these things at least recommends
nothing is a default :v
that's fine, just keep the weights optional and don't make it a default
in fact, I'd add in a boolean option to give every character chaos
there's no point in removing it now
well I've already made it anyway
nevermind
oh wait no I'm retarded
my point is that there are so many items that nobody is going to have more fun just because it takes them forever to find an item, given that any item which might randomly be made very rare is probably going to be a regular boring item anyway
yeah
wait what
the bomberman item
or whatever it's called
and wrath's bombs for some reason
and certain more common
it makes certain items rarer
um
except for mega
it doesn't make anything interesting in any way
weights are already all 1
Because it's a randomizer?
there's no point in making them random, nothing to be gained
why tho
either normalize all the weights to 1, or don't change
as for weights, I would say the same thing
Just replaced it out with a balanced weight system
some people might still want to avoid broken synergies to the extent that the game intends, for challenge
The Mystified mod removes specials I believe
yeah give the option to either disable special or leave it alone
And stick with weights
Good, you should just disable specials then
the special flag sucks, it hardly works at all, mostly it's just annoying

well for randomization
Special items are a band aid fix
there already is one
I prefer a weight system personally
applying it randomly to mundane items wouldn't be interesting and no one would even notice it
yeah
it's meant to make broken synergies less likely
if you see a special item, it drastically reduces your chance to see another special item
for special items
oh yeah the algorithm
a special is a unique flag which means
what does it even do
give the option to either set them all to 0 or to leave them as they are
regarding special, I stand by the idea that there is no reason to randomize the special flag
the other mode is only some
extreme is like a lot of the things changing
we have little idea what that could or would do, do we not?
Do those first
there'll be 2 modes, extreme and something
Those.
active, passive, familiar
what does randomize item types mean?
SO, regarding these
so should I do characters or these
ok then
any change can't be worse
pills in ab suck *the dick*
alongside one of those joy masks, maybe ill post them here later
hah, I already made a joy item for rebirth a while ago

https://i.redd.it/0bsdu66iysyx.png
I saw this image on Reddit and I was wondering what Isaac would've looked like if it was Joy instread
because steam ends up opening it instead
I haven't had any drm issues while editing memory live, the only issue I've had with drm is not being able to open multiple clients at once for testing and having to wait for the isaac-ng process to appear rather than opening it through shell or by some other means
I don't think so
Isn't that required for exe modding anyways?
That being said it's a very easy game to make a personal crack of, just gotta remove steam stub
<@88415148867358720> there is no legal DRM free version of the game
yes seems to generally work
Rewritten kinda vanished as did everything else he was working on
?
Whatever the reason, he did stop, I know that much
whatever
dont even know how it started, someone musta saw that he doesnt mod anymore and was like "oh nicalis musta told him to stop
Probably just didn't feel like messing with Afterbirth then
yeah I thought that was debunked
he didnt get one
He wasn't just working on co-op but also on "rewritten" which was community remix (and tons more) for rebirth but it all kinda dropped
^
kewl
I've heard it both ways, he got one, he didn't get one, I don't know at this point
<@129339380090404864> Well, not only that but it is rumored that he got a Cease and Desist.
when i say own, I mean each player must have an up to date executable. there's no easy way for me to enforce that players own the game on steam because many people, afaik, got it drm-free from the humble store (or maybe it was gog). even if i did try to enforce steam ownership, it would be easily circumvented. i don't condone piracy but putting protection against it isn't possible with the various copies that exist and even if only steam copies existed, it would be easily cracked and just a waste of time.
online co-op requires each player own the latest version of afterbirth though
with local co-op, no, because that will be like standard co-op where other players use other controllers on a single computer but instead of controlling co-player babies they can choose regular characters and get items, spend money, etc.
since this is an exe mod will the other party have to own the game for it to function? ? ?
nice
i'm planning on having the multiplayer mod (both the online portion and local co-op) to be very configurable so that could be added in
<@129339380090404864> that could be done
i dont really see a need to divide it
kilburn is good at coding, art, and game design and i have none of thoise
what's wrong with having the players share health though
I'm jealous as hell
I'm impressed though ;v
unless he created it himself, which is demon magic i think
show off
i should be able to replicate everything he did in his videos, the only thing I'm not sure how he did was some of the UI additions that are not default. i'm assuming there is a co-player check somewhere that tests whether or not a player should have item UI and other stuff show up because by default it is only hearts.
That's cool, I loved the stuff he showed off in his videos, was damn impressive.
Oh he's around here? Rad. I'm new, by the way. Hi.
<@148680153239781376> it's not like he's gone, he just doesn't mod anymore. he'll still answer your questions if you have any
<@129339380090404864> he did, but updates/afterbirth's release made all of his work obsolete due to offset and code changes
he was in here yesterday
I miss kilburn. What happened to him?
this is so gay
didnt kilburn make a co-op mod though, like im not sure what was preventing him from releasing that?
yes
exe modding?
how are you doing this exactly?
local co-op is pretty simple and the gameplay changes that will need to be made can be translated to the online mod
oh thats cool
i'll *probably* be releasing local co-op before the multiplayer mod as a stand-alone mod but when the online multiplayer is complete the local co-op will be built into it <@170949041520246784> <@129339380090404864>
I'll change them to use something that sounds more like an octoling
<@196449185044627468> Will you use Octoling voice clips?
Oh, they are officially called Elite Octolings.
i see

i googled "high ranking octoling" and the first result was a minecraft skin
you all are giving me an excuse to kick you for spamming :>
That's why the high ranking Octolings have.
im not familiar with the nintendo lore
It's seaweed.
why does the green one have horns
Oh, I like how the fast ones are the high ranking Octolings.
good question

is there any mod to play it online coop?
rip
ok yeah i did
hmm red hearts didn't change upon gameplay testing so i think i need to fix it
since i could not even tell the difference in the file (makeing the mod due to my diluted color perception) im just kinda wingging it
also im not sure if i accedently made the dark hearts red
Though I might be wrong
I think you can also save as 32-bit using windows paint too
lemme see if it works
ahh i saved as auto
^
ye
you gotta go in paint.net (or whatever software) and save it as a 32 bit
aight lemme try that
you need to save the file in 32 bit color depth or smthing
haha you mean like red boxes with a silhoutted center
yes
im useing this pickup_001_heart.png but it seems to cause a strange bug where all the hearts are big red boxes
what
im just not sure i have the right file
hmm im trying to make "yet another hearts mod" but this time instead of only the health bar ones im trying to re color the pickups

it's pretty decent proof

Portal is a girl, but also a trap.
I mean most angles look like traps
I can't imagine why it wouldn't be
if portal refers to herself as a girl then that's good enough for me
Yes, Portal is a trap.
not a girl
He's a GIRL

Yeah, I meant as in conforming to rebirth style
i just used the original items as ref

Okay, so I went into the giant books folder to get a book to change for a mod, what the hell is this?
yeah i don't think that you can have only globins make octoling sounds right now
ohhh
Not that I care
So other enemies would make octoling-esque noises
No, I meant sounds aren't specific to one enemy
genius naming
heart sound = boss bubbles 2
it's like a game of memory
just gotta use your ears i guess
Put it on the 'end-of-the-year' list
Oh well
yeah, unfortunately
But the sounds in this game aren't very specific
you can replace existing sounds with new ones pretty sure
No but seriously, what can I do with sounds atm
looks plenty final to me
Here's the (hopefully) final version of the regular globin
i mean, i dont know where the hitbox is
even if it isnt it functions exactly like it though right
I'm gonna stick with the oval, but have to be more splatter-y and fade out
But it isn't, and I wouldn't want people getting confused
having it fade would also help with the illusion of it being creep
yeah
I think creep is circular primarily for gameplay reasons, while shadows are ovals because of the games """perspective"""
really only shadows look like that
Hmm
i would try seeing how a circular puddle of creep would look?
that's a good question actually
<@129339380090404864> do you think the ellipsoidal puddle works, or would a circular puddle ala creep be better
lovin it
good
Ink splash
ah
<@129339380090404864> It's a placeholder
^
**you only get to pick once**
don't wanna ban you
watch your language guys
he*ck
but otherwise that is a h*cking good sprite
my advice would be to look at the creep sprites and try to replicate that
the ink pool looks weird, like its supposed to be a shadow and not a liquid
?
Oh
<@180832454213500929> inb4 in before

MORE LAYERS. WE NEED MORE LAYERS, DARNIT.
is 0x28 whether or not the player is a coplayer?
thanks
yeah it's 1b9c on afterbirth
it's probably further down for afterbirth
for rebirth
0xB98
it should work even if it's from rebirth, or at least be close
do you have the offset for that?
and that one definitely changes
but there's a character id somewhere much further down
yeah the subtype never changes
you're looking at the subtype
ah i see
so unless im using the wrong offset for the subtype, it doesn't change after death
this is at 0x2c offset
that's pretty odd
if I leave and continue the run it changes
still 0x08
https://i.gyazo.com/08440a676742c1b6f93fe68fe1d0aacc.png
i'm pretty sure revived lazarus is a completely different character
let me double check
that sounds unlikely though
unless they changed it in afterbirth?
the character id isn't changing after I die unless I restart the run
different character id
<@167363485326508033> is there a bool for whether or not lazarus has been revived?
Is it decided by their ID, or what order they're put in the animation itself?
How do I know what layers of an animation show on top of eachother?
Question for people here who are familiar with animations
the mushroom sounds don't even sound like mushrooms
the mushroom sounds are recorded awfully
yes
it's literally named pot breaking sound.wav
oh
i bet it's ghost fight increased to 300 bpm
sped up
i bet it's the pot breaking sound
<:poo:230363864724799488>
<@167363485326508033> that makes a lot more sense, thanks
<@88415148867358720> weird question, but is there a way you can check what sound effect the coin/nail tears make on impact, i cant find them in afterbirths files i beluve its sped up of a rebirth sound
bitfield
<@167363485326508033> do you know how the black heart int works? upon first glance i have no idea how the integer is representing the number/position of black hearts out of soul hearts
What do I do for animations where it won't show? Do I just not include it in the layeranimations?
I already defined the new spritesheet and its respective layer
Okay, so I'll need some help with getting the ink splat onto this animation
that's a really nice animation
<@196449185044627468> ?

Going from purple to red more gradually
After a whole day, here's the octoling transformation. All from scratch. Still needs a few tweaks to the palette
<@88415148867358720> it was just giving me a different address altogether
its like a little plop
cute
IntPtr has such a misleading name
it has a tears down aswell
as strange as it sounds, maybe IntPtr just isn't defined as an "integral" type in c#? i'm not entirely sure
<@128874748041101312> what line was giving the error?
like with how bosses die, but in reverse
im pretty sure you could get away with having just a few large blood gushes
with how rebirth handles animations you wouldnt need a whole lot of frames or detail for it to fit in
you're a kid now
you're a squid now
Well, yes, but each of their squid limbs corresponds to a kid limb, and the head has a consistent movement to it, etc

Console.WriteLine(address.ToString("X"));
``` doesn't
ow  my heart
it gets me the right address
?
schedule a prostate exam
so ```csharp
Console.WriteLine(Program.sharp.Read<IntPtr>(Program.sharp.Read<IntPtr>(Program.sharp.Read<IntPtr>(Program.sharp.Read<IntPtr>(baseAddr, false) + offset1, false) + offset2, false) + offset3, false).ToString("X"));

Splatoon ain't the only game the mod has nods to (props to anyone who can name all of these)
Yes, female inkling.
Oh, that'd work well, especially if its another inkling (i'm assuming)
And it would make people actually want to play as Magdalene.
Mysterious Liquid would be good.
Welp
It's hardcoded to recolor normal tears.
Number One doesn't use different tears.
nope
Number one? If that even has unique graphics and just doesn't rely on tint
What item could I give Magdalene that would do close to nothing but affect her tears?
A better solution should become available by next year
And give isaac that item by default
Well, you could make it specific to an item
Is there any way to make tears different for different characters?
K, just asking
Yes.
I know, but won't other characters have ink tears then
It is ink because their hair color is always the same as their ink color.
*raises hand*
Are those tears somehow specific to the inkling, or is it just the general stuff
robobaby disagrees
No problems I can see

If all else fails, you could just ctrl+f in the costume files
There's something about it on tje reddit, I think
Yes. I think the id is 50? I'm not 100% sure
I don't remember
Do I just edit players.xml?
So I need to know how to set the costume to Isaac.
I made a costume because my sprite didn't fit.
What
<@196449185044627468> <@128874748041101312> Isaac Character Editor doesn't let you start with blank or Eve's Head, so how do I set it to Isaac?
There are no other Inkling as Isaac mods, right?
gl
It's just tweaking a few dimension and croppage values in a text document, nothing TOO challenging
Use another big costume sheet like Eve's head for reference
Make the costume files larger in the anims. Much easier than in a character sheet
Then give isaac the blank costume with a character editor
And it doesn't fit on the blank costume.
But this character will always be Isaac.
Yes, there's an unused costume in the game that can be assigned to a character. Especially useful for those that don't have one normally
Blank costume?
If it isn't (isaac, spoiler characters), then you can use the 'blank' costume
If its a character with a head layer (most) it should just paste it on top
Yes, but how do I do it for the default sprite?
It should fit fine in the animation group (here)
I was asleep a minute ago rip
that was a solid minute ago
<@66197463593136128> im pretty aware of how shit python is
<@196449185044627468> And how do I know which ones it will be cut off for?
What item do I make the costume for, though?
That's a lot of bull you'd have to readjust. Just try making a default head in the character sheet, and use a costume for the big stuff that needs replacing
Yes.
<@!182509747835109387> Wait, are you planning on rearranging the character sheet to fit a bigger head sprite
if I were you I'd just do what's convenient right now and save the really annoying stuff for ab+
Shit.
<@!182509747835109387> Yes
Is that even possible yet, or do I have to wait till the end of the year
probably
around 30% opacity
Do I have to change the anm2 file if my sprite is bigger than the Isaac sprite?
the ones that don't usually have an antialias
yeah
the things which include flesh tone and shit are all that need changed
a single spritesheet huh
if a costume doesn't include anything conflicting then it's fine as is
That only has one spritesheet, not specific to any color. Does the game somehow pick up on alternatives and fallback on the default if there aren't any?
the game will detect black skin colors
if you pick up, say, a devil related item
am I the only person on earth who uses gimp for image editing at this point
But lets say I wanted to do that with triple shot
the game checks for skin colors depending on the items you've picked up
I've got that down, I can do that on characters and stuff
Global only works for the same spritesheet, though.
use global bucket on paint.net
But how do you get the game to check for that?
I imagine a lot of the people who want to see resprites wouldn't mind them not being covered up by costumes immediately
a tip for coloring every sprite of the same color:
alternately, you can just remove costumes which conflict if you want to be lazy
simple, just copy and paste all the features
I must know
How do you do this
What
You have to redo the costumes for all skin colors.
Yes.
Actually that brings up a problem: you know how your character's skin changes color depending on what items you have?
Ears are not meant to be on Isaac.
a challenge to balance the ears with such few pixels
Btw the left lens is cracked because cain
<@!182509747835109387> Here's my attempt at an inkling character from a while ago. Scrapped the mask- looks like crap with the glasses
us modders demand such high standards of decadence
it sucks without i dunno maybe an editor that wouldn't require restarting the game over and over
I have
No.
<@!182509747835109387> have you animated anything from scratch before?
Ew
hallelujah
agreed
**Then change for the good of nonshitposts**
Ears are going to be a pain in the ass.
Ehhhh, it'd work for now
Is this better for the shading?
Sounds like something I'd enjoy
sounds like good practice
Nothing serious
A clusterfuck of sprite improvements, dead memes, injokes, games from the 90's seemingly nobody but me knows of, more relevant games, and frogs
third person shooters released in may 2015?
what's the theme?
Just a miscellaneous initial foray into game development and digital "art"

<@196449185044627468> What is the mod?
WIP = work in progress
Its part of a larger mod I'm working on

<@182509747835109387> its replaces the globin
oh by WIP I thought you meant it was finished
le old repeat meme
I know. I have not done shading yet.
yeah could use shading
yeah could use shading
69 cents
it would be a little better if you had more shading on the hair and eyebrows or if <@196449185044627468> made it
How much does it cost
it's not bad
WIP. Thoughts?
<@196449185044627468> Do you want to cooperate on this mod? I have some good ideas for characters and items, and I can sprite.
<:poo:230363864724799488>
??
who cares, this one probably looks better
Or does it just turn Isaac into an Inkling?
Isn't there already a Splatoon mod?
I agree
looks hella nice
i code mine in .anim
/sarcasm
This is gonna be so much fun to animate, you guys have no idea
Hoo boy
So, I'm working on a globin replacement
no shit
its only illegible if u cant read it
brevity is the soul of wit
it's beautiful
how the fuck is [::-1] clear and concise? it is the opposite of legible
wait you wont have power for a week?
according to stackoverflow, the definition of pythonic to them is "Exploting [sic] the features of the Python language to produce code that is clear, concise and maintainable."
time to switch to python
sounds pretty cool to me

python is ugly and you should never learn it
except for python
Mash keys until it works
It's just like every other programming language
Yeah Lua is super easy to learn
it shouldn't be taking this long
did you learn yet?
better learn then
I don't. ?
in lua
he reprograms himself every day
robo-baby knows lua
I can't imagine it not being true
everyone here
i heard even donald trump knows lua
some do it accidentally
a literal toddler could do it
it's very simple
yes
tell him it's super easy and simple in every way
no, lie to him
it's mostly boolean expressions and loops, come to think of it
there's a lot more to scripting/programming than just function calls
c_debugspawn("preset",1)
Unofficial
there's like
Also
That's one I know
GetPlayer().components.builder:GiveAllRecipes()
I know how to work DST console a bit
for good reason
lua is becoming pretty damn popular come to think of it
also jc2mp
I think don't starve uses it
yeah. gmod and computercraft come to mind
you could learn it just through standard api but a lot of games use lua already
gmod is a good way to fuck around
depends on how you want to learn
ehh
Does it require not playing games
no
Does it require school
go learn it and find out
simple, but still useful
What is lua <:ThinkingP:235495982870036481>
lua is pretty babyish
lua is pretty simple
Someone make a baby scripting tool
But I don't have $
can't wait to hack the api to make mods that execute shellcode
learn lua so you're ready to mod in ab+
Well back to not trying to mod at all.
?
Yes probably I can't code
you probably can't do the peeper thing you mentioned regardless
So I could be lazy and mirror the peeper current eye or make one slightly guttier

do it then, sucker
I need to stop ? of mods and make them!!!
more of this eyeball obsession
Reduce it

Peeper base dmg
a homing peeper
that would be pretty strong i think
Homing property to that peeper then
can you get a 3rd peeper because 3rd eye
what if you get spoon bender
Idk why though
Add a mod that adds the other peeper and when you get both you get damage up (because you have no eyes for tears so it's blood and blood = more dmg)
ty
```csharp
var test;
```
csharp
also, how did you get the multiline code formatting to work with c#? it wasn't working for me
yeah
you have to be careful with relative and absolute addresses, because you're reading an address from the pointer at `addr` you no longer have an offset, instead you have an absolute address. you need to specify isRelative as false
I forgot to specify that it wasn't relative
oh wait
it's the `Console.WriteLine(sharp.Read<int>(addr))` that errors
```csharp
            var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetProcessesByName("nuclearthrone")[0]);
            var addr = sharp.Read<IntPtr>((IntPtr)0x005CEAB4);
            Console.WriteLine(sharp.Read<int>(addr));``` this is all my code is, I don't see any problem with it
hmph
ayyyyy it works
lmk if you have any other issues
or maybe it is just my version
I have MemorySharp added to the solution so I don't have that issue
thanks a lot for helping
oh it works if I change the target platform
thanks robo-baby, appreciate ya
I think it's unrelated to the exception
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10113532/how-do-i-fix-the-visual-studio-compile-error-mismatch-between-processor-archit
I've never had that warning before
but I get this ```Severity    Code    Description    Project    File    Line    Suppression State

```
is the process object valid? or maybe your application just doesn't have access to the application for some reason? not really sure
yeah it still doesn't work
4.5.2
what net framework are you using?
not sure, I haven't come across that exception before
System.Diagnostics.Process
using a procId or a proc object?
when I try to instantiate a `MemorySharp`
I'm getting this error
oh
GameRef is just the main game class that I have defined, I'm using one MemorySharp object across the entire program rather than having multiple... although now that I think about it I think i'm going to change that
there is an optional bool argument "isRelative" which defaults to true, so you can specify that as false if you are using a standard address rather than an offset
wait what exactly is GameRef?
ahh
but you get the point
ffs discord code formatting sucks
for example, I can get the address of the "main menu" object in Boi afterbirth using the pointer at `"isaac-ng.exe"+0x2EE0A0` by doing this: 
```csharp
GameRef.MainMenuAddress = GameRef.Sharp.Read<IntPtr>((IntPtr)0x2EE0A0);
```
yeah
MemorySharp has generics as well so things are a lot simpler rather than having a ton of overloads for read/write
as far as I can tell VAMemory isn't open source so things aren't really obvious and with MemorySharp you can modify anything to your liking in the context of your project
yeah I should probably switch
If you have more troubles with VAMemory and you're willing to redo part of whatever you're working on, I'd recommend MemorySharp which is the library that I'm using
I also don't know if it has a ReadPtr function, but if it doesn't you could do ReadInt32 or ReadInt and cast it to IntPtr to get value of the address, in your case from the offset `005CEAB4`
I can't seem to find any kind of documentation on VAMemory but from what it looks like, you don't need to specify the base address. The location argument of WriteByte is just IntPtr pOffset so I'm assuming it already adds that to the base address in its respective functions.
it seems to work though
I'm using a library called VAMemory in c#, don't know if it's any good
how are you doing it programmatically
I'm using both, neither of them seem to work
how exactly are you trying to read the memory? like are you doing it manually through cheat engine or some programming language?
I don't know what that is
are you accounting for little endianness?
I don't have nuclear throne
it's within nuclear throne
is it within BoI? I could check for you
weird
still doesn't point to the correct address
ah
I haven't had to use the pointer scanner or any of the pointer features because the pointers that BoI uses are explicitly read from in almost all of the functions
I don't remember 100% correctly because I haven't actually used many of the pointer features (the scanner and the pointers that can be added to tables), but you should be able to get the base address of the process aka `"processname.exe"` and then add the offset `005CEAB4` to it, then from that resulting address the value should either be `093B6048` or there should be a pointer there that points to the `093B6048` value
it says `"processname.exe"+005CEAB4 -> 093B6048`, how would I actually get `093B6048`? I tried adding the "processname.exe" address to `005CEAB4`, I tried getting what "processname.exe" points to and adding it to `005CEAB4`, and I've tried getting what `005CEAB4` points to and adding it to both what "processname.exe" points to and it's actual address and then reading what that is, but none of them get me `093B6048`.
in cheat engine
I'm just confused on this one part
i've given all of the static pointers I've found their own names based on what properties I've been using from the object the pointer points to
again, it depends on which address you're talking about specifically. a lot of it was found from string refs to gain a background while I was still considering whether or not a multiplayer mod was plausible, and then the things that I've needed to add since then that are more specific have been from values that I've searched for and debugged from cheat engine
<@88415148867358720> what did you use to find the addresses?
although I just code inject into the player creation function to get the pointer* of the local player and any subsequent player that gets spawned
I see
there is a player manager vector that can be obtained from a pointer that can be used to get the pointer to the player object consistently
there are plenty of static pointers, not for the player though because that is dynamic due to the presence of coop
I tried finding static pointer addresses but they dont work at all
depends on the address you're talking about
many methods
how did you get the addresses in the first place though
<@231599836183527427> working on a multiplayer mod
huh
everything else is basic read/write from player object memory
not nearly as elegant as remote calls, but 1000x easier
instead of calling the function to spawn the player myself, I have to use a codecave and wait for the game thread to spawn the player itself because when I tried calling the function remotely the graphics weren't loading correctly
my methods for replicating player input and spawning/despawning players are pretty hacky
<@128874748041101312> there are no plans to make it open source while it is being developed atm but I think I *might* release the source when I'm mostly finished with it
thanks
Alright
portal please go

"All types of hearts are transformed into Blue Flies"
https://i.gyazo.com/3f0cba3d8ed23e9ab6b79f6cbe9da367.png lol
or can they just not be picked up
do eternal hearts not spawn with the keeper?
yeah could be
or a "just incase this somehow happens"
might have just been an oversight
Thanks
just tried setting hearts/heart containers to 0 with only eternal heart bool as true and it doesn't appear at all
<@196449185044627468> that looks fantastic
from what I've tried in memory I don't think it shows up at all <@162117085428842496>

no we don't
we do
yall need yiffus
they do
I thought eternal hearts went on the right side of the hearts
if you take a 3 heart spirt heart deal as blue baby with a eternal heart
actually i think it does
it doesnt
in what case would this show up in-game? https://i.gyazo.com/65568a0e461069545f3ab5416f9692d6.png
godspeed w/ dat
and even less for ab+
i like how edmund did basically nothing for afterbirth
Except pixellated and stuff
Next big task: replacing edmund on the startup animation with this
now he understands
just work on what is important
it looks GREAT
I could make it transparent but it would be extra work
interesting
someone posted a ui_hearts image here so I took all of the hearts from there and they all have the shadow bits
don't distract him from his divine task
eh, you don't need that much of a shadow imo
you'd agree with me
i can't see it on my phone so i can't say
don't be sweating it
they're primo, brother
do the hearts look okay with the shadow or am i being overly picky
if that was actually the intention witht he pink checkerboard then I missed it until jack mentioned it
https://i.gyazo.com/4555b245efba6d602f19458f5e09f456.png
shit ive had that idea before tbh
but more because it just refused to load assets I had half the time than because I actually didn't have them
heh I've been down that road
it's great
the missingno sprite is triggering my gmod-without-css ptsd
ooo
neat
not bad
Cool. So, I basically touch up sprites and animations. Just kinda using this as a basic introduction to game development and such
alright I'll share credit with something that ambitious
and my multiplayer mod <:isaac_troll:245063314697093121>
these days, basically all anybody talks about is the spooking of isaac
yes
So, this is where we put various mods or changes?
well shit close enough
oh
sorry didn't mean to confuse anyone
my mod ab+, which adds a + to regular ab
fuck i got hyped
oh
in a parallel universe
did it actually release
nicalis brainwash confirmed
"after ab+ released"
early on after ab+ released
maybe it was a fever dream but I'm pretty sure I remember having a half coin heart as keeper at some point
https://i.gyazo.com/c54041580968f5b43e349818f5940152.png
I don't remember who was telling me that the guppy's collar could result in half a coin heart on the keeper, but at the very least it is possible through editing memory. I'm going to add it to my UI in case there is some glitch that causes half a coin heart to show up.

always welcome to make one

I don't think there are any yet
I can't find any mods based on DC Comics on moddingofisaac, are there none there or none at all?

well duh
You really live up to the penis kin title
let nothing stand in your way

that's gonna be an ab+ item
that's a must

you start with the "spear" of destiny
the boner of isaac

you just swore that you'd mod it
that's portal's fantasy
that's not a mod
what
I'll make sure it's the most popular mod once you make it
futanari penis humiliation hentai
we're gonna have to put this boner to the test
you die
and when it shrinks to nothing
and irl
anything you do shrinks it in game
no
it shrinks if you pull off sick combos
but that's easier
it shrinks
no
and the boner grows when you increase any stat
yes
yeah a big ghost boner with a hitbox that kills you if it touches anything
are you going to give the lost a ghost erection or something
you'll have to work fast
one of my first test mods will be adding a new character called "lost 2 but harder"
I think one of my first test mods will be making curses fun and challenging gameplay modifiers rather than inane annoyances
that's for aferberts tho
you made the aferberts music expansion
I actually made a personal mod for Rebirth that swaps out for Afterbirth tracks.
Yeah
i much prefer it to the rebirth tracks
ab music is pretty good too
it's not bad
ye it is
? music is great
it's a fucking recolor
pulso profundum is the only reason why dank depths feels like an actual floor
you can multiply or divide any bpm by 2 if you really want
no songs below 300 BPM
ye ab music is great
the binding of isaac should have a death metal soundtrack
Afterbirth music was good tho
Rebirth soundtrack was too ambient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMaDSkUb9Qc
upvotes to the left
unpopular opinion: dae le flash soundtrack better
rebirth's is good but it's not really catchy or fun or anything
Why?
Afterbirth+? It's the "definitive" version and about as good as Community Remix.
I generally always preferred original isaac soundtrack
i could help if it involves sprites, anything else nah ?
So it was fine.
Thing is, Community Remix was made as a holdover during Rebirth development.
i didn't think sacrificial could be butchered this badly
basement music was fucking shit tho
community remix was kinda fun
a big community gala where all proceeds go to the nicalis charity
Afterbirth+ feels like community remix tbh
ass key
No u

I don't mod
Why you telling me?
No
come on, do it
No because I'm going to school
someone should make an ASCII room compiler
shame nothing similiar ever came out for rebirth
man community remix was great
community mishmash
Community Remix?
?
Back in my day all we had was TBOI Community Mashup
maybe we'll all be surprised and the lua will be just about anything we could have asked for
anyway it's all just a thought for now
sure, you've got a certain old world charm
no i just want to be a toxic PR fuckwad is that fine
I'd want to do backend if I did it
I'm sure you could handle some of the editor apps if you wanted
people could probably donate to members explicitly if they wanted
okay as long as i get 100% of the donations thanks
I'll keep it in mind when the time comes
actually if us hardcore folks ended up making it big with our AB+ work, we could maybe garner enough attention to make work on a modular isaac-type engine worth our time through donations or something
I would have bet on that one
i am being sarcastic
the bidding of izzy
?
the bondage of isabella
I don't know if you're being sarcastic because I heard of it but never looked into it
what an underrated indie gem
like madness of the little emma
how about be more original and make an isaac inspired game
well if anyone ever makes a serious go at it, I'll be there
I was thinking an Isaac reimplementation in another engine.
but which is completely modular instead
i read that as "recoloring AI"
a game where you walk around a bunch of rooms and shoot at little monsters where everything has some simple physics
well yeah that would be a bitch, but I was thinking a game which is based around the isaac engine, not an actual copy
Including current mods
Especially if you were reaching for 1:1 asset compatibility
And XML parsing probably
I've written AI before, isaac enemy ai is simple as hell
Hardest part would be recoding AI.
MIsaac into slime
isaac's actually not a very complicated game
if I weren't busy making my own game I'd be tempted to lead an isaac clone project myself if AB+ lua is very lacking
They may have Spider. But remember, his experience is Actionscript, not hooking an entire Lua API.
including base character stats in the characters xml, allowing you to add to the characters or challenges instead of having to modify them, etc
you know, it would have taken one day of dev hours for them to enable any number of modding features before now
not even a footnote in the credits, so I guess I'm right to be suspicious
I mean they didn't even credit or acknowledge anyone whose item suggestions made it into afterbirth back when they were doing that
they'll either be ready to pay a completely reasonable amount for a good mod or they'll be ready to just forget it and say fuck the community
if they wanted to rip off someone's design and change the sprites then I wouldn't mind them showing themselves for total scumbags, though I'm not saying I'd expect them to go that far
Nothing they can legally do
License it under "all rights reserved"
though code is always tricky to keep rights over
and your code is still technically yours even if it's for their lua interpretation
Also that's true
And item pool editors.
In which case we have Basement Renovator and alternate IDE's.
well sprites aren't made with their tools even if they're for a mod which is
Unless they're super scummy and say anything made with their tools is their property
I'll look over the workshop TOS if that's a thing
Which is why you put it on MoI
regardless of what they come up with, if anything, for mod sharing like steam workshop, I'm still going to be putting my shit on the TMOI site
they can do what they want if you agree to a TOS
fuck yeah
You HAVE to put it on MoI though or you have no power over them.
$20 for Isaac character editor
Yes
or maybe less cash if it's a simpler mod
if I spend a week or more on a mod and they want to include it, I'm askin for that cash
what teams
so then are we all considering joining #teamfuckyoupayme ?
I imagine you're no worse off
No and you shouldn't
am i supposed to know what paper Isaac is
hence my parenthetical clause
Sucks though
we don't talk about paper isaac
Paper Isaac exists.
that should be a thing
open isaac
oh boy
Yeah
what
and decided to release it for free
if anyone ever started a free isaac clone project (and they knew what the hell they were doing) I'd gladly contribute to that
except they did the sensible thing to do
so basically afterbirth
oh
I never said it should be as powerful as it is, to be fair, to me
The update mostly consists of stuff that was cut from release due to time constraints.
oh man
They did confirm a paid expansion in the works, though.
Supply Drop.
Not an expansion, instead a free content update.
code is a little tricker and they could more easily rip it off though it's still technically illegal
isn't gungeon going to get an expansion pretty soon?
it's clearly a very well developed game
But you're comparing a game with no expansions to one with three
thanks for reminding me what a mistake pre ordering overwatch was
<@153966307593814016> as long as you include your own personal assets, they can't use anything you make unless you upload it somewhere which gives them the rights in the TOS or unless you explicitly give them permission
but the devs deserve every penny of it
Yeah
i still think it's not on par with isaac in terms of replayability
gungeon is a great game
i've only pre-ordered overwatch
Gungeon was worth it.
then they cant impliment it
Afterbirth I regret.
Only things I have ever pre-ordered were Gungeon and Afterbirth.
i'll only distribute my mod via email to people who arent nicalis
unless the devs have proven themselves to be consistently good
yeah
never preorder anything
that sounds reasonable
I haven't got my hopes up for a game except from a dev which has proven themselves time and time again in  years
I've got a loser's cynic attitude when it comes to basically anything game related before it's released
no matter what
they still win
?
in the end they'll still get their money from ab+
The subreddit is pretty much the "general" community and is the vast majority
still the minority though
A lot of us here are intelligent enough to see through their bullshit
well are they underestimating the community, or are they properly judging the bulk of it who gladly eats any shit up
you can't fool everyone with fancy words
not all people are idiots
once again a classic example of edmund and tyrone underestimating their community
that was such a terrible thing for tyrone to say
that means it's def happening
TRUUUUU
nah Tyrone said they can make a new game 11 months ago
it's a shame that we'll need ab+ in order for our mods to be considered legitimately sanctioned by these people
Lua is an interpreted language, and by its very nature there will be limitations.
lol most isaac users would be too afraid to install a mod which does explicitly what they want
Uh, no.
"you can do ANYTHING with Lua!"
Half the subreddit doesn't even know how to mod and it shows
the clueless losers can think what they want and if they make a mod they can let nicalis pick it up and sell it all they like
actual apologist reasonings
Tru xDDDDDD
yes I'd also want to be able to patch it if they added it in
lol it's their game ur modding so it's not your work xdd
To go through MY quality filter and not Nicalis's?
To push updates on MY schedule?
Maybe because I want full control over MY mod?
and if they want my permission it won't be free since they'll be making money off my work
it's all tyrone
The comments I also got were things like "why wouldn't you want your mod merged?"
edmund has no power over niclis any more
well we won't know until the release, but I'm just saying that they can't take one of my sprites and put it in their game legally without at least my permission
if nicilas tries to impliment my mod into the game i'd want a big wad of money for it
their miscommunications are out the fucking roof
^
Edmund says =/= nicalis does
so if I make just one little sprite for my mod, they don't have permission to use it unless they ask
at all costs
avoid getting legally bound to them
judging from how nicalis handled things so far
Thus you can mess them up if they try to take it
well the thing is, edmund said they would be 'checking reddit' or whatever, which implies it won't just be a service which includes permission in the TOS
Thus you're not entering a legally binding contract
that sounds like a good plan
Moddingofisaac.com will probably still be around to just stay away from any licensing Nicalis will try to do in the workshop
implying nicalis will ask for permission lol
I wouldn't charge players for it but if they're going to be making a profit directly off my work then I'm going to ask for compensation
toriel milf
Yes
at the very least
you should
I was thinking earlier, and I'm considering that if I make a really good mod and nicalis asks for permission expecting me to be overjoyed at the validation, I might ask them for a couple hundo
how can they even judge other people's content?
And pokey mans and backasswards are real challenge names
if their own content can't even be on par with the game
especially when pokego is an official item in the game
Dammit robobaby
^^^^
poor coffe in the pc
but i absolutely do not trust nicalis to properly filter content
^
see, the whole "we're gonna add your mods into the game" thing sounds good on paper
I used to be more critical of isaac than I am now, but when I heard that isaac is inspired by Magic and how stupid broken builds and complete dumb luck is actually supposed to be a big part of it, I reasoned that I guess lots of people consider that to be more fun and interesting than a consistent fair challenge
nope
afterbirth+ isn't looking very good at all
and judging from the blog posts so far
The comments were all "stop being negative" or "but you can do LITERALLY ANYTHING with modding"
I'm a bad influence on you kilburn you're being negative
I made a comment on the last Afterbirth+ update post. It is now top when you sort my posts by controversial.
but they were all overshadowed by horrendous game design decisions
afterbirth had a few good things
you gotta be in serious denial if you think afterbirth is great and afterbirth+ is also going to be great
i don't want to be negative nancy here but
all of the above tbh
denying how poorly nicalis has handled many aspects, denying that it's a very unbalanced, capricious design?
I probably won't disagree but I want to know what you mean
but which part is the denial specifically?
also undertail is hot fuck you knowmizu
/r/bindingofisaac
what is the denialbase?
undertale fanbase > isaac denialbase
Yeah but never type undertail
Yeah Undertale is a good game with a cancer fan base
but idk if that's technically a mod
I was involved in the original popular custom server software for creative mode
it added a sickle to the game
i made a minecraft mod once
I liked undertale but not so much that I want to get any of its fandom on me
Good
that's something I'm not interested in participating in
Custom battles via Lua scripting
Undertale engine in Unity
I don't know what that is
because unitale is about as bad if not worse on a resume
unitale?
well actualy I made a reskin once
besides minecraft
I mod any damn thing I can, can't help myself
don't taint your resume with minecraft
might try that again eventually
Tried making minecraft mods years ago but I was like "screw it I suck at this"
Isaac is the first game I've really gotten in to making mods for
not much
what have alla yall modded or made shit for besides isaac?
a tragedy like no other
meanwhile I was on holiday and never did the afterbirth music for isek
Everything else I can avoid pretty easily
Unfortunately removing gore from scarred womb means turning off the flooded caves water, too
¯\_(?)_/¯
it was on a holiday where i had nothing else to do
o
i actually removed blood from the enemy sprites and stuff
I mean you'd have to edit a lot of the sprites but a preliminary gore reducing mod is pretty easy to make
just replace the gibs xml lines with 0's all accross
turns out they didnt give a shit and i never needed it
i actually still have a gore-reducing mod i made for my niece/nephew a year ago
I've never seen that before in my life
anyone remember this
I'm curious about the solution
alright I replied anyway
yeah I haven't done it but I imagined
if u did try and open the game without resourcesi t would just insta crash
wait no
hmmm
!!!
who says they have tried to open the game
I imagine they would have noticed the game doesn't work if it were actually gone
reinstall the game if theyre having an actual problem
that would be my first guess
idk
uh
either that or
maybe the folder is just hidden
I'd help him if he were here but I don't want to go back and forth on the board trying to figure out what he's overlooking and how
maybe he has his eyes closed
he should use "simple mod loader" to install the mods, if he has troubles operating a pc properly
tell him to take pic of directory
delete steam
also this dude needs help http://steamcommunity.com/groups/moddingofisaac/discussions/4/224446945209022658/
binding of isaac: bible studies edition
download tale of samuel
im not talented enough
there isnt one
you shoot presents
where instead of tears
binding of isaac for kids
someone make
hmm
also i hope the womb doesnt trigger her
removing the actual gibs is hella easy but like half the enemies in the game are based around bodily fluids and light gore
http://steamcommunity.com/groups/moddingofisaac/discussions/4/224446614471197533/
pretty good suggestion here if anyone wants to do it:

Too many fancy words
It is fashionable to copulate with small flying invertibrates under the scientific classification of anthophila
Bee?
I dont test mods with less than ? trojans

i don't test mods with less than 100,000 trojans
I don't test mods with more than 100 trojans

Anyone willing to test my mod out?
Gg

time to start work on a mod which adds a super envy to every room
any time
thanks ?
alright upvoted
both
which one
i left a positive comment upvote me ?
spooking of isaac is one of the greatest GOAT GOTY of the year EVER
maybe you shouldve actually finished your fucking randomizer you assface
Isaac randomizer ripoff
spooking of isaac sucks
I will burn him alive
what's this passive aggressive shit
http://puu.sh/sh1yg/913a39989c.png
bullshit
anyways poll time
paid shill
oh
What
Huh
what
thank you  <@!188812728981258245>
o cool i got free shills
you never know what you're gonna get!
yes but they're not randomly chosen
Yeah, but the enemies already get harder each chapter.
a lot of complicated shit which was a pain in the ass really
it randomly selects a certain number of enemies and then fills out all the spawn slots based on difficulty tables I wrote
no I just put in the numbers so it gets harder each chapter
Wait, so the more powerful you are, the more enemies there are?
Now that I think about it it'd just be a boi mod for the boi:r
I mean I wrote a procedural enemy populator
I think I did as well as I could without resorting to utter bullshit
make Isaac difficult again
my mod is about making the game difficult again and soul hearts make the game way easy as hell
that's a gimmick but it's functionally important
8/8
get rekt m8
Like you did with your BS no soul hearts?
you could always just do some hilarious gimmick too
Boi someone needs to make a sprite pack but its community made (profanity filter etc) but that's a lot of emails....
eh, using basement renovator is pretty easy
You can make gameplay mods, but those are so hard to make good.
I'm terrible at art, but it's the easiest way to make a good mod.
I can do good sprite work but I work too slow on art
I'll probably want an artist to help out
Problem is... I don't have afterbirth so it wouldn't be as ~~infamous~~ famous
I'm gonna be making a whole game mode for ab+ if it's possible
Ehhh, I like doing different stuff, since doing a lot of one thing gets really boring.
why not do actually good ones as practice to get ready for ab+
if you're going to do a lot of sprite work reskins one at a time over a long period of time
Give me the coins sprite sheets
Consumables
Trinkets etc
Items first
Of course it's not gonna be all at once...
uncouth
gay
or just set the costumes priority to 99 like me ?
basically you'd barely survive
If you want to do a good reskin too, you have to do allll of the costumes.
¯\_(?)_/¯
godspeed
I can ask for help
gotta go jerk off
Huh
Yea...
Yep, characters are a pain in the ass to reskin.
W o o o o w
Wow, fast.

The lost
Gaper is easy.
Gaper?
Oh wew

Not widow though
the tools
Try all big spider
they're on the tmoi subreddit
Just get Rick's Unpacker.
which sprite sheets?
Yeah.
But you can use Basement Renovator.
<@!159492166542950401> get rick's afterbirth unpacker and chronometrics' basement renovator
Show me 5% of the sprite sheets?
Yeah, it's much easier than recoding gameplay because xml's are a pain in the ass.
simple ones but the process isn't a big deal
well I've done a few
Reskins are harder than most people think.
it can be tedious though yeah
Well, each spritesheet has many sprites, so it will take a while to do each thing.
it's not hard to do reskins
Binning of isek is best mod
Nope.
<@!159492166542950401> Have you made any mods before?
But then if I am doing every item...  I'd say I spent like 1:30 mins on each sprite or something
just cause it's you ?
if you did it all the way, I'd download it
<@!182509747835109387> I'm willing to do it though
<@!159492166542950401> the bining of isek already pretty much does that.
what a fetid turd, what a dollop of rancid cum
what a cocksucker
Ahaha
oh it was that guy
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2467/the-binding-of-legends
for the dozens of hours it would take in order to make such a shitty stupid joke
if you did that you would have my respect
Ahahahaha
What if I made an SM Paint mod, where I make every sprite a recreation in MS paint, but then use a paint software to make it PNG
which one is it?
I knew it
Yes, his mod sucks.
I bet it's not even true when he says it
<@!159492166542950401> The person was criticizing <@145740433165647873> for commenting on his own mod, then did it right afterwards.
this chump's biting my style!
Ok and?
Look at the comments and the dates.
Hmm?

https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2418/the-binding-of-steven
Thanks for the referels
too many people downloading isaac character editor
<@&206619116528861186>
I have no clue.
god WHY uis the modding of isaac dot com website so fucking slow lately
good times
I remember crushing that mod on the featured slot like strangling an infant in the crib
(not a sponsor)
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2418/the-binding-of-steven
that's weird
nah he appears every once in a while
i remember on the lisa sever someone was like "appa canker commented on ur video hes my favorite youtuber
I think it's a nonissue
good
I've never seen that fellow around here
<#227892477162553344> is as dead as cankers youtube channel
Demons don't have Canker.
for the <#227892564513128458> chat that everyone goes to
join the demons
pretty name color
But seriously does anyone have a reason why i should join either angels or demons?
you're too small minded to understand the shitting of isaac
sounds p hot
you can xd my poopy anyday
lol
lol
xdpoopy
I know robo-baby is a savage
robobaby would never turn on me
because lol poop XD
What's so good about the mod? It's just changing all the rock id's to poop id's.
Please.
implying robo baby isnt being sarcastic
I'll give myself an okay
<@145740433165647873> dude robo-baby just complimented you you gotta respond
<@145740433165647873> I know im joking
Great
<@188812728981258245> dude I think I knew it was real
rip
<@145740433165647873> I TOLD YOU IT WAS REAL
sad
Binding of Isaac Rule 34 is cancelled because it was too hard to put penises on the characters.
https://youtu.be/MFsL91qJd64?t=5m55s
oh ok
if FUCKING ROBOBABY says okay to downloading my braincells you obviously should too
I know

not true, spooking of isaac is made by some melonteeth fella
it's okay to shill your mod if you do it ironically
I know
The joke is that everyone is advertising their own mods.
I'd agree if it were released and working well
<@!182509747835109387> Your point is?
multiplayer mod best mod
sounds like a fun time
that's actual hell
yes
like, actually every--
^
download all the mods at once and install them in a random order
it's called literally making everything eye piercing colors
<@188812728981258245> That isn't even your mod.
<@!173420370773147649> stop having paid shills
it takes a real genius to make things somewhat shittier

when you learn god has literally nothing to do with god mode

i see why isaac character editor is too complex for you
lmfao
>arguement
even robo baby is tired of your shit

I wonder if you can buy latex molds of celebrities' feet
you're not funny.
oh

When the foot job is tempting but you know they wont give it to you
such cancer comments
Foot jobs memes are so overused. Kappa
wow i just went on your mod page, and my condolenses
K
>foot job meme
die
yet you're making a fucking fedora and foot job meme
attack helecoptiert XD
good meme m'sir ?
you say that
_tips fedora_
so original
epic meme, for sure
wow havent heard this one before
"lol i indentify as <nonsense/> XDDD"
you're not funny
o
o
I'm foussey tube now
you're not funny.
portal chan wouldn't foot u off in a million years
how do i use the mod ?
<:sad_onion:230800772315611137>
im a trigender pyrofox demiqueer from the 6th dimension
no i have no intents of doing something sexual with a moron like you
<#207259602969034753> ???
<@206245579922210816> Triggered
how dare you misgender me
did you just call me a "u"
<@!182509747835109387> Its when they give you a handjob but with feet
Oh.
i jerk u off with my feet
I'm not into feet but anything feels good on a dick
Do you suck on someone's foot?
dont google it
best meme
What the heck is a footjob?
make it a toejob
foot festish
Once again
wow
Ok were going to that now
slightly tempting
if you press enter, it sets the items
i can give a footjob if you use isaac character editor
how
its fuckign annoying to figure out wether or not your item was set
which one gives you a back rub when you use it
wow i cant remember what pentagrams sprite looks like
lol
wow so hard to type int he proper names of items
Ok
custom challenge actually auto corrects item names and shows you the icon and it is simple and obvious on how to list them
can challenge editor do that? thought so.
^
smh
she clearly shows you how to make chainmail
<@162156525337575425> I know. It was a joke.
instructions are for feckless buffoons
me not having instructions is a meme
what
you cant figure that shit out with that kind of thing
<@162156525337575425> At least custom challenge creator has instructions.
do you press enter then delete and then type a new one?
have to side with <@162156525337575425> but only slightly
of course.
yes
do you seperate them with commas?
"press enter to set items"
That Placenta
cant compete tbh

Jesus

<@!123759574963453954> you found <:sad_onion:230800772315611137> !!!!!

AB+ modded item: gives damage according to the phase of the moon irl
"u figure it out lol"
one just sais
one auto corrects items
who prefers a new moon anyway
that doesn't really matter if one doesnt tell you how to list the fucking items
whats the thought process
honestly how did he fuck up placentas sprite so badly for this
actually one looks god awful and another has a very pretty ui ;^)
bad icon = no buy
actually one doesnt edit challenges you just make challenges by changing a character
no dumbass*
"savage"
i know nothing about the challenge launcher but the icon looks like utter shit for  it
one edits characters, other edits challenges
savage
one is better
they do the same thing
different editors for different purposes
k
internalized oppresion
custom challenge is better than character editor
hi?
hey <@162156525337575425>
ya mon
Neat o

or at least it can, maybe it's chance based
it makes golden poops
<@145740433165647873> wait Midas touch + ecoli make real golden poops? Or just yellow versions of poop enemies?
cover every item in heaps of shit
surprise shit
Surprise bombs
shiny

Sparkly

work that booty
Thicccc
oh

it needs to sparkle
pink turd
Awwww
desu

Use the warp tool to makes mega greed's booty thicker
Assign
PINK

Do a slight green brownish
Blood poop
<@145740433165647873> but then all items could just be experimental treatment
would be different every time
probably could just make a program to swap the locations and names of most of the files with the same image sizes around
Oh
It is sperm, duh.
~~totally not KKK~~
Aaaaawwew

all em
All eden sprites wew
Eden
Eve
Alllll sprites?
someone should make a mod which swaps all the sprites of everything in the game around
***white***
White
Green, yellow, white, red
nothin wrong with that
Robo-Baby agrees.
Yeah
Good.
What if I just made a visual mod that makes different colored poops
same

what do I do with this bullshit
got my fourth item today
Riiip
M S doesn't support PNG
I don't think that's possible in any traditional way
What if a mod just adds secret seeds?
haven't used ms paint in a while but it might give you trouble with transparencies
?
Cockfite
Seed?
????
**MS.Paint**
they're both free
paint.net
but then just use gimp or some image editor
you still need gibbed's unpacker
What if I instead make a visual mod first, start with the little things
Uuhhhh... <:ThinkingP:235495982870036481>

<@162156525337575425> you made character editor?
but it's so easy to edit characters manually
pffffft
godmode stole my #1 spot :(((
download tale of samuel
download isaac character editor
yeah
sounds like I can continue to give it a pass
atleast a few of em
sorta they fire more attacks and have more hp
make the backgrounds actual static
innovatively shit
uh
are all the enemies just reskins?
what's the most innovative thing it does?
gameplay is fighting things with extra hp for no reason
the graphics are awful, but has a few coolish enemies
Hello everybody! It's me, DreamOfNightmares, and I decided that I'm going to start revealing the lore behind almost everything in Godmode, which is located here. These posts will probably all be pretty long, as they're all gonna talk about numerous things at once. And please note that this is kind of hard for me to talk about some parts, so please don't be too hard on me :3
I always guessed that something that big with that many contributors would probably suck

REMOVE GODMODE
big mood
goodmood font
its special
but this is godmode font
yeah
please download
kek already had that shit taken care of
isaac character editor uses these
heres the font
i
appa it is so beautiful
every floor
2 hearts damage
you take
if you dont have any red hearts
but
so now if you want names like this in your mod u can have them
fire rate + damage up
^
pretty sure
in fact it's slightly better if you have no red hearts
uuh
item
oh
can you
yeah
that doesn't really do it
you can use that without red hearts tho
crown of light
u mean
i made a font to replicate the beautiful godmode vs screen names
that's why I mostly removed them in my mod
yeah soul hearts really imbalance the fuck out of the game once you're good at it and know how to get them
or tears or whatever
like the more heart containers you have, the more damage you get
i want to see items that incentivise keeping red hearts
+damage, but you must take a pill every floor to keep the damage
so annoying
I just don't want to fucking deal with amnesia and shit
or get a damage down
I never take pills unless I get phd or I see 3+ of the same pill at once
or u take damage
floor or smthn
i want the addiced pill to force you to take a pill every like
removes all 3 good pills
no more fucking around, just give it to me straight
yeah I agree pills are awful, that's the inspiration
afterbirth DLC
>item which makes all pills bad
I always thought there should be an item which makes all pills bad but gives you a small random stat boost every time you use one
or maybe
+50% to all stats but you can no longer use cards, runes or pills
besides a little bit of experimenting to see how shit works, I really want to go full hardcore and make a whole new game mode immediately
i want items that are good but also hinder you
<@145740433165647873> that actually sounds fun
stfu robo shitlord
**NOT THAT I KNOW OF**
I want to make an AB+ mod which replaces all the items in the game with items that have small upsides and huge downsides
yes
oh, you mean like Brimstone as The Keeper?
balance
i want an item that instantly kills you
yeah boy
that is absolutely awful
I want an item which gives you 10% more damage but hurts you every time you touch a pickup
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvQOESpUkAAdsXo.png
nice
damage up
instead of
gave you keys and shit
I want a trinket that turns all rocks into bomb rocks
honestly i'd rather have an item that just
nice
nice
Yes
that's pretty metal
and no passive
-1/-1/-1
libra
so it's
+5% off
This is a new Binding of Avalice Item! +5! It may replace Boom, but it grants +5 coins, bombs, and keys!

109 memes
OH that one
http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Greed_Machine
wew
its called greed machine in my heart ok
and they're...well, them, so i doubt they'd manipulate the pic
donations
"greed machine"
yeah but this was a screenshot
i mean the sub was tricked into thinking that getting greed machine to 1000 gives you another keeper coin
i recall seeing on the sub a screenshot with half a coin heart
weird
<@115897582378680329> according to the wiki, it results in half a soul heart rather than half a coin heart
<@159492166542950401> by the default behavior, that would only happen if you are playing with assholes. cooperation is necessary. someone doing that would just jeopardize the run anyways, because as per the default behavior if someone dies then the run is over for everyone. but, again, this is all *default* behavior that could be customized so that players can respawn or items are shared or each player gets their own item room.
thanks <@115897582378680329>
<@88415148867358720> everyone with highest speed takes all items
also guppy's collar is i think the only way keeper can get half a coin. it's functionally identical to 1 coin though.
need/greed system?
... maybe even a need/greed system
that sounds fantastic
I'm going to allow for a lot of game customization so that people can play multiplayer how they want
The default behavior will be that players get their own items, none of the items are shared, however I could add an option to share items in the future
<@88415148867358720> when people get an item is it shared?
is it dumb? sure as hell so
why? no fucking clue
guppy's collar appearently does it'
its possible actually
nicalis.
In a word...
also does anybody know why there is a sprite for a half coin heart for the keeper, yet it's impossible to have half of a coin heart?
<@159492166542950401> what do you mean?
How would items work?
No
don't you wish everyone made games like Nicalis
lol
That's because Nicalis in their infinite wisdom put a sleep(1) in windowed mode
i guess I'll have to do that
the delay comes from fps lag when I tab out of one of the games, although that could be fixed by replicating the timer on the bomb...
<@167363485326508033> <@66197463593136128> https://i.gyazo.com/92e71f3b6dcbacd268f60873d85af78b.gif
i'm probably going to have to simulate inputs for everything but movement
but that is a sacrifice im willing to make, also I guess protection could be put in place if necessary
it was a lot easier to just replicate position changes, although that will be hackable like through speed hacks or straight up teleportation around the room
well I actually tried doing it for movement but it was not accurate enough, and in the presence of latency the errors would compound themselves until the position was completely off
if you're already doing it for tears
why not simulate inputs for everything?
RIP
damn
nope
<@167363485326508033> about to work on bomb placement, is there an easy bool I can write to that if true causes the player to place a bomb? or am I going to have to do something more hacky with psuedo-inputs like for tears
<:troll_bomb:230143860813201408>
shit, you're right. <#205854501083545601>
are we still talking about modding
and the community acting like self entitled children is not helping obviously
console contracts are a mess, and it's 2 programmers, both of which are horrible at programming, one has atrocious spaghetti code, and the other burnt out very soon
i mean its to be expectedc
Oh yeah nuclear throne release
and holy shit that's respect worthy
I used to respect Vlambeer(the guys behind Nuclear Throne), and I still do. But while they made a great game, release was such a huge fuckup for so many reasons.
They actually brought a robocraft veteran on the dev team because the devs actually were so selfless they admitted they were new to the genre, are inexperienced, and need help from someone who knows the genre inside and out
All the vets left and moved to Galactic Junk League. Those devs I really respect.
every company has their fuckups, but these are some big ones, damn.
<:poo:230363864724799488>
Loot crates, your SOLE reward for finishing a match now, that gives you RANDOM PARTS in a game that is supposed to be about creativity.
ugh
And the final nail in the coffin... loot crates.
Adding massive, oversized weapons saying "it's okay because we're flattening tiers" then removing tiers like they said they would then continuing on to make smaller versions of the weapons anyways.
Removing the pilot seat, meaning there was no "core" to defend. More strategy being thrown out the window.
Removing megabots, a key part of the game.
Uncalled for buffs and nerfs.
Bu tthen they made a lot of questionable decisions.
They slowly added a more MOBA-esque gamemode, which I was okay with, it had much more strategy than the normal TDM.
In terms of Robocraft, when it first came out it had tons and tons of potential. It was a game where you could build pretty much anything imaginable and send it in a pretty well built map to have it fight against other enemies.
They're so good they provide patch notes :LUL:
Yeah
but hey, at least their games are overall complete, and function much better than Nicalis'
Klei's fuckups are more similar to having a bug that happens to be an amazing feature that adds depth, and then fixing it. its a big complaint with don't starve together(who's endgame, thanks to that, is in an arguably worse situation than the normal game. it's not bad by any means, but it lacks the depth the og had), and with them starting to patch out ds once again(or rather its new-ish dlc), there's a good fear of them doing another such thing(they sort of started).
*robocraft flashbacks*
devs doing fuckups
it's a great game. i'm a pretty big fan of it. the devs do occasional fuckups but nothing even remotely close to nicalis
I got gifted it by one of my friends, but haven't gotten around to modding it, or playing it that much in general
As you can see by the example, it's enough to create pretty much something new entirely.
Don't Starve has pretty good modding support from what I hear
meanwhile, in say, Don't Starve, someone iS FUCKING MODDING IT INTO A FIGHTING GAME ALA SUPER SMASH BROS. We're nowhere near asking for that level, but I doubt Nicalis would even let us be able to do something meaningful
its so stupid
like how in entities2 there are spawn enemy on death commands but they're still hardcoded in the engine so you can't put that on other entities
I still fail to understand why a lot of the XML's are hardcoded
¯\_(?)_/¯
or rather, why does that chunk have no clue on how modding actually works for actually moddable games
ok but the idiots who are excited over being able to create reskins. why are they such a good chunk of the fanbase
Yeah, but what we can do at most is what worries me.
yeah their attitude is one of the worst parts about them
lua support would mean we can do significiantly more at least
Can't stand Nicalis's attitude so far, especially their "yeah the dlc is shit but you can fix it with OUR MOD API xDDDDDDDD"
not that AB+ will be any better
true
quite an exaggeration for what we can do in isaac tbh
"modding"
modding is super easy tbh
hopefully
I'm learning to be an exe mod wizard
A lot of us here understand it decently well, and some of us are modding wizards, and others (read: one, maybe two people) still are EXE mod wizards
<@206245579922210816> you probably just can't figure it out
you can't literally do nothing therefore it is impossible
nothing is impossible
what
i cant figure this out
or im just stupid
it is literally impossible to mod
harsh, but I guess sometimes you've gotta be
I bet <@246712577307049984> 's mod doesn't even rock
finally my mod has been endorsed by notch himself

MY MOD ROCKS !!!!!
put a fly near it
make it poopier
<@153966307593814016> it already is a brown crystal
had a penny in it
<:penny_pickup:230143734526771210>
Is it hot? or cold?
monstro shit
Animal shit? or human?
crystalized shit
But gay
GENIUS
brown crystal
just make butt penny look like a
Ikr
I just use trackpad and a kindof crap drawing app
I wish I had a drawing pad and drawing software
Crystal key even, but it's up to you they look really good
<@173206704849158144> could try making the butt penny look like a Crystal poop (butt then it might mislead)
?
Looks a bit better
(there are small ashes around it.)
New Burnt Gem
Fair enough
Burnt could have some ashes around it
I feel like you could make Burnt and Butt Gem look a bit more different
In order: Swallowed Gem, Butt Gem, Burnt Gem, Flat Gem, Counterfeit Gem




Did some sprites for these new Trinkets
Counterfeit Gem: "Cubic Zirconium!"
Burnt Gem: "Doesn't look as pretty."
Flat Gem: "It's a miracle this thing didn't shatter."
Butt Gem: "Disgusting!"
Swallowed Gem: "Probably tore up some poor soul's esophagus."
Wood Shield: "Crystals to Hearts!" (this is to reflect the *actual* property of the Wood Shield in Freedom Planet. In fact, every single shield will be a Trinket)
<@173206704849158144> it could be a blue-transparent plastic looking gem that has a part of another gem stuck on it
<@159492166542950401> No, EXE mod.
...Holy shit that's actually a pretty neat idea
counterfeit gem
Gem Hoarder. Replaces A Dollar. "You are absolutely insane. +99 Crystals."
Will it come with free rebirth?
Wait like online?
U Wot?
Just checking.
Alright
no
Is BoI: Together even remotely stable yet?
Alright, you horny fucks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwG5dYI4hM&feature=youtu.be  is this  music layer ok? its really, really lazy
So it might be hardcoded?
who knows, the golden bomb sound is the same sound as the spacebar item charge sound slowed down
It doesn't sound reused.
no clue, may be a reused sound
Not sure
iirc those are packed with the file that contains keeper?
<@147076393937797121> <@66197463593136128>
<@162117085428842496> Do you know where the sound effect for the coin tears is located?
rude
no shit sherlock
i made a thing i guess
http://i.imgur.com/6fNJXHY.png
Some things that are in the XML can't be changed, even if it looks like they can be.
Yeah, well, it's Nicalis.
Weird, it seems like it would be with how the xml files look
nope
(Ex. make it so that doesn't happen, so item pickup sounds aren't used in the isaac fight)
Is it possible to add new sounds?
<@234312332107317248> There are many. And some of them are being used in the Isaac boss fight.
whats the file name for the "i got an item" sound effect?
?

Messing with the sprites
First  time modding  this  game
Hey guys
oh, thanks
its in afterbirth.a
im trying to replace the flooded caves music and i cant find it anywhere. can you even replace it?
I'm currently unable to take screenshots of my mod. Would someone be so kind and provide me with a few? I'll credit you on the mod page. Thanks a lot!
wow
There's a straight and a skewed one, in case people don't like it skewed.
That's exactly what it is.
Just looks like a skew to me.
Different styles?
Two different styles.
why are there 2
I changed the hearts to an health bar.
2
why
what's the first one
what

I got two sprite sheets done.
...I'm an idiot.
I forgot to rename the file.
That's weird... Isaac doesn't load my sprites...
Great, so installation doesn't change. ?
no thats good. just a gfx folder with ui folder in it and in that the file. finish
I'm only messing with "ui_hearts" so that shouldn't be a problem... I think.
install like rebirth mods, only difference is the installation of anm2 files
Are Afterbirth mods installed just like Rebirth mods or do I have to put them into an "afterbirth" folder like the unpacker does?
Alright, sure. Guess that'll work.
I just got confused by it...
just copy the one you made from the left to the right ?
I guess I'll just leave it empty, then...?
same as the one on the left. i dont know why its duplicated...
I'm a little confused... what's the empty heart on the right then?
And he has luck -2
its like a heart, but instead you have to collect coins instad of hearts to refill them
Oh, I see... haven't unlocked that character yet.
What does it do?
keeper
What are these golden things on the right?
Uh... I have a question...
...and it did. Welp.
Now I hope the file size didn't change...
I think I'll actually update the mod a bit.
don't care
dunno how I broke em
<@174193097285173250> arcades are broken in the current version just so u know
It's a mod which turns the hearts into a health bar. Should probably update it for Afterbirth. https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/453/health-bar
thy <@66197463593136128>

I have my own little mod which I have neglected.
<@174193097285173250> https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/1484/the-tale-of-samuel

low self esteem
ignore appa <@117577267235782661> , he loves hating on his own mods

but I guess
it's kinda edgy and shit and buggy
That's an interesting mod.
ye
<@162117085428842496> that sick "judgement" beatdrop at 0:47 O_O
it also captures the feeling of being underwater perfectly
it really fits
actually. i don't think isaac is that high energy
tru
ur ugly
also I know it's ugly but I don't care
for isaac
calm does not equal bad.

sorry
I didn't see his ping
i was being sarcastic
yeah
nvm
o
no I meant winter was being sarcastic
Really? I don't know a whole lot about the story, so sue me if I say something wrong.
i'll have u know that was just 2 very similar planets
um
<@162117085428842496> Not very good at realizing sarcasm, sorry.
<@117577267235782661>  it was obiously sarcasam
funny how this one missing feature lead to the doom of the whole game ?
<@153966307593814016> Actually... two players went onto the same planet once - and they couldn't see each other.
it's just a very low chance you will ever meet someone u dummy
no man's sky multiplayer is functional
Congratulations <@88415148867358720> , your multiplayer is already more functional than No Man's Sky's
<@88415148867358720> that's amazing.
so it can be more than 2 players
there is no max players limit
<@241383278182006784> it's still a ways off but at the very least players can see each other and fire tears
Yeah he's working on an online multiplayer mod
Wait, <@88415148867358720> is that a 2 players mod?
exactly
but really this shouldn't be an issue at all if the clients hold the fire key in terms of tear syncing
right well i guess i'd imagine this kind of shit happening at high ping
and vice versa, at high ping and high packet loss clients might see enemies randomly take damage
i think that is to be expected with high packet loss and high ping. basically i'm going to propagate all enemy state changes to clients from the host, so basically the host receives input from clients and I feed that into the actual game. if a client hits an enemy but doesn't hit the enemy on the server, then the client will not see the enemy take damage from the tear. at least that is the plan atm
oh if its host based i guess it doesnt really matter if it MAY show a tear going somewhere else
also, hit detection is going to be entirely host based
i'm assuming most players will be holding it often
holding the fire key requires no extra packets
it only happened once with 50% loss and that was without me holding the fire key
... kind of
that would be a problem wouldnt it
you're not mistaken, that did happen in the gif
>100ms there would be issues but I don't see how that could be prevented easily, even with prediction mechanisms in place
not sure if its just me or sometimes a tear goes in a completely different direction
at least, at the moment there are no perceivable issues but I guess they might show later
i'm able to play with others at ~40ms without issue as well
hmmm
50% simulated packet loss on the host only, at least
is this acceptable?
https://i.gyazo.com/101f4e799b161b72e2305dd7d6c140f7.gif
some of you guys ( <@66197463593136128> <@162156525337575425> ) were worried about packet loss and latency being an issue, this is a test with 50% simulated packet loss
ok thanks

<@162156525337575425>  character editor on ouya when
Write "Windows Vista only".
write mac support for isaac character editor
Can confirm what <@174193097285173250> said, unless you specifically tell Macs to be case sensitive it'll work
Ah
<@173206704849158144> you do know that this is a running gag ? every mod is compatible for both mac and windows. linux masterrace is the only one that can have issues because fucking nicalis and its .anm2 files ?

<@!176129305342902272> Depends on what you mean by "how they work."
Anyone know how champions work?
ah yeah true
It just wouldn't work.
But as for the whole tone, where it is more worried about being informative...
For the subject matter, it probably would
i would think energetic music would fit in a FP-themed mod trailer though, but that may just be me
But oh well.
Not even the main theme. WAYYY too energetic
not even the main theme?
That and there's relatively few tracks in FP actually suited for a trailer
I just like Earthbound music. That's it.
As for why I put in Earthbound music...
alright, I changed the background of the trailer

yes

It is the default title.
what does the current one look like?

i could help out with some sprites if you need

I might work on that, but I am not good at detailed sprites.

do i put that gfx folder in the resources folder?
the file i downloaded came with a gfx folder

oohh
all of those files are supposed to go in a gfx folder
also
is the mod up to date with the afterbirth version you have as well?
where did you put it

yes
<@175392549035442177>

do you have afterbirth

i mean <@66197463593136128> shills his fucking music mod on every given opportunity
Shut up.
So was every virus
Does anybody here know anyone who has made a music mod?
I didn't look at the screenshkt lmao
disregard
wair
have you tested pst the title
the titlescreen music is in the afterbirth directory
no clue what could possibly be wrong then
It still plays nothing...
300 mb
i think its 300 mb
i mean complete music overhauls fit so
What is the limit?
the nodding site has a limiti
but
eh fuck it, its 2016 and file sizes dont matter
The mod will take up a lot of space, though, because I want one music file for multiple floors.
or use the same file twice, idk if that'd do anything
and for the layer shit idk, make a completely empty music file?
Ohhh... That will probably work.
do it the same way then? just leave the filenames unchanged and dont bother with music.xml
The music mod I downloaded doesn't even have a music.xml file...
I'm going to download a music mod and see what's wrong.
sublime text
fine
dont listen to these shills
notepad++ is shit
bich
^
notepad++
It is neater than notepad.
why do you use wordpad for xmls tho
just download a random music mod and look at how that does it
dunno

ok I dunno lol
Yes.
not you
Idk
is the music.xml in resources
only other guess is not having the layer fucks it up
welp not sure then
Nope, it doesn't work.
other than that not sure, never done music related things
I'll try it out.
cause in my unpack music is in `resources/music/afterbirth` but im not sure if thats just the afterbirth tracks
Yes.
do you have afterbirth
Yes.
not play at all
does it like
Why doesn't any music play? Are my files in the right places?

Being yup the mod file and dump everything into the second resources
Go into resources, then resources
Then click show file contents
Once you get the file up right click on it should be called Isaac.ng
Click properties then local files I believe?
Go to steam, right click on tboi
once you extract a mod file
You need some sort of .rar extractor I think,
anyone wanna help
if you need to know, i'm using a mac
so i tried finally installing a mod, and i realized that i have no clue how the fuck to do it right
That and the whole "it doesn't look like it's remotely in the same place" kinda thing

Like, easier than Binding of Isaac modding
If you want it, make it yourself. It's surprisingly easy.
Cave story modding exists, ya know?
i just want my cave story prequel damn it
Oh, cool. I think my friend will like that.
I dunno. Wont let me mention.
Also that's pretty good! @koykoy13#7826
It'll release late 2017
<@117577267235782661> https://youtu.be/CHAYtSUfW0c
I thought there's only one game to it.
"Freedom Planet 2" is a thing?
not my best but
<:troll_bomb:230143860813201408> <:angel_baby:230360200199012352>
In between then, I might do some other projects in the modding scene.
And after that, it'll be *almost a whole year* before I do more characters, specifically ones from Freedom Planet 2, for an Afterbirth+ expansion to The Binding of Avalice temporarily called The Binding of Avalice 2 for now.
Neera (the character I showed) will be the last character I will do until Afterbirth+ comes out, by which point I will add 3 more characters.

"school and stuff"
i dont upload the mod, i send my sprites to the creator, but he still didnt have uploaded a new version ^^' school and stuff. but there's still the old version https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/798/the-binding-of-pokemon
I was wondering, ahve you uploaded the mod yet? ?
bout time you answered me :>
<@174630956567756802> oh great! ?
nope!
i think the whole point of that pic is to show that senpai finally noticed him
did you put some cancer hashtags in the tweet
wow
Because I looped "ReGenesis".
Where do BRSTM loops belong to?

Wasn't that guy some creep who animated mlp porn
if veggietales isn't in this mod i'll be mildly disappointed
but Gymnopedie
who needs any rip
no ?
Triple-Q isn't dead?
I forgot something in the previous version
triple q liked her though

mfw
still decided to edit it because I hdont know what to do also
^^
but okay
it wasnt finished
<@174630956567756802> I tried fixing up that nozomi sprite
fan channel. fans send rips and stuff.
Is TTGD a fan channel or do people on his team work on it?
its from isaac normal but there's this on ttgd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGgfBSPmlxk
why tho
https://youtu.be/bUHvgy5BQqQ
There is a high-quality rip of Isaac.
but i pretty muh stopped because there was no rip of isaac
ah? because i did some sprites, as you can see ?
I alone wasnt planning on it
N O
please dont we have enough of those cancer mods
<@130361395978960897> ? are you going to make a siivagunner mod?

I just got stabbed in th lungs
I don't I never said I got lung cancer
i bet you smoke

Cause I punctured both my lungs and this is the only method of breathing
i dstill dont know why you wear a gasmask
I agree with appa... wich I don't do often
low quality icture
Thanks for trying though, Jerbear
alright
im retarded
nvn
ow air
well i did that and it fixed the issue in my mod
that's not the problem
cant you just make it so there isnt an intro to the tilte music
see robo baby gets it
Classic portal ?
The engine does not expect an OGV intro, since the normal intro is anm2. As such, my suspicion is that the engine is set to start the music after the anm2 is done playing. However, since there isn't an anm2, it plays it regardless. Now, the OGV will mute this, so it won't sound until the OGV is over.
Engine limitation.
It's impossible to fix that.
cool beans
sorry i don't speak caps
Like, how to fix the whole issue with the title screen music being pushed backwards by an OGV intro?
BTW, does anyone know how to fix my problem yet?
RIP in riperoni
?
as i know, it is impossible to achieve that. sorry

<@174630956567756802> hey man you still doing the pokemon stuff? ?
I kinda wanna add The Isaac of Isaac: ReIsaac as the intro thing
weird
is what mine is
-<cutscenes root="resources/gfx/cutscenes/">


-<cutscene fadecolor="black" fadeout="true" name="Intro" id="1">

<videopart file="foi_intro.ogv"/>
<@162117085428842496> Here's the Cutscenes.xml code I have for it

¯\_(?)_/¯
It doesn't show the whole intro, but it illustrates the point I was trying to make
I took the intro to Freedom Planet and put it in TBoI
Yes, this is straight up game footage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xArv6WkEKlQ&feature=youtu.be
Like, I'll record footage now
i had no issues when i did that for my mod
what do you mean by pushed backwards
@here I replaced the intro with an OGV cutscene, how do I make it so that the Title Screen music isn't pushed backwards because it isn't an ANM2 anymore?
you can also change a character's starting items
You can also reskin enemies and create new attack variations
?
Well, you can completely edit rooms, add new ones and etc. which does allow for some interesting stuff
either making it harder or easier
but makes it feel different
nothing that actually **affects** gameplay
as far as i know you can only re teaxture existing items change what they give upon pick up (hearts or whatever) and you can change some stuff about rooms
basically you're horribly limited in modding until afterbirth+ comes along
What?
And whether or not it is active or passive
Yeah that too
And active item's charge time?
The best you can do is change how many hearts or collectibles they give
Nope
What about changing what items do?
cri
Not until Afterbirth+
Nope
Is it possible to add like a brand new item with a mod and not replace anything?
Darwinsim causes cancer
Darwin stop pls :>
also, Steve transformation
also, this is Beezlebub's orginal sprite
not sure if i should make this into a offical character, but this is my version of Super Bum

not sure if i showed this yet, but
understandable
as it would be on by default
whore of babylon would be too strong if he started with the same hp as azazel
the mark would work
i think
give him the nail
whore
been thinking of giving him ether The Mark or Hore Of Babylon
i just need to figure out what
well, he will get a item power
only flies
he has the same HP as Azazal, flight and im still working on what he should start with
that's just whore of babylon but mirrored for some reason
he fears the bagger 288
why doesnt beeLZEbub look like a fly though
this is Beezlebub
here's the i think is third flyin character for Rapture
but yea
nah its fine
sorry
cant explain it
i
oops
didnt know what you were doing
you actually
oh
idk, im sorry if im wasting your time <@!153966307593814016>
ugh
did, it says that i need some stupid app for it
touch them with the mouse
i cant open them or anything
well, there just files
oh
for my services
...what
now slip me a small payment of $200
cool

alright, there in
yeah just put them in
gunna post them in the rebirth folder
i copied them, i feel like i gotta place them in the folders or something
you use the extracted files
thanks

now what do i do?
ye
<@!153966307593814016> i think i did it
http://i.imgur.com/lwFdatb.png this good?
it's used for all of the UI stuff, https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205854782542315520/236239715613802496/charactermenu.png
I think it's referenced as TeamMeat
what do you mean by handwritten font cause i might have that
anyone have a ttf of the handwritten font? I can see the images of them, but no compiled font
there all in
alright, putting them in
the files you want to extract
what files do i put in there?
put the files in the extractor
what i do is
yes
<@!153966307593814016> you ever extracted the Rebirth/Afterbirth files and sprites?
hmm, i got a idea
~~funny joke lol~~ each version i gotten is for Rebirth, not Afterbirth
did you try putting the batteries in backwards
i think i have the wrong version
wait, i know the problem i think
im getting nothing
and soon you will get it
extract the files
yes
every time i extract i only get this
click on it
~~im sorry tis is my frist time doing this~~
you open it
<@153966307593814016> how do i run the extractor, i cant find it
he can be only unlocked is by reaching the I AM ERROR room
good
but yea, ERROR's hp i plan to be randomly generated like Eden, and i plan to give him 404 and MissingNo
give undefined
missingno or riot
404 is a lame trinket
giving him items that are glichy
i actaily plan to give him 404
give him missingno
thanks
nice
also
you need to run the extractor
or his full name, I AM ERROR
here he is, Error!
anyway, i finaly got a new character for the Rapture mod!
thx
i kno, i got it to work
you need to extract the files
i got it to work
wait nvm
the only thing that it extracted was the Who Am I part of the main menu
alright, downloaded
you use the one for your version of the game
idk, i just think at least one of these are outdate
What's the difference between those?
witch do i use?
yea there was
i think there was a thing made for that
but how
extract them
here's a rly newby question but how can i get all the sprites from Rebirth/Afterbirth?
I'm assuming this based on exe modding the PC version.
For animation files and the like, but the executable will probably require digging through some low level assembly.
Could easily not be. Just going off of what ive seen so far on the vita version. So far its been a 100% copy and paste job lol
Good luck, though.
I seriously doubt it is that easy.
I'm sure that will make a liar out of me though
<@66197463593136128> noted thanks that part shouldn't be difficult since vita executables are just zip files :p
The afterbirth.a doesn't magically turn rebirth in to Afterbirth, in fact rebirth ignores it
<@190963577681608704> You'd have to mod the executable, though
^ lame
<@92838401044140032> My mod manager used a mitm proxy to obtain userinfomation, then simply parsed the html from the site. If you are interested this is the current state of the code (WARNING: It is midrefactoring and a giant mess). The most important things in there, that you might be able to use, are the C# version of the APi-Binding (yes the site has something resembling an api) and xsd files for rebith's data files (not afterbirth). If you are interessted in using the the api, message me with your moddingofisaac user and I will create app and user-key for you.
looks cool
turned more into learning how WPF animation work, heh
Welp

https://youtu.be/gk32B481ocM
<@145254698696310784> Nice
made this rly edgy mask thing
The game has been a 100% copy and paste from PC so far. Lets see if that trend continues
about to do attemp #1 at porting afterbirth the to psvita..
(I'm not even sure if I'm making a manager, if I am I most likely won't say I am as I don't like getting people's hopes up ? )
know of any resources on parsing the room files? If I could find something like that I could possibly do that
probably a way to merge and override rooms
If there were a mod manager that was kept up(or atleast worked), what would you want in it?
hue
Made by moi
But the DNA Cannon sprite was custom
Serpentine's Blaster was ripped from the actual game
<@129339380090404864>
And the DNA Cannon is a common enemy
Serpentine's Blaster is a blaster wielded by Serpentine, an antagonist in Freedom Planet who serves under Lord Brevon
Freedom Planet
What are these items a reference to?
?
...Wait...
No, it shoots lasers that hit you numerous times again and again, generally being a dick to speedrunners
?
does it shoot sperm ?
DNA Cannon. Lil' Brimstone replacement
Description: "WHOOOOOOOO!!!!!"
Hey I could rename any custom sprite to collectibles_183_toothpicks.png and you'd believe me
`collectibles_183_toothpicks.png` WHO COULDA THOUGHT
nailed it
It is Toothpicks
it's a reskin of toothpicks
that's what i meant
yeah
It just says it's toothpicks
Lol
No that's not toothpicks
pretty good sprite tho
it's toothpicks from the looks of it
What does is do
Serpentine's Blaster is now in The Binding of Avalice!

An item that makes your tears remove godmode every time you fire.
black ok meme
?? meme
salmon trinkets
makes your tears
an item that
no...
an item that turns your tears into monstro
i got an even better idea
it stays in the same place
but
a monstro tear
so like
on an x,y,z
i mean
on a x,y basis
like

and i dont
Oh.
thats the item
thats it
isaac always fires his tears up
new item idea
oh shit
ab+ will be slightly better garbage
if you can make brimstone synergize with continuum in AB+
honestly
mmmmMM
soy milk + ipecac + reverse continuum
ipecac would be amazing
and brimstone
...that's about it
Like with mysterious liquid
It would have great synergies
yes
it makes your tears collide with floors
instead of making your tears travel through walls
where
a reverse continuum
what about
anything is better than lost fly
<:isaac_shoop:231218479607316480>  my life is agony
then again
hey continuum is better than lost fly
the only reason why it looks useful is because it's also a massive range up iirc
continuum sounded good on paper but it's pretty damn useless when you think about it
there, i said it
tbh most of the popular subreddit suggestions are garbage
robobaby on the ball
damn
Sadly
Then we'll put 120+ new items
And we shall compile these in to a new mod for AB+
yes
Every single space bar item but slightly larger as an icon
yes
confirmed
and those are all the new items in AB+
Yes
Big versions of every familiar with "little" in their name.
I've got a bad idea, and you guys are the kind of people who would back it up and make it work.
I believe that it happened, I'm just flabbergasted that it has nonetheless
_but are you fucking kidding me?_
I figured as much
<@123098991742287872> It's little chub but slower and larger
See robo baby gets it
evidently
He doesnt wanna work on this shit anymore
_Big Chub?_
hold the phone
nice
As were the majority of on stream items
<@129339380090404864> Big Chub was confirmed official in a blog post.
i refer to the collection/death icons. those from mods where mega satan icons, the rest had their own
all of the items had icons but im pretty sure big chub was modded in
was big chub a mod or an official item ? i cant remember if it has an icon or not
Big Chub is inexcusable though
Everyone suggests it but when it's official people are like "no"
TBH, yeah
im surprised at the backlash "Goat Head but for angel rooms" got seeing as its been suggested on the subreddit every day for the past two years
?
good one <@66197463593136128>  ? laught hard ?
GOD DAMMIT ROBO BABY I AM NOT AN OBSESSED AB+ FAN
`@jerbear64 found Obsessed Fan`
Editing existing content and to what extent we can add new content
Mhmm
All we know is that we can add new content, but I'm worried about two things.
If we dont have that, we cant do jack
The chance, however, is small.
my one hope for the API is being able to remove content
^^^^^^
the API has a chance of being not shit
No one should hype new content cuz it will be shit 100%
the sad thing is, that most of the normal isaac players dont know what a modding API does, so they hype different things like new items. The problem with that is, that nicalis sees a bunch of people wanting new items instead of API and they focus more on those, instead of an API that could allow the player to create their own ideas. Worst case would be, that we cant do shit with the API and the dlc sucks because lack of modability, therefore lack of new original content.
whoops
<#207259602969034753>
In any case, what Nicalis is calling a modding API and what the player base thinks a modding API is are two drastically different things
Welp, I better get to learning Lua
...that's about it
<@!123098991742287872> well, we know it's Lua
<@!176129305342902272> A modding API is just a fancy way of saying "we can mod the game with Lua now" in this case
But we don't know what it will be, since what we've seen is limited
it means poopy garbage shit that we can already do by now
There's a general consensus of what it should be
Yes we do.
In all honesty, we don't know what AB+ means by modding API
It's an abomination
In addition to having tact, I'm bad at introductions; couldn't you tell?
**is new to modding things**
why thank you >:^3
Speaking of AB+, what exactly is a modding api
desu
b-baka
It's not like I _like_ you or anything
In my eyes, you're like a living legend or somethinf _maybe a little bit I don't know_
yay
Nah, man, everybody's welcome here
We disabled the creature here because he was rebelling against jebus
and <@!176129305342902272> thank
i was just guessing by how you said it, i first pictured it as "ey man, why are you here? this place isnt for you" but i get what your saying
oh
wha
oh no, you didnt
Tact isn't exactly one of my strong suits.
Your picture looks perfect for the last message you said Venuz
Sheesh, is that what it sounded like I was saying?
Oh, that's not it at all
are you saying im not welcome here or anything?
well, i wanted to get back into doing a Binding Of Isaac mod i abandoned a hella long time ago. im sure i can get it to sky rocked out into the game one Afterbirth + comes out
Is there some sort of NT modding community, preferably in the form of a Discord? Seems like a lot of you frequent /r/nuclearthrone
upon further research, I must inquire
/u/doctorvenuz what are you doing here?
ill seriously put these into thinking
i love the ideas yall
k
Yes I do know what you mean, if you know what I mean
oh i screwed after birth too if ya know what I mean
Screw after birth
If you want a badly designed character, take a look at Lazarus. He can revive, because Lazarus revived in the Bible. That's it. He doesn't change the way you play in any way.
Keeper actually makes sense from a gameplay perspective though. Having coins for HP means being able to manipulate situations to your advantage, like sacrifice rooms, while also being relatively difficult to play as and breaking the "meta" of the game (i.e. soul hearts and devil deals galore).
Finished the wooden nickel, it looks shit cause it's shit
He's so bad that one of his unlocks is an item you pretty much are forced to carry to survive
But from a gameplay perspective he is objectively the worst character
Thus, his HP is coins.
He makes sense thematically. He's a shopkeeper. He's consumed by greed.
Take, for example... Keeper.
you should probably focus more on how things work from a gameplay perspective than how much sense they make thematically
oh, i like that
God could start with the key due to the fact you get it by killing angels
but for now, thats the Binding Of Isaac: Rapture mod for now. feel free to point out some OP's i should nerf or things that should be fixed!
the there is other characters like Funguy, but im still doing stuff with him
God? starts out with 2 hearts, one half-white heart and one soul heart. god can fly and shoot transparent tears. he even starts with The Bible
but yea, God? can be unlocked by collected at least three items from the angel room in one run
kk, sounds fitting
About 2 normal should be good due to the fllies
its supost to be a joke to the Lord of Fly's book/movies, but i rly do plan to fix that
Reffering to azael because flight
Why the hp for lord of the flies so high azazel has three black hearts and limited range for brimstone
the last character i had planned is God?
his HP might be around 6 or 7 ~~lord of flys joke lol~~ and he actaily has the ability to shoot friendly flys instead of tears!
this is LOF (or Lord Of Flys) the way to unlock him is to collect at least 3 or 4 items that give you the ability to spawn friendly flys
to unlock you just need the items to turn into guppy to unlock him! im bickering over myself if i should make him start with ether 1 heart and 9 or something else though. he will also start out with Guppy's Tail, Guppy's Colar, Hairball. the basic guppy stuff
next is Guppy!
and Bob looks like that in game to
oh, well Oh Crap looks like that, but without yellow eyes
never seen it in game
i thought that was just how the transformation looked like
and yea he has corn for eyes
he has 1 heart but makes up for it with is fast moving and shot speed, he also will start with The Poop and E Coli
poop
he needs to be unlocked by getting the stuff to turn into Oh Crap
next is Poopy
~~ill think on that~~
~~oh yea~~
but it'd be OP with pyro tho
well i kinda find it not fair to be damaged by your own tears when as Bob, so yea
wew OP confirmed
~~your welcome~~
also, Bob will have Pyromanic
i rly like the Ipecac to, its fun
he'd have a slow moving rate like Sloth, and the basic shoot and damage with Ipecac
ipecac is probs my favorite item TBH
but yea, Bob i plan for him to start out with ether 4 hearts with black heart or 3 hearts and two black hearts, and i do want him to start out with Ipecac ~~obviusly~~
.................................................................................................oh yea
? <@162156525337575425> found Cancer
edmund said a lot of things.................................................................................................................
didnt edmun say id could hold a lot of shit we do?
with how many characters you are adding, i bet ab+ will crash
the way to unlock the transformation characters though is to collect the items you'd need to transform into them in a single run
same
i always wanted bob as a playable character
one dumb as fuck idea i had was to remove all transformations and make them into unlockable characters! making characters like Bob unlockable and aways free to play as!
ok
o
blocced
what about canker
ah, kk!
which you're not so you're fine
unless you're pajeet
nah i dont bully
i cant tell if im being bullyed here ~~coz im dumb as fuck~~ but i kinda dont like it tbh :^Y
inb4 ab+ doesnt have any support
inb4 ab+ doesnt have support for character unlocking
i plan for her to be unlocked by killing Mom as Lost
i say she'd have the same speed and shot speed as cain, but the damage with the knife is the same as aways
she starts off with three hearts and a black heart, and with Mom's Knife
thanks!
looks good
the next one is ~~the baine of my runs~~ Mother/Mom
same tbh
**leaves**
*im done here*
You could say, he has a *Boner* for them
i recently gotten back into it
i kinda just though id fit them rly, again this was like long ago. a year or so i think
true
You have an addiction to characters starting with two of a non-permanant heart
undertale
undertale
**this was before UNDERTALE gad daym**
undertale
and the way i though he could of been unlocked was by dying in the sacerfise room
his attack and speed would be the same as a normal boner, but his shot speed was normal
he threw bones instead of tears, witch dose make him a boner yea
he started with two black hearts and and the Iron Bar
undyne the undying
is this literally just a boner
next was this old character i called Undying ~~this was BEFORE undertale mind you~~
and the way you unlocked him was by beating the Hush with all characters
yea, that'd work
Well, since he's based off the hush, I would think a lower speed and higher fire rate than most other characters
<@224945708090916864> tbh i never though of those things when making the characters
nice
i got it
Attack? Speed? Fire-rate?
download isaac character editor
he started with two soul hearts and Papa Fly
first character i planed was this guy i called Hushling
~~dont pls~~
?
ok im ready to make fun of it
alright, ready to show. going to let you guys know that some of these sprites are a bit old, ill try to point out what ones are new and what are old
but yea, let me do a thing and ill talk bout it, you guys can also share your opinions on it if you wish!
**no**
meme
>afterbirth+ mods
Nah, you could do what you want, it's modding, we'll tell you what to change if said thing is bad
i do still plan for it, like make sprites, throw out ideas and kinda plan ahead for character stuff. if it is cool, would anyone mind if i talked about it a little?
i did have a mod idea called Binding Of Isaac: Rapture that i planned to make when Afterbirth + came out. i evently fell out of the idea because i kinda just got bored of it
is it just me or do flat penny and counterfeit penny look like they're floating
It doesn't activate anything upon penny pickup so visually it should be separate
Also swallowed penny should be not just a reskin of the other penny items
And less of a squishy structure
^ it could use some more detail
MONKEY PAW STILL LOOKS FUCKING WEIRD IS IT JUST ME
I think the lines on safety cap are fine, it's supposed to be rigged
?
still some unecesary lines underneath safety cap
improved many of the things you guys hated
Alright
yes
<@174193097285173250>   was Pinky Eye also in vanilla Isaac?
Paint.NET more than likely doesn't, and if it does, then it's extremely well-hidden
Don't know about GIMP
<@123098991742287872> Does Paint.NET and GIMP have auto line smoothing however?
those are the original vanilla sprites
This might just be a problem with vanilla Isaac for all I know, since I started with Rebirth, but Cursed Skull and Mom's Pearl have different light sources than other items
Broken Ankh doesn't look that broken
Rainbow Worm's a straight recolor of Ring Worm, whereas even Nicalis could be bothered to change the sprite
Same with Second Hand
NO! looks a bit too perfect for Flash
Some of them, i.e. Child Leash and 404, look a bit too close to being vectorized to me
Lazy Worm's eye highlights are coming from two different angles
As far as the trinkets go
Also it isn't finished so long as RAINBOW worm isn't a RAINBOW
It's a lot more consistent in the original than what you've got though
Line smoothing is one thing I would like from it as well, but I generally just draw simple shapes and then brush/erase in various places to transform them to resemble Flash, and it generally works
but i havent found settings to imitate flash with it
well, i use it too
Paint.NET is at the exact crossroads of rendering power and user-friendliness that I need
I haven't heard anything bad about Gimp whatsoever, I'm just saying it's what I use
like pixel art
while paint.net is better for simple stuff
gimp is basically a direct upgrade
http://www.getpaint.net/index.html
Paint.net is a cheap alternative to Flash for drawing item sprites
All ye aspiring ReFlash artists
thats not even consistent in the original XD so fuck you noodle
;D
you guys gotta do something about the varied outline widths
The safety cap has a couple lines underneath itself and the lucky toe could be a bit larger for the back
Very GOOD
monkey paw looks a little weird but other than that nice ?
great job
Nice!
finally finished ALL Trinkets ?
it's the best spriting tool

no other program has such a sicc soundtrack
everyone knows ljn video art is the best art program
no joke
on my holiday job i made pixel art in excel all day
excel is the best tool to make art anyways ?
you can always use MS paint Kappa
ah okay
I use medibang paint pro, it has an auto smooth feature, but flash is probably better
Jerbear  plans to do dingle
any alternatives besides flash?
you could also do dingle and corn dingle
i couldnt even find a legit original download
ive downloaded original source and used a serial like a pro ?
true

poor turd got shat on
nah but for reals it's pretty good
wow great job shitting out this turd
?

by request from wof i made it with a more shit color palette
Noice
bleh
watch out not to use it all up lel
I guess I could put hotspot on for a sec
I don't have wifi
to make the image as clear as possible
it would help if you can take a picture in the program itself

The backside sprite is gonna be a pain though
Wew, I'm almost finished
that looks good

1 turdling sprite done
It should be more circle like
Looks decent so far
Any thoughts on what I should change to improveit
Coloured it a tad bit and fixed the unbalanced...ness of the symbol and the penny itself
Though I can't colour properly so it would probably be stuck like this, after making it less rigid of course
Is this good so far
Oh lel

Fair enough! Damn good sprite, so I'd say it's worth it.
Wait

I'm burnt out for today haha
I will
Might wanna get the shit mines for brownie out the way though.
Wew
Uh, the line separating the teeth from th eedge of the mouth is a tad thin, but otherwise lovely.
Looks good, nice job
Does it look too good for flash? Or just right since it's a boss
My brownie in action! https://youtu.be/rEAoFwDik7Y
maybe
ill be doing turdlings next!
It'll be a few hours until I get home, though
Since that'll knock dangle out too
I might try dingle when I get home

and that's what makes it so great

Thanks, that's what I went for
So it's good
Looks like shit

I'm doin a flash brownie Lel
Even if the sprite is mediocre we'd be able to tell you where it could improve
<@224945708090916864> Worst case scenario, you tried, right?
I could perhaps make some art for reflash, but it would either look terrible, look nothing like it was supposed to be, or there was already a much better version to begin with
i may do that.
his lil haunt was really good
also <@174193097285173250> why dont you just formally ask kilburn if you can use his sprites
<@!123098991742287872> that guillotine is really good

not to mention the Lil' Haunts were vastly different
after looking at Ed's concept art, it's pretty much confirmed in my eyes that the Haunt enemies were never meant to have gums, just crooked teeth
because it's basically impossible to draw this in a way that Ed would while making it look good
but I've arrived at the conclusion that the whole idea of the Haunt line having such small amounts of teeth was fabricated by Nicalis
I've been trying at this for longer than I'd care to admit
here is lil haunt
That's acceptable, yeah
but my latest enemy is somewhat acceptable i think ?
fair enough
That's why Wof's sticking to items ?
that little haunt
oh sheesh
If you really need I'll re-reflash the mini haunt to avoid any issues

Speaking of <@174193097285173250> you should probably implement kil's mini haunt too
unless that's already been reflashed
could somebody with the assets unpacked do me a favor and send the lil' haunt sprite sheet?
<:isaac_cute:231218432148766720>

This storm has been weird so far
yeah I figured
it's flash after all
Saw the original comment; it's supposed to have less detail ?
ehh, nevermind

heeeeeeeere's placebo
fuck pajeet getting serious up in this shit
no but seriously make it less wide and add a rip on the bottom
xd
like this ?
but at least make it look ripped on the bottom :p
o
technically. it is ?
it's not rotated in the rebirth sprite
its the treasure map, in blue, and rotated
but the shape and stuff
I know
its a blue map. even in rebirth ?
blue map is a bit weird
hm

Can you send the sprite for treasure map?
<@!123098991742287872> here are all your sprites implemented ?

but yea. what jerbear said
i remove it when i replaced every enemy and every boss from afterbirth and rebirth
o
The point is not everything from rebirth has been flashed so it's disabled by default
I don't know whether or not he plans to remove it
classic mode is still classic mode
no
so you only took out a bit of classic mode?
yes i added some of rebirth but not everything
i thought you added some of the rebirth stuff?
<@174193097285173250> wait why do you still have classic mode?
that's rude

well its made by pm2k so no shit it sucks badly

no. only if classic mode sucks badly ?
nah
does it still crash everytime

Do you secretly hope that it will crash and burn
Half of the modding community is more competent than nicalis
tbh
Yes he did
And theres no restart run button and they dont have the "no free buttons" excuse on n3ds
Did the lost get D4 in 3ds version?
Wait
Also they forgot to give the lost spectral tears to go with his d4
Great
But while fixing that they broke more stuff
At least no more random crashes
oh
Were still talking about nicalis and the crash they forgot to fix is champion peep crashing the game for whatever reason
the hell ed
still can't get over the fact that nicalis is "the only company I trust with my IP"
Exceppppt
it's nicalis
They actually did that
instead of implementing worthless shit like that they shouldve spent time fixing the crashes...
Amazing
DIY curse of the lost
But hey, at least i can use the eraser to fill the entire screen with black more quickly than with the pencil
Yeah, you can draw on the map in the 3DS port. In my experience, it was a completely useless feature, not to mention that it apparently wasn't even implemented properly.
I heard about it like once and forgot about it
oh
...the draw on the map feature is an 3ds exclusive feature
._.
yeah
are you serious
wow
what is the eraser
Yes
you said the 3ds version, so I'm assuming the 3ds version of isaac
The eraser in the 3ds version
what are you talking about
It just creates a thicker black line than the pencil
what
Doesnt actually work
The eraser, their proudest feature (together with the pencil) that was used to promote the 3ds version
it looks like a cannon or some shit
Fun fact about the 3ds version
what the fuck *is* that
its a metal like bag with yellow things on it ?

Looking up "soul converter" just brings up isaac

oh
And the black things are wire
Somebody on reddit said its supposed to be some electrical converter
RACIST
what are the black things
no but why would a bucket have the black things
cut in half?
i think someone just went "just scribble a bucket with some shit or whatever"
It's... a mechanical fish?
But that doesnt really make sense
It looks like a weird paint bucket
it looks like a bag or something
it's like a hole you put your hearths through

<@!123098991742287872>  is very diligent ? i like that ?
godo
nah, it's good
that's my only concern
might be a bit too detailed though
yes

that is a flash sprite
that

The borders need to be ever so slightly sloppier
I want to say it's a little *too* clean for Flash.

yee that mouth is good
yeah thats too much blood lel

but once it was done, I thought it was just too much blood overall
I was considering that, and I do still have one frame mocked up for that
you could like have blood dripping from the eyes all like isaac style N shit
?

Alright, here's the Rage Creep sheet with <@!153966307593814016>'s suggestion implemented

na. the one mike made is good enougth. if you are bored you can do a new enemy ?
I'll do rage creep if you need.
thats better than mine ?
that looks authentic
yeee

something like this?

But what?
B- but...
_I'm not using Flash to draw these sprites_
I'm going to let you guys in on a secret
Also ciirulean that sad onion sprite was from when I was still learning Flash so it isn't really a fair comparison
Fair enough, but it's not finished yet.
<@123098991742287872> It's already a mod.
I noticed that How to Jump wasn't ReFlashed, he said it was because it was supposed to be a sprite, so I decided to make a mock-up of what How to Jump would look like in Flash, and continued from there.
I just showed up here today and started doing art when Wofsauge posted an image of all of the items that he has/hasn't converted to the Flash art style.
Probably The Binding of Isaac: ReFlashed, if I were to fathom a guess.
What will it be called when it's published?
But yeah, it will in fact be a mod, as far as I know.
Wofsauge is the one doing the most of the work, as far as I know.
This is going to be a mod, right?

this goddamn bottom layer
hold on
wh
Anyway, here's that ReFlashed Diplopia
fair enough
The contact looks a bit more warped than it should be but other than that it looks great
pardon me
ech oh god I forgot to clean up the bottom layer
ReFlashed another item, except I hate the resulting image less: Diplopia.
The more I look at it, the more it looks like total crap to me. Anybody want to give me a second opinion?

Alright, I ReFlashed a pretty easy target: Lost Contact.
I'm not saying the ReFlashed wall spider up there is perfect, but I'm fairly certain it wasn't run through a filter either.
otherwise it looks like it was run through a filter
okay, but that doesnt mean you have to copy it 1:1, i mentioned this earlier but you cant just remake pixelated sprites in vector form without adding detail where it was obviously lacking
Because it's on a much, MUCH smaller scale. Of course it's not going to look that messy.
but nicalis' sprite doesnt look anywhere near that messy
The only reason that the Sad Onion on the left looks significantly worse is because it was based on Nicalis's sprite for the item.
am I wrong? compare these http://puu.sh/rCxcX/51592c398e.png
Whatever. You do you, man.
yes and thats exactly what im saying, that the lines in the original isaac are not nearly that messy
Hence the messy fucking lines, to match Ed's original art.
is that somehow contradictory to what im saying
It's to make it look like the original Flash title
but the point of ReFlash isn't to just turn everything into vectors of what's in Rebirth/Afterbirth
The writing on the cover of How to Jump isn't nearly as messy on the book in-game either
this is more like how i would draw it
it looks kind of like you used the pen tool at multiple parts
<@66197463593136128> lines are not anywhere near that messy in isaac
***JUMP***
JUMP

so I just figured I would include it
but there was at least some semblance of text, albeit mostly unreadable, on the cover of Telepathy for Dummies
Well, yeah
you're never going to be able to see "how to" in game I think
TBH

here's my attempt at a reflash of How to Jump that took way longer than I'd care to admit
top right leg needs to be thinner, other than that it's a good start
<@174193097285173250> while reflash is the "hot topic" http://i.imgur.com/gNpC9Gt.png
hey <@174193097285173250> could you send me the reflashed sprite for Satanic Bible?
i know. nitpicking on a high level but i am german i need my order, disciple and rules ?

in the conversation before/after we just posted random reflashed sprites, without the intention to use them anywhere.
someone help me
how could there be any uncertainty that he made them for you
"assume" is the word ? im not 100% sure so i dont risk it
Knowing Kilburn he'd be fine with it anyways as long as you gave him credit
lol
I assume he made it with the intention for you to include them.
he made them for you though
and i dont use <@167363485326508033> `s mascara sprite since i havent asked him for usage permissions. i dont rip of sprites i dont have permission to.
heh
lel
yup. thats like 80% of afterbirth content anyways <@129339380090404864>  ?
also max's body is just a recolored players body
They need to be redone obviously ?
Noted.
some of them are still from the original mod creator. these are all the ones you guys hate right now
And getting used to it takes no time
teleportation 2 doesnt have any lighting, it just looks yellow
It's super intuitive when you get used to it
you might want to look in to flash
No offense, wof, but some of those look pretty... off
mysterious liquid is less detailed than the pixelly version
some more notes: dead onions mouth is supposed to be gaping open
that's what I was thinking
yeah
just keep the mario icon pixely
the cover can stay pixelly, sure
no it doesnt
that should stay pixelated. it fits better to the item
what about how to jump?
i changed it before you posted ?
tough>>
(of a substance or object) strong enough to withstand adverse conditions or rough or careless handling.
do you really mean tough ?
+ dont just use enemy sprites for items
also that tiny planet is really rough
also the outline on the negative needs to be black/dark gray
it looks a lot better than the one youre using
http://vinh.penisoft.com/ZZIJgdTMn9.png why arent you using kilburn's mascara?
aww yiss
monster manuel is already a thing ?
also bring back monster manuel
yeah looks like it's back
#bringbackmax'shead
wof plz
will cricket's head/body be renamed to max's head/body?
?
280 of 439 collectibles finished ? still some to go.
lmao
ayyyyyyyy
we can even recycle/reskin 6 bosses ?
Thanks, Afterbirth!
52 enemies left ? half of them are just reskins ?
yes
the 3 dips in action ?
***UNLIMITED POWER!***
CUTENESS OVERLOAD !!
?
<@174193097285173250> http://i.imgur.com/aVoZlHG.png
He shouldn't be too difficult
OK
if you want todo something more important than this sprite, you can do the dip enemy ! with one spritesheet of him, we can finish of 3 enemies from the list ?
Might be a bit thin, yeah
Hmm
but i like mine ? <@66197463593136128> . here is your worm implemented. its to thin i think
hot
i'll eat u
looks tasty i want to eat it
<@174193097285173250> http://i.imgur.com/Ge1HQlK.png
i dunno
well, the mod is to make everything look like flash, not to make everything look like it was supposed to i guess
now that power's back
i'll redo it wof
¯\_(?)_/¯
That kind of seems like it goes against the purpose of the mod
oh
...
but i want it to be a circle so it will be a circle!!!
If you'd like, I can redo it.
Yeah, he just recolored the Round Worm
Kilburn mentioned this a while back but the rainbow worm is supposed to look more like a rainbow, not a circle
~~the horseshoe is the best one~~
Those are pretty nice
i love this
only 13 more todo ?
cool
thank you for adding me to special thanks i have given you a heart for it
<@174193097285173250> It should actually be a rare room. Set the weight to like .25
o
The lag of running discord, steam, skype, google chrome, and binding of isaac all at the same time

bed+ demon beggar is OP
k
add me to special thanks
Yay?
*NEW MOD!*
Better Greed Mode Rooms
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2365/better-greed-mode-rooms
Now the Greed Mode special rooms don't suck as much!
i was probably missing something but eh who cares
That is your opinion and I respect that but I still don't see how the file browser is difficult to use, in fact I think you could get used to it if you use it long enough, about 2 months of using a mac instead should teach you enough about finder
<@224945708090916864> i dont dislike apple for what it does with hardware. its just another perspective on the usage of elecronics. they focus on accessibility and intuitive usage of the products, whilst microsoft tries to please newbes and advanced users.
resorted to using the terminal with `cd`
besides documents/pictures/other gay shit no one cares about
i was either retarded or something but i couldnt find how to access shit with it
Disfunctional... file browser... What drugs are you on and where can I get some
it's their purpose
games and movies are just put in life to make memes
games are just a meme anyways
it'd probably be pretty succ for games yeah i guess
if i could put up with its dysfunctional file browser id be ok with using a mac
because microsoft has such an amazing monopoly on it right now
i think i can only get max 30fps on it, i think it might limit it or something
windows is the one for gaming right now
yeah]
it's shit for gaming tho
I do agree the price may be absurd but I think it's a fair price for how smooth it runs, it's durability and how long it could last if treated properly
you can code on macs,too but i dont like that they are so exxpensive to buy and expensive to repair/upgrade. windows is more flexible on that, since you dont have to worry that much about hardware compatibility .
o
normal coding of software and such. linux can code hardware processes as well
linux is for edgy children who think using a barely working os makes them look cool
i prefer windows because i can do the things i want todo with almost no restrictions.
whaddya mean by normal coding for windows
mac is for people who dont want to learn anything about computers. they get a plug and play machine thats runs smooth but is limited in the things it can do.
Linux is for people who want to do hardcode IT things. they get control over everything but have to invest much time for that.
windows is for people who want todo normal things like gaming or coding normal things. they get normal control over the computer and have to invest just a little time for learning.
Linux, Mac, or Windows, wich one is the worst and wich one is the best
Also, may I have your opinion on something
That looks really good, actually
some  trinket spriting to cool down from the crash ?
It didn't break one week later
Also I have maple story on this mac
It was fun
thats what you get for playing maple story
sounds like you had an unlucky experience but
I've tried windows at least twice, the first time was an old model, ran fine just a tad bit slow, about a year later it broke got another windows, not kidding, broke in the first week, and all I had was maple story and the basics
ive had enough experiences with it to know how shit it is
i do lel
Barely functional, madame, it would seem as if you do not know this product
b-b-but muh open source
hey if you wanna use a barely functional os, be my guest
^
The isnults, clearly just another microsfot worshiping slave
it's evolving quickly bruh
linux is trash
nobody said a damn thing about gaming dont use that as an excuse
>i don't presume you'll be using linux for gaming
dual booting is some complicated shit
>linux >ever
actually i wouldn't call that easy
easy peasy
problem solved
just dual boot linux and windows
Plus you can just bootcamp that shit, and not have to deal with the underwhelming weakness between mac and windows, on one hand you have... exes and the other you have smooth running apps and a powerful firewall
Practically no crashes of photoshop
Not really, I had this mac for about 4 years now and still runs great
a mac will make things worse...
Get a mac, it will solve all apllication problems, apart from exes, cause FUCK every thing is in exe
rest in all the possible pepperonis mate
accurate reflash experience.
damn
das ist bad
whoa
FUCK !!!! IVE DRAWN 40 MINS ON ONE SPRITE AND ON THE FINAL LINE THE PROGRAM CRASHES -.- no backup, no save ?
whatever gurgling is made out of
did you mean: guts
GET ON IT EDMUND
imagine that for a new enemy
f l a s h t h e t i c s
honestly you may as well make the gurgling a rolling ball at this point lol
it gives it the badly drawn flash aesthetic
because
i think the gurgling looking like it's draging across the floor is a good touch
yes it is.
so is the mod you're making like a visual rehaul that makes isaac look like the original?
<@129339380090404864> improved the dirt of the worm , the mouth of the swinger and made the (Ball like) connection between the blob and head a little bigger. but i wont chagne gurgling. i like how it looks now ?
also the guts on the left side of the gurgling extend out way too much, it looks like is body is scraping against the floor
also the dirt piles on the round worms look like they were lazily resized from pin, because they were. point being it looks bad
why does the swinger's face extend down in two points like that if his mouth isnt curved downwards
Though the red glob could be a tad bit bigger
It looks fantastic
swinger is now done, too ?
looks pretty good, it might just be me but it looks dark...
yeah it looks fine!
Lil Gurgling reflashed ? does it look ok ?
Looks okay on my end.
<@66197463593136128>  what do you think? do those enemies fit in ?
alright so I posted about my own problem on the mod's page hopefully I'll get an answer, anyone is free to help me tho, even trying
damn
last update was months ago ?
my mod is acting up for seemingly no reason
does anybody know if the game got updated recently?
well, fuck. Still doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the stages.xml file, something is wrong in there
I think I may know why, I may try something later
i have never seen u talk before
For being a developer on the site, not of rebirth
help him lel
Edgy bro
<@206694318684110849> you have the dev label
i'm not gud enough at this shite to help you
nope, Ultra Greed is where Hush should be, I don't understand, everything seems to be fine in the sppecial rooms file. 
Someone help
mmh I don't understand. I mean everything seems to be fine there. I'll try again to make sure everything's right
because fuck the edits it made to greed mode
for me i honestly just removed the files that said greed mode for godmode
in this case it's every single boss
Use the search bar to search for the boss you're trying to replace.
<@66197463593136128> woah there are a lot of rooms in there.. Not even sure what to delete tbh
my eyes
...
mod this
http://i.imgur.com/oQEWRvU.png
okay
That one
00.special rooms.stb
I can't find the bosses' rooms
<@66197463593136128> what stb files ?
well guess It's time to dl that
okay...
You have to open the stb file in Basement Renovator and remove the rooms from there.
what do I do then ?
I'd guess so but then I have another issue. Will try again tho
Not exactly.
so I just delete the file so tboi will look for the default one instead ?
I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG
Indeed. Replace the old Isaac rooms in stages.xml
but i'm not sure
i would say remove the files that replace the original isaac bosses
so guys I've been wondering if someoene could lend a hand. Here is what I wanna do :
I have the Agony of Isaac + Savior Mod Pack working altogether on Afterbirth. However, I'd like to play with the original boss layout when it comes to level. Indeed, The Savior Mod Pack, for example, replaces Hush by Ultra Greed, and Hush comes as the boss of the Dark Room. So how could I play against the bosses of the original game with their respective layout ? Does it just take a stage.xml modification or more ? And if yes, what's the manipulation ?
Oh
nailed it
http://puu.sh/rAtdL/94d593f5bd.jpg
eau de toilette
eau
euaue
that's probably it
The worm slightly changes for its animation so I redrew the worm completely for the second animation
and it looks horizontally stretched
the dirt line width is wrong
i will fix that tomorrow. thanks for the sprite ?
ingame ? (animation looks weird tho)
that last frame is literally a butthole
didn't have the threshold up enoufh
I made it transparent, that's why ? since I just took a screenshot of the flash window to preserve the resolution
looks good but there is a very slight white border around the sprites. but nothing i cant fix. thank you ?
I kept the shading fairly basic, the rest just looked antialiased and didn't feel like it fit in flash
<@174193097285173250>
n
worst case scenario I can recreate that dirt
Yeah I'll manually scale it down
Well, that makes my job easier
could be a little to big but maybe it will still work
Reuse it I shall

That's definitely a possiblity
Hmm
Breath taking ? i like it ? (maybe you can reuse the dirt from pin ? )
Still working on shading, especially on the dirt

thanks ? <@111742218133307392>
nice job guys
ay thats going great
<@66197463593136128> here you go ?
Since I'm going to be stuck at home for a few days I might as well knock some of these sprites off the list
<@174193097285173250> Do you have an updated list of Reflash enemy completion?

lmao good job matthew
oh, so it's not even gonna hit my state
Yeah
<@173206704849158144> but it'll be a cat 1 and farther away so it'll be just rain
rip I ported his mod to the Vita and wanted to share it with him to potentially include with his thread
Not that I know
Not that I know of
Is the creator of "Binding Of Isaac Advance" here by chance?
*look at this*. they seriously expect Matthew to make a reflex angle of a turn back towards Florida to hit it again.
by the time matthew reaches my state it'll probably do jack and shit besides even more rain
Yeah, we'll live.
we're used to this
I mean it's florida
We've been through this like thousands of times before
And yeah, we should be fine in terms of Matthew.
Yeah, there will be an AB+ port of BoA before then, but it wont have all of the content
man, sucks that yall are gonna get hit by matthew
by that time ab+ will be dead
2018
Perfect
When would BoA AB+ be released? Bet on it coming out in 2018.
What will be in BoA AB+?: Freedom Planet 2 content and characters. Other than that, not much more.
Exactly. Those are fucking disasters. *Cough* Skyrim *Cough*
tyrone also did a twitter survey on paid mods a while ago
the fact that they even briefly mentioned paid mods
That's part of what pisses me off with ab+
?
Will it be monetized?: Heck no.
problem solved
just don't buy ab+
At the very least, I should give my plans for Binding of Avalice in Afterbirth+ right now
But hey, at the very least that means more quality can be put into BETA 3 of Binding of Avalice
At the very least, the trailer should release on Saturday Night or Sunday Morning
We've got shutters up, we're not planning to evacuate
We're on the east coast too so we're getting the worst of it
Huh
Same
Yeah
Oh you live in florida?
Trailer is postponed because of Hurricane Matthew. Mom is paranoid and stuff.
wha
Alright, change of plans.
that's the most binding of isaac image ive ever seen
oh boy
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuCRbbBXEAAkgwp.jpg:large
Now, for Binding of Avalice news
earthbound is only called earthbound because mother 1 was never released outside of japan
Since mother 3 never came out in murika it doesnt count
Which in turn is the officially canon earthbound sequel
undertale started off as a mod for earthbound called "halloween hack"
A true gba classic
Use the Kirby and the Amazing Super Triple Dream Adventure Squad Deluxe soundfont
Get your facts strait
Undertale was a DES game
undertale was on the calculator
wario land 4
undertale
Pokemon RSE aka French Horns
mother 3
any of them
Which soundfonts tho? GoldenSun? Mega Man Zero? Pokemon RSE?
now remake the OST with GBA soundfonts and i'll die a happy man
Whoa
dang at first glance I thought wow that looks like shit but wow some of those sprites are pretty good looking

hey guys thats my fursona, please be more respectful in the future alright
all you have to do to get it is type `brevon deviantart`
THAT IS HORRIFYING
but still
Yeah, I'll go with the old sprite.
I'm the (edited) master
oh

<@216324079504982016> kill it
THAT IS AN ABOMBINATION TO MANKIND, PORTAL! PUT IT BACK TO THE ELEVENTH LEVEL OF HELL
it curves to accommodate his eyes
also his head isnt just a perfect ()
its not that a thin sprite would look bad, its that you made it way too thin
<:isaac_shoop:231218479607316480>  my life is agony
this is how you draw
PUT THAT DEMON AWAY
_oh_
i think the old sprite is better tbh fam
OH GOD

Yeah just very stupid of me
well that's not how you do an isaac, get your shit straight
?
proof using his only center view
That's how it is in Freedom Planet
it doesn't look right
looks like a fucking pickle tbh fam
^
why is his head so thin
For reference, here's the old Brevon sprite. Which is better?
@here I need thoughts on this Brevon head. Is it any good?
Wait
<@216324079504982016> ohhhh that

<@216324079504982016> ohhhh that

Check Brimstone's anm2 file

still pretty great for a first time
that was a bit of an afterthought
apart from the shadow
thats looks pretty good
It's some of the dumbest shit I've ever made but I'd like to imagine it at least looks good for being trash

show us!
and <@!167027105836564480> made me do one of Garrett Bobby Ferguson, so I turned him into the Duke of Flies
so tonight I attempted to make my first Isaac-styled sprite
the 3ds is a very sensitive enviroment
You cant replace the animations b file. As for the anm2s there is something wrong with em. Most likely too large
if that's yours, the proper logo path is https://moddingofisaac.com/img/logo.png
Even with all vanilla's files, no mods, game crashes when i start a run. I had dummy animations.b files, and all of .anm2 files into resources/gfx folder. Still not working, i don;t understand.
<@190963577681608704> Me again. The problem isn't with the png to pcx converter, but with the "dummy" animations.b files and .anm2 files.
job well done

<@182475762111086593> check my post on the main site. It will let you use mods on the 3ds
Base stuff is done
Just need to pretty it up

http://ryderhicks.com/upload/8c966eff.jpg does this count as a valid solution
that's p awesome, would have been wonderful if I had a 3ds
all rebirth mods work for 3ds as well.
Some people works on 3ds mods ? Or worked on 3ds mods ?
i never realized how shitty visual studio actually is until now
thanks
if it becomes too much of a problem later where im constantly running out of space, ill definitely reinstall and do that
^ too many thems
Assuming you still have some free disk space somewhere you could create partitions on them copy visual stutio to them and mount them in the original location, symlinks to other drives might also work,
just managed to free up 700 mb from uninstalling microsoft sql server, smh
oh ok
I appreciate the offer though
nah I've got all of the items in so I've already done the vast majority of the tedious stuff, now I'm just making some minor adjustments like including item pool information
I'd love to help
do you need help with any tedious work?
nice
it's going pretty well, working on getting all of the items in so that players can easily view each others items and see what each item does
hey
jokes aside how's it going
of course
although portal won't approve
well i bought a 128gb samsung ssd and i'm pretty sure 128gb ssds are common
i'll inherit it for you bby
_that_
oh

is it common to have the same size drive
c# because i don't trust myself in an unmanaged environment
what is it in
Portal chan XD
who will inherit my multiplayer mod
Grab some clorox and I want you to drink it
what should i do
because fuck convenience
for the love of god why does visual studio have to be installed on the same drive as windows

Hi
Im using  discord on my tablet
With games from an unknown source

I need to document some files (3ds specific files or modifications) and obtain author validation, and i will upload that :)
Youhou, i made SaviorPack 1.2 with agony of isaac working on 3ds \o/

<@190963577681608704> womp womp
but they look great anyhow dude
i think some of them look a bit weird because it's still the original isaac faces on pokemon
i hate those pokemons xD
it was a real pain to do
so I think its fine
they look a bit weird but its still clear what pokemon it is
i though they looked weird

Can't say that I do
<@!66197463593136128> You don't happen to know where I can find the angel room sound that the main site plays when you download a mod do you ?
Now to spiff it up and add a menu selection
PoC part works ?



Damn
id recommend acquiring it on other ways
i dont think you can find any legal links anymore

No
Hey <@!66197463593136128> is this the right flash program? https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html
put the hair on the file character_003_cainseyepatch
mh weird
cain
for wich character is it?
im not at home anymore for some time so i cant look at it right now
also
i did that and its in the files but the hair isnt there and idk why
with the head
put the air on the existing sprite
what do you mean?
for some reason when I do that the hair doesnt show up at all
look at him
wow euhm, dont add hair or something, just do the head directly in his sprite sheet
what a handsome young man
also me trying to fix it
I need help with adding hair this is happening right now
ugh the vitas wifi sucks
The only bad part is these are hosted locally so it needs to be downloaded. But its still better then manual transfer and isntallation
What i need to do now is get a menu setup for other modports and offer a version for "Vanilla" so that users can get a clean installation before another mod with ease
it's the future
Autodownloads, extracts, and delets extra crap
that's awesome
autoports
so it autodownloads
?
Yes sir
that runs on-device?
oh snap
Did someone ask for a one click installer? http://i.imgur.com/xH79PWp.png

i "fixed" it a little with this method
d.let it
disgusting

yup
wait what seriously
that's the joke
do you know what a pain in the ass the "progression widget" is ? it has hardcoded pixelation filter in it -.-
nah quite the opposite actually Clown
boi
oh you
Wow you're building rebirth in the original game? Props to you
mmhhh
fuck that looks great
godspeed
ooh
progress ?
ripp
~~it's super easy in flash~~
aw dang
its a bit hard to do that with my tool
otherwise it looks good
i think that his left eye should be moved a smidge closer to the center, but that's just me
Not ideal, but better.
Better.
finished the skull haunt, hows it look?
kk
what those niggers said
first one
First one
which one is better ?
And yeah I am purposely making them slightly sloppy
tell that to afterbirth
instead of making things a green globlin
making things lazy on purpose
theres a skill to it i guess
sloppy on purpose
you need to make them
but
yeah
I can make the sprites sloppy ?
Hey, it makes my job easier
ive always hated how isaac's head was slightly triangular in flash
Could've sworn he was from flash with the way he looks
?
<@!66197463593136128>  here is the bat you made ?
the eyes on the left look off
now that you compare it the one on the right looks a lot better
thanks, i may check it out
MediBang Paint Pro <@!160981982849794048>
waaaay better
what program are you using?
that looks great
yee
does it look better now?
i believe i fixed it!
60 lines of changelog to be precise ?
also the changelog for that version is massive XD
119 mb in 1 hour ?
10/10 internet
<@!66197463593136128> i uploaded version 1.2 of reflash for the past hour (wooden INTERNET)  i will start doing the bat now
( <@220880063820857345> if you didn't see it, http://i.imgur.com/bmw7nyt.png)
Wof, how's the bat coming along?
+1 for <@174630956567756802>  ?
dats a staryu
also, look at this dooood
Neither of ours are close to perfect
better
I have the sprite side by side for comparison <@220880063820857345>
¯\_(?)_/¯
http://i.imgur.com/KNzcj6O.png
i would say the most outer borders should be a little bolder. and the eyes roundness a little smoother
still working on it though haha
i see
pretty good but a bit uuuwduqhcqhcqsbc weird
theres just a lil bit at the bottom which is a bit off
thats really good actually
heres the one that im working on
gg
wait. thats the old one
rip
yeah it definitely needs flash..
they still need quite a bit of work
is this a little better? (working on the right)
ill post it here when they're more smooth
working on the lines right now
rip
¯\_(?)_/¯
Works for me
i tried to get WINE doesnt work.
Flash runs well in WINE
I use Linux
i use mac also, so i dunno if i can use flash
oh
yeah flash autosmoooths
dont have flash, i use medibang paint pro. so gg
since it autosmooths lines
i already spent like an hour or two on it lol
Try remaking it in... well, flash
eh, ill fix it later
they could do with a bit of smoothing too i think
Yeah, the lines are super wonky
thanks ;D
but its good!
ow the edge it hurts
the lines are a lil wonky
edgy
hows it look?
i flashified haunt because i was bored.
i know right? wallcreep was a real mystery for me, but then, wow revelations.
staryu sounds good
here are some of the pokemon already made
i dont think i really need help for now, im doing stary
hmmm
he's already one
diglett is perfect for the worms in the ground
diglett is already in too

I have no clue how large the resulting image will be however
I can do that (you can export as png in flash I just haven't been doing it)
is it possible that the next image you send has a transparent background ? ?
? ? ? when the bat is flash alright
I went ahead and made the "angry" face details too

I found it odd that only the saves are acting different
which wouldn't work since it has my personal stats from rebirth in there lol
Thought you were going to use the checksum to validate this was a non-afterbirth save
ah
not even the 3ds has that for saves
Nicalis changed exactly one file in this vita port lol
Checksum won't help, I don't think
woot theres a checksum somewhere
gotcha. Thanks again
Load it in a rebirth save editor
Is there a way I can double check that save to make sure it doesnt have afterbirth content? The vita doesnt yell at you or anything so i cant check there
Thank you <@!66197463593136128>
Okay.
<@!66197463593136128> maybe the right eye slightly to the right so that he looks strait ahead. rest is fine. can you make the other 2 wing states as well ? i can do the rest of the spritesheet

<@190963577681608704> As requested, here is a Real Platinum God file from Rebirth.
meh
now i have to give this guy two heads:C
good stuff ?
When Afterbirth imports the saves it leaves old ones intact so I have my old real Plat save still kicking in my steam cloud
thanks
Okay, I'll get it to you when I get home
that works
I have a real Plat save
either or
<@190963577681608704> Plat, or real Plat?
its like you could eat it
sorry i only have my save of afterbirth.
trying to debug something for hte vita version of the game
I cant trust the ones I find on google.They all seem to have afterbirth content
It looks like you just puted a poop in a fridge for in hour and put it on a cone
no afterbirth content at all
Can someone provide me with a platinum god rebirth save?

ptitard
i may sound dumb but what is the pokemon in the center supposed to be?
it looks adorable ?
now i guess ill have to do evolutions
here they are
i guess, choose another path would be the right thing to do but i actually cant
?
well, i give up.
T___T
thats weird. then you have to edit the stb file and save it manually in the resources/rooms folder
i test, then it close and isaac dont open
still crash
ok
oh sorry
no, open the file with basement renovator
is all*
why are all this so complicated
<@174193097285173250> my pc dont know this file
test
its just for tes
?
yes it's a good name for this room
mean poop
try loading the Basement Renovator\resources\teststart.stb and edit the startroom.  thats how i do it
caca
i think i used a wrong path?
i create this, i push test, and boom it crashed
and retry?
cant i change the path?
they use both tbh
god dammit
it crashed again
<@!162156525337575425> i thought they used logmein rescue now
:Y ...
this would just help to see whats wrong
teamviewer is used by indian tech support scammers to steal your personal info
no
i need it?
what is this? >w<
hmm do you have teamviewer ?
the steam one?
which one did you choose ?
it wanted me to choose the resources file to test but it crashed '-'
sorry
?
ok it wotrks now, i redownloaded it
nope :/
in the first downlaodlink you can find an exe...
that's what i have
download there
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/3ze00o/
where's the program?
no. just start the program, open any file, open a room, place the test entity and press "Test current room"
seems more complicated for me...
uh?
and it makes testing sprites SOOO much easier
it's free
ya go get it
i know
w/e
basement
thats what i meant
basment renovator
^called testing option in basement renovator
i dont have basment editor ?
and test
make a room with ONLY poop
just use basment editor
ok now that i want to see them in action i dont see one poop restarts after restarts
?
that's freaking adorable
ill try them in game
i wasnt sure but now i think its cool
?
Good sprite
cute

omg
Poopcorn
he can have like corn on it
and with the corn poop
In terms of shape
ill try
Oh yeah, Vanillite would work
vanillate seems weird but why not
i dont want to use them but if i have no choice i want to use fakemons over normal poop
But its your decision
trubbish is a cool idea but i dont know about thor, the creator of the mod, he dosnt respond on twitter because of school
Eeeh, I dunno how good using fakemon would be tbh
Trubbish even has the poop shape
how about vanillite : http://pokewiki.de/images/9/92/Sugimori_582.png
i try to see in the fakemons of the pokemon fangames
Oh rip

Thanks for reading this one! It means a lot to me to be able to say this stuff to you guys ? Till next time, ~Nightmare
The Father
 
The Father is my version of the representation of God. He's a gigantic, intimidating angel, who will stop at nothing to take down a sinner. This is how I feel about God. You're basically fighting my interpretation of God. That's about it for this guy.
but i don't know if this is made up or something
The Soulless
 
The Soulless is the father of all demons, but he didn't necessarily want to be there. He really only wanted to have a life, which in his mind is a soul. He lures you into his domain because he wants a soul really, really badly, and he can only get souls off of those who already have souls, which just happens to be the players. His full story is told in the fortune machine, if you'd like to know that. fortunes.txt ?
godmode lore
shhh
godmode??
lore
what is this
Souleater
 
This one is the big bad demon. He has his 2 main bodyguards, Fallen Gabriel and Fallen Uriel. But the one with the lore is Souleater, so I'll get into him now. His lore links VERY strongly to 2 of my characters, The Soul and The Sacred. He has the final piece to The Soul, which is... The Soul (item). But only The Sacred can get the last piece to maximize The Soul(character)'s potential. But he pretty much eats The Sacred whenever The Sacred tries to win. The Sacred, to Souleater, is just a dream, a dream of a better place, without Souleater, and that's not really what Souleater wants.
um dying insideXD
The Grand Martial
 
So. This one is a gigantic, holy, six winged angelic abomination. And it gets pretty intimidating when you push it far enough too! But anyways, this guy basically represents my catholic faith. I honestly don't know how I feel about it, so I just try to hide it. But the harder you try to force me into it, the more I try to force it into me. But really, in the end it's not worth trying to do it because there is a breaking point at which my faith just dies entirely. So yeah, it's just a big, scary representation of how I feel towards Christianity in real life.
and show them!
Hello! DreamOfNightmares here again, and I decided to explain the lore behind some of my bosses. I decided for this time that I'll explain The Grand Martial, Souleater, Demon Priests, The Soulless, and my new one, The Father. So basically some of the major bosses ? but anyways, here I go :3
oh :3
no its pyscotic
wait, are you the one who did made godmode?
do you want to laugh at godmode lore its so fake XD
i'll let people imagine the lore of the pokemon mode
?
this is how you make fake lore like godmode
im crazy
XD
in my night while i was dreaming i had ideas for the pokemon mods. for the four The  Harbingers. 
it will be 4 pokemon monkeys Pansage, Pansear, Panpour and Aipom. and the horse will be Rapidash, Mudsdale, blitzle and Girafarig.
i want more mini bosses
That was harder for me than it should have been
...oh wait nvm
when i use notepad++ i see more, but it's full of nulls
do i need to use rebuild animation lists to unpack animations?
oh jesus, uh
oh alright whoops
<@229097082521124875> I use Notepad++ if that's what you mean
btw im running linux, how can i use ricks unpacker?
Okay, now what do I use to open it without it looking like a mess
you could actually get away with changing the name too if you modified the anm2 file accordingly
same name/directory
if you're replacing the image file
you shouldnt
Will I need to edit rooms when I change out the walking host sprites, or is that just for champion bosses?
And he did a good job
he basically brought that form of modding to the community
he was indeed the first one
yep
wasnt he kind of the first discover how to manipulate the animation files into making "new" enemies
I havent talked to him in a while
thank
Ill try to get him over here when I find him online again
nice sprites
there's the other one

Man lots of people seem to be remembering Jean lately
I just got here so nah
haha I Do Ciirulean ?
The mods in particular, if you're curious
remember when Jean-Alphonse was a thing
I could just make another sprite entirely then, that'll be easier
yep
I didnt understand right away what he meant
danke
thanks ciirulean
you can either tint it or change the sprite to another one altogether
Oh, sweet that clears a lot up
oh ok
basically you have to edit the anim2 file
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/33rh4a/modify_body_colorsprites/
and wahts the issue
I see
long story short, i'm modding walking hosts but their bodies are the same color
i just need some sweet tips <@111742218133307392>, hopefully
need anything?
<@229097082521124875>
whats up
hey
Anyone here?  I need a little help.
I think I'm going too far though :P
I've been trying to make them sloppy since WotL was pretty sloppy.
compare Isaac's head with that spiders head
those lines are reaaaallly sloppy
http://i.imgur.com/F3y4WLr.png
ye
Better.
better ?
ye
wotl has a different skin color
That's what ciirulean just said lol
small nitpick but isnt the regular rotty's skin colour a bit too light? compare it to isaac's
You might want to change the contrast a bit to get closer to WotL
And yeah, ciirulean raises a fair point

as you can tell by looking at the rotty's body and isaac
rebirth has a lighter "white" skin color than tboi
the skin color needs to be different
Definitely.
can you recolor it for rotty ?
Yeah, that looks better
a little higher. i think thats good enough ?
Could be the walking sprite's position but it looks weird lol
ingame
nice. thank you ?
Last two are just repeats, it took so long because I was eating dinner
http://i.imgur.com/0iIUUys.png
dat anm2
Lookin good ma dude ?
aaaand psychic horf is done, too  ? 101 of 167 done ?
should be good enough
That's really the only issue I see with it
You can tell it's mirrored
ive done conjoined spitty in the mean time ?
nice ?
Still working on getting the shading down
<@174193097285173250> Progress... http://i.imgur.com/NtaF5o5.png
nice
Okay, I'm home
Heading home now, then I'll try making the sprite.
since those are yellow on your sheet
I think I'll do skinny first so we have a comparison
It's super easy to recolor stuff in flash though
Quite a few are recolors, yeah
same for fatties. 1 sprite to make 7 of 8 fatty variants
but they dont spawn in miniboss rooms
i got what you mean now
the angles are new in rebirth
i hadnt really thought of that
also wow they added no minibosses for rebirth
how much of the undone stuff is just a recolor though
you can orient yourself on that spreadsheet. everything not green has to be done ?
http://i.imgur.com/BF8FPYm.png
Top quality Photoshop

Yeah, I'll have to give it a shot lol
my try on spriting enemies... looks more like hd isaac than flash
That makes things slightly better
At least Nicalis used anm2 a bunch
especially the bosses
wow that's a lot of stuff to do
thats the progression right now in reflash
Collectibles:     257/439
Trinkets:    55/90
Enemies:    98/167
Bosses:        68/99
Humbling Bundle looks really good there
i really dig fanny pack
yes. it definetly fit i think
They don't look too bad scaled down
your first two items ingame
?
I'll definitely try lol
the best thing you could do for me would be to resprite the enemies / bosses. the items/trinkets are small enough so that my unflashy artstyle does fit into the game.
Then I'll keep screenshotting them in that resolution.
na, the images you send where fine enough for me ?
I'll get the fla files to you when I get home
I don't know if I have the time to get all of them done, but I can probably do quite a few
No, it's fine ? I don't mind doing it
that would be nice of you ? if its not to much to ask you for...
I'd also take ciirulean's criticism in to count, because it's valid
<@174193097285173250> If you need I can flash more sprites, and I have the raw .fla files as well if you'd like them
?
good
i have a man in the fbi. he will delete my record ?
thank you very much ?
wouldnt want to get in trouble with the fbi
yeah you can implement them wofsauge
wha
thats illegal sadly
<@!66197463593136128> am i allowed to implement those sprites in reflash ? ?
Like, none of the strokes are smooth enough
Yeah I see what you mean ciirulean
cuboid
i think the pouch could be a bit more
i mean theyre good but not quite the style
almost like they've but put through a vectorizing filter
your sprites seem a little too sloppy
http://i.imgur.com/ALqNZBe.png
for comparison http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaac/images/1/1a/The_Sad_Onion_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20120707135431
http://i.imgur.com/EZypk3c.png
done, let me take a screenshot
<@129339380090404864>
Got it
yes
So I can reference the rebirth sprite but not the original one. Right?
and yeah I can do that
Well, it's less of an awkward angle and more of how bad the pixelation looks at that angle
I'm curious as to how they will compare
<@66197463593136128> without looking at the original tboi image, remake the sad onion sprite in the old style
on jerbears sprite, the original looks fine though
the bar itself isnt bad
with the outline
dat spike on the lower left corner
The angle looks fine
what's wrong with the iron bar sprite
The borders are sloppy, but so is a lot of flash
http://i.imgur.com/CuRwDgc.png
anyways I'm pretty happy with this one
you couldn't have chosen a better angle?
like the hell nicalis
Yeah iron bar looks pretty bad
That awkward spike on the left
¯\_(?)_/¯
http://i.imgur.com/dVwfZVm.png
Yeah
I feel like the shine isnt round enough
I think the shine needs improvement still on mine
<@173420370773147649> you just got outflashed, my friend
http://i.imgur.com/ot3F86Y.png
Some of the item looked way better
I wish Edmund stuck closer to his concept art
Yeah
and wotl sprites looked way more sophisticated and detailed
while looking at flash sprites for reference i also noticed how pre-wotl sprites looked really simple and some sloopy
I mean flash looks sloppy, but not that sloppy
That's part of it
first one has too thin outlines
I don't know, it just looks off
^
nice binning of isek sprites

please be gent[le]
joining the flash craze
http://i.imgur.com/dXfU8z5.png
otherwise it's a fairly standard game that gets repetitive really quickly
smb is only good thanks to its soundtrack
the main reason its hard is because every surface is coated with ice
smb isnt really that good
and better probably
not like there aren't already a hundred other games exactly like it
Because forever denotes how long it will be in development hell
I figured out why it's called super meat boy forever
that would definitely work well
ez
and we can redo stuff
but without letting one of their games fucking die
Where its like the people from team meat
what if we created team ReMeat
<@174193097285173250> you should make all of the worm trinkets the same color as wiggle worm in wotl
Yeah it was super sloppy
the sides are uneven is all
like it's kinda obvious you added the holes and edge things after
still looks pretty weird to me
Fixed
http://i.imgur.com/2clxqlE.png
I pulled a nicalis
?
Oops I forgot to apply the second level of shading
Now THAT's a horseshoe.
Perfect
okay i fixed it http://www.clipartkid.com/images/21/14-horseshoe-template-free-cliparts-that-you-can-download-to-you-UEtZKi-clipart.jpeg
like nicalis was it really that hard to add some horseshoe-like things
I might as well redo the entire thing lol
that's not a horseshoe that's a god damn pool noodle
I was going for upscaling the afterbirth sprite but since there's more detail to work with it could probably be improved easily
who drew that
like just
you could probably easily improve it
it doesn't even look like a horseshoe
yeah it is
golden horseshoe is so bad
Yeah, I'm not happy with the head either
the head is super weird
http://i.imgur.com/rK3rn8q.png Golden horseshoe
except the head
that's pretty neat
I tried flashing Tape Worm, just for fun http://i.imgur.com/kaQI1TN.png

Your broken magnet sprite looks more like a fiber tear than metal breaking
Yeah, I noticed that too
metal doesnt usually break that way
also the broken magnet looks odd
petrified poop needs to be not just a greyscale regular poop
*slow clap*
I'm having a Macromedia flashback if you know what I mean
Macromedia flash
Oh my god
aww yiss
Macromedia Flash 8 is *platinum* in WINE- it'll run flawlessly.
yeah
i think its close enough for trinkets and collectibles. do we both agree ?
p. close if anything at least
do the red underlined trinkets fit atleast a little into the artstyle ?
How's the arg going
So in other news
clean artstyle is easier to achieve for me than edmund style... but clean doesnt fit in the artstyle very good. i dont know if i still should continue anyways and try flashing things or let the project in the state it is...
much harder to emulate the art style when there are so many more pixels
it's tough
i try to add all rebirth items to reflash, but i fail to emulate the edmund look ?
ic
no clue
why are you guys redoing this ?
http://vinh.penisoft.com/ScxJcE5asf.png
takes some time to get things right
brush but then you gotta manually correct the strokes a little bit
do you use the brush tool or path tool ?
thank
also kilburn those sprites are great
^
lil bit wobbly
how is that ?
fuck man that looks epic
http://vinh.penisoft.com/ZZIJgdTMn9.png
ok <@173420370773147649>  thank you ?
looks perfect <@!123641250879504384>  ?
So maybe I can help
<@174193097285173250> I'll try my hand at doing some stuff tomorrow
Implement pls
?
maybe if i make like, a couple of them a day
i don't think i have the willpower to do all of them
http://vinh.penisoft.com/dvkgCUQ06N.png
Well I can run some Linux voodoo magic to make my tablet emulate a drawing tablet
but it's still pretty damn great if you want to replicate edmund's art style
then i got a tablet and moved onto better things
i spent about 7 years using it to draw with a mouse lol
same
I'll have to install It too, just to mess around with it
found it ?
it's pretty lightweight, compared to the monstrosity that is adobe flash
Dank* web
mm
in the dark web
you can probably still find it around on the internet if you know where to look
macromedia flash 8 to be more accurate
Flash
hmm ok. can you say to me what program you used for that image ?
i could try doing an enemy or two but i don't think i'd be able to consistently pump out content
i'd love to help but i have my hands really full atm
well that's kinda the issue
can i recruit you <@167363485326508033>  ? you are way better than i am
That's pretty close to flash, yeah
That's pretty good
could probably do better if i had a bunch of flash isaac sprites for reference
http://vinh.penisoft.com/BFrXH444pi.png
^
rip
But yeah
IIRC they originally wanted to keep it wotl
even though there's already a rebirth wiki that's much better
but no, whoever's in charge of this just had to update everything to rebirth and afterbirth
if only it could be an archive of pre-rebirth stuff
why does this even exist
http://bindingofisaac.wikia.com/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Wiki
you want the genuine edmund feel, gotta use flash
flash
well
do you know any good program for that purpose ?
ergh
with photoshop, because i dont know better ?
that doesn't look like flash
what do you even draw those with
ok. i will try around a bit <@129339380090404864>  thanks
Ditto
^
final note, don't just increase the resolution of the sprites without adding detail where it was obviously missing in the pixel art one. The haunts mouth is probably supposed to be gums with a single tooth protruding from them, but when you draw the sprite 1:1 in higher resolution like that it looks like he has purple teeth
also the line weight is too even, tboi's varies a lot more than that
Which is one of the bigger reasons that "clean Isaac" looked so bad
So it looks weird when you actually shade them
the shading that's around the top and the eyes/mouth are just aa mostly
<@174193097285173250> the shading on that sprite is really rough
retards
who buys photoshop ?
Oh so did you buy it or you know purchased with torrne.... legally
no i use photoshop ?
ancle wofsaueg is a veri goud cleangin mean
So do you use paint tool sai

I can't draw for shit
Oh okay
ive drawn that ghost with the mouse
no its a desktop pc with a mouse
Wat is the tablet is it a screen
its full of dust
yes but i havent used it in a while
Wait you have a drawing tablet
ok ?
There's a dot in the bottom

Ook

:C because he's always sick
hes always angry though
:C he looks angry noaw
Yea now its good
what if i do that?
Because it looks like it will cry or something
Well just light a bit on the top and then do it on the bottom
how can i fix them?
? ?
The eyes shadings looks weird
no problem. ?
i cant do either if thoses x3 i only resprite existing sprites... sorry!
i need a guy that trys to do flash art and one that can compose spritesheets  AKA copy paste files ?
what do you want actually? ?
:c
try it out. if it looks bad you can still draw the frames by hand. if it looks good, you have sparetime to help me ?
;n; but buuut...
you can just rotate the sprite. the thing is roling so fast, you woudnt see any difference
see? they are differents!
they are not really rotated ?
<@174630956567756802> you aren't actually drawing all of those frames are you. Like you know nicalis just rotated the sprite right

You don't have pyqt5 installed, then. At least not for python3

it was more bitching about tiny details like little pussies
fixed that color issue, too. thanks for the constructive critism ?
yeah
More like because everything else has a shine look on it but the keyhole is just flat colors
makes it look a bit bland
i think its cause the colors are a bit too dark
yeh
( ?° ?? ?°)
The keyhole looks weird on that door
thats right on
yep
god forbid its 2 pixels

exactly 1 pixel off
its

too
i'd say red glow on the door looks kinda werid
door itself
red glow on the floor or on the door itself ?
on the door
in terms of brush
I'd help with sprites but I can't find a way to imitate flash style
the red is a bit weird tho
It looks pretty ggood
yeah
does this look "boss rush" like , enough ?
tommy x jer otp
Good luck
Okay

oh that helps
If you're in the sudo prompt, you're typing, it's just not visible.
it wony let me type any thing
my dad has an account but im not on his
yes
Just to clarify. You have no password at all on your computer, even for logging in.
Then it should work
what if i change the password?
nope not working
try again
Can't say I've ever used a computer without a password
Just hit Enter, maybe?
Hmm.
don't have one
Put in your computer password
but i don't have one
its asking for a password
`sudo apt install python3_pyqt5` try that
where at though
i don't have PyQt5
Yeah, you'll need pyqt5 then you're set
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "BasementRenovatorAfterbirth.py", line 29, in <module>
    from PyQt5.QtCore import *
ImportError: No module named 'PyQt5'
Try the `python3 BasementRenovatorAfterbirth.py` line again.
Oh, you're in the directory. ?
again?
Cool, hit enter.
yes
Did it autocomplete, though?
yes
The text?
What is?
now its blue
ok
Put in `cd Desktop/Base`, don't hit enter, then hit tab. It should autocomplete. Then press enter.
Try this.
developer@K50IJ ~ $ cd Desktop/BasementRenovator
bash: cd: Desktop/BasementRenovator: No such file or directory
Nope
nope
Nope
i have the master does that matter?
so if it was on your desktop `cd Desktop/BasementRenovator`
it's `cd` then after that the path to the directory
In the terminal?
how do you get to the directory?
Shouldn't.
or tilda
like gnome
does it matter what type of terminal?
then again I also haven't used ubuntu in ages
I have my doubts, never seen an error like that in a terminal
yes
you sure that's the terminal?
wait
File "<stdin>", line 1

Oh that makes more sense

http://vinh.penisoft.com/65huTJ4cQ9.png
The first one yes. Now just the normal curse room door
wait, we're talking about trapdoors right?
I cant seem to find one in grid. Unless im in the wrong folder
Thanks. Last one. Does the curse room door have a different name?
gfx/grid/door_11_trapdoor.png

Hey, just wondering if anyone knows how to change the color of the particels in burning basement
Need to fix ui. upon importing it I broke the title screen as well as the consumable icons lol
Figured
You dont see it like that on the system
Yea :/
Looks more pixel-ly than normal, is that because of the Vita's resolution?
Just a few more things to fix. First being I scaled the items down wrong. Which I knew but did anyway like an idiot

Familiar resize and broken tear particle effect
WolfSauge and I figured out why its not working on the vita ?
back
It's from Rebirth.
the vita does that. Its either from rebirth or from the smaller screen

I havnt pllayed base rebirth in a long time
Rebirth.
<@190963577681608704> how did you got that bosshealthbar on top of the screen ???
dont see a problem with this gemini texture ?

"Jer grabbed Noodle's hand and said -Wait Noodle no! Its too dangerous! I tried helping him but it didnt work!- to which Noodle responded - I still have to try, dont worry honey, I know my linux stuff too-. Jer let out a deep sigh and let him go. As Noodle approached Tom he asked -Wh- Whats wrong how can I h- Tom quickly turned around, swiflty stretched his arm and firmly grasped noodles crotch, then he moved closer and whispered at Noodles ear -I have python-pip, there is no ms paint in linux- At that moment, Noodle knew, he fucked up..."
best fanfic ever
noodle x jer x tom otp
didn't work
nope
desktop
?
on what
try ctrl+alt+t ?
no when i open it and wait. after time it just dosn't open
is there an error when you try to open the terminal?
its mine
or someone else's
so is this your computer
thats not helping
guess you're out of lock
¯\_(?)_/¯
i can't open the terminal because of the lock
Then run it with `sudo` before it
im not an administrator...
worst case scenario it'll say "no such command" or something like that
Just try running basement renovator with `python3`
i have python-pip
sadly i don't even have that
linux paint
`1W
ok well here i go
wait how do i login my real discord
:/
the thing about linux is it has not ms paint
idc
use paint or something
i don't have photoshop
haAHAH
you put a lock on it
and blam
photoshop this over it
here u go
https://dbscweb.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chain-lock.jpg
you can put a lock on anything
It certainly would not be a thing by default, however
In theory
can you put a lock on the terminal?
tom is on top
i can play snake
its really good
they must procreate
lol
the 2 linux users on the planet
i use a computer thats like the terminals from fallout
wait
same
tom x jer otp
Won't hurt.
should i restart my laptop?
That's the only officially supported way.
Through the terminal.
what if i didn't have python3 . where would i get it?
It is nice background
I have to use window computer too
hot
i want <@147076393937797121> senpai to pin my pussy ? ?

same
my old computer was a window
hey i was given this computer as a last resort
you fell for the linux meme.
if this shit is too complex for you, you shouldnt be using linux
not to sound mean but yeah
You should probably install windows tbh
of finding python 3?
is there any other way?
can you do that on linux?
install windows immediatelly
:----/
¯\_(?)_/¯
my terminal isn't opening
if it does, you should be set, just run `python3 BasementRenovator.py`
It may be already installed, see if `python3` in a terminal brings anything up
where doi get it?
Additionally make sure you are running basement renovator with `python3` instead of normal `python` since ubuntu defaults to python 2
`sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`

ubunto
since it's different for each in terms of installing pyqt5
oh
What linux distribution (ubuntu, debian, arch, etc)
distro?
What distro are you on?
how do i check
Make sure you have pyqt5 installed
You're using the .py version, right?
the only problem im having is when i open the basement editor it opens up a new tab then prompts a can't run message then closes
Touching
:oooo
what
Jerbear has found the other linux user
<@162156525337575425> i'm not alone
I'm on Linux, that isn't the issue
but i don't know if i am able to even make one because i only have linux
so i tried to make a mod
ok
Yeah
is this where get help with modding?
ye

you can spam same with other people
even though it was a doublepost in context it was a necessary one
and it did just false positive the "let it go"
same
well we gotta spam "same" somehow right?
is there a reason double posts should be allowed
now im thinking
since that was for when discord was down
<@147076393937797121> can you revert the double post patch

That doesn't work because they can see the angel role on the side
they get a nice surprise
and for the cheeky pranksters who dont listen to rules and say "I want to be an angel"
just make the "default" path devil
"Resolved - This one was a tricky one - but we isolated the issue and it looks resolved now. We're doing a full post-morterm to get down to the root cause and fix it for good. "
imho they shouldnt tell you about being an angel in <#206675708221718531>
Not the best, but better than it was.
Looks like Discord's response time is down to 35ms.

Whirlipede finished (not really)
this would be so intense
I'll experiment with it lives, mom, and isaac
taht makes sense
??? isn't required. My theory is that satan does a "room clear" check before it goes to wave 2, but since ??? is alive the room isn't cleared, so he never comes out of statue form.

<@220546423265951745> I'm working on a mod with pm2k and ciirulean called Colic. It's a vanilla-esque expansion and also tweaks the game to be a bit more... interesting
That was not what I expected

omg you guys and your english pokemons
whirlipede?
YEEEEEE
whirlipede could work for Guts
yes
good choice
i wont continue this x3
he sells shirts and stickers
oh
thor wanted money for school ?
yeah it was a meme
whirlipeded
ah
they sold shirts for the mod
<@162156525337575425> wait what
:^)
ROLLIPEDE
what was scolipede's pre evo?
no no babies are fine
Just messing with ya, I dont think scolipede would fit anywhere unfortunately
and stickers
rekt
i guess selling shirts didn't really work for the shill
?
ill try to make him a baby
if no scolipede ur getting banned
hehe ?
scolipede? okay
sadly thor will abandon it because of shcool and stuff, and because i already helped a lot ill got it
:>
I want scolipede in
yay
<@173420370773147649> you have fine opinions my friend
ayy neat! ?
but gen 4 is prolly my personal favourite
im the one who will adopt the mod when thor will abandon it
or just another dude also making a pokemon themed mod
gen 5 are the best pokemon games
Hello misterIn! are you the binding of pokemon dude? ?
??
?
you
because of the pokemons following
just
they are just
same!
hgss are my fav pokemon games tbh
omg not this
>ash greninja
>greninja
it the popularity poll from japan
i used pokedex sprite as reference:
because it would make sense if it was
was that pic a popularity poll?
ill change it
i  guess you right ?
the solid color is alot more noticeable
artwork from gen 1
that's the classic mew
but the colors on the right mew's tail trigger me
because im using this
right one is more kawaii
right one more like modern
that darker pink looks better
left one looks more like classic mew
yeh
i should :/
<@174630956567756802> why not those colors for mew ?
beautiful

i like stupidity :3
because of muh scaling health
?
yeea
it would be stupidly boring
still sloggy
i cant remember the link
what would the game be like if hush was in every room
ye
bloat mode is a thing
but that
dodging simulator 2016
oh and make every single pickup ultra greed
bloat would be cool
^
too sloggy tbh
whelp let's put that on the todo
im giving you ideas
...do not give me ideas.
what would the game be like if every single enemy was ultra greed
but since wallvariants were at zero it didn't know what to do and crashed
so it knew walls were supposed to be there
I set walls, but not wallvariants
?
WAIT I might be an idiot
:c
its probably just a result of the tail being behind mew
yea
the base of the tail
mm
seems weird
:3
im making it
but where is the tail ? ?
XD
thanks god mew will be really easy
lua support for isaac is pretty mad
^
i dont think so misterIn. we have seen that we can do exactly the same things as now. maybe we only have to append 1-2 new files per mod but texture editing stays the same (I hope)
:T
it will be harder for modders that only do textures :C
i imagine that the player base for rebirth will increase alot with afterbirth+
altho a complete overhaul would most likely require something from 4 parts
it wouldnt be hard to make a mod out of the 1st part
before the pokemon mod i wanted to do a sega superstar mod
gureato*
i think that would be great
i dont know jojo enough :c
i would give my first born child for a jojo mod tbh
god forbid he gets a counter off on you
:3
ye
wynaut and wobbuffet are based on japanese "push-back doll" thingies so it makes sense actually
but thanks anyway
i guess i can do it ?
bodycolor
fix what? ?
should i fix that for you ? i can do that
wynaut would be wierd
fair enough
because wynaut is a punching bag
:^)
wynaut make it the punching bag?
yeah it is
I guess its punching bag?
because he use the body of another monsters :c
like sack boi
im guessing its just supposed to be a head
why is the body of "Isso" not blue <@174630956567756802>  ? (isso = http://www.pokewiki.de/Isso)
yea that
relic
ahh
its a arceus statue
yeah replace the thing cross-jesus
he's pretty blu
next to litwick
is that arceus in the lower right?
thanks >w<
oh thats bootiful
yea
the familiers are already sprited
im guessing "that one that u get when u beat mega satan as de lost"
I'm guessing -0-
ahh
no i wish to replace all of the coop babys
which familiar does that replace?
?
ayy arceus
<@174630956567756802> that looks very above decent
still
It's Nicalis you're talking about kil
i did this garbage mix of pixel
although it makes me wonder what they could have possibly changed from the dark room to cause that
Thanks Obama
We ported colic to Afterbirth so we can fix it and this is how Nicalis repays us
Dammit Nicalis
amazing
Yeah
so it seems to be an AB issue
looked at "the room" mod
"<backdrop id="11" gfx="12_DarkRoom.png" walls="1" wallvariants="2" floors="1" floorvariants="2" />"
Also I'm downloading Savior now for "investigation"
I know Savior makes Chest The Room, what does it do for dark room?
Or I'm an idiot. Both are plausible.
Probably.
maybe they just broke it in afterbirth?
I wonder how savior changed it tho
same
same
I'm sorry, I'm not a big deal. I have been a lot of the day.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

I would've themed the entire floor to be the Shop but it appears the Dark Room is hardcoded to have no walls (setting walls to anything above zero results in a crash)

<@174193097285173250> Are you just adding what could not be removed?
Still need to finish the characters as well as all the other odds and ends for my mod
Cool
nice
next reflash update gets +12 afterbirth enemies ? and lost ?
you should probably take a look at the brimstone beam, lasers aren't going to have outlines probably
is moms foot just a giant laser then
Or this
http://youtube.com/watch?v=xPF8bkLURY8
It is based off of the Syntax boss fight in Thermal Base
Yes it is
mom replacement for binding of avalice <@173206704849158144>   ? ?
working
if only hard mode mobs got eternal sprites
eternal charger
Also why can't I find any items
It needs to be more adorable
don't do that
I'd say meet in the middle
though I do like the colors on the right one
left one definitely
the dark one
ye
thy
The left one
Which drowned charger looks better ?
Sure it was hard as hell to make but hopefully it might pay off
We just want to get people interested in the mod and modding in general and we felt that this was a unique way to do it
That's why the ARG is our only potential advertising campaign for the mod for quote some time
done
if you wats a revolution, just wait a lunar month
as was the moon's last revolution
not the third reich
:p
as was every revolution ever
as was the american revolution
IDK, the Russian revolution was more revolutionary, in my opinion
oh, ok
b- but nms was "revolutionary"
well, not really
You wouldnt want to do the next no man's sky right? ?
so people dont get disappointed if in the end the mod support's not good
we'll try
fair enough, my main suggestion is, for the time being, try not to hype it up too much
~~we've even had issues with people distrusting Ed's mod support~~
but I'll accept the risk, for now
I agree 100% with you
lol
but yes, I just want to save you guys from working too much on something you may not be able to do fully. I hope the end result's good, but right now too much seems to be in the air as to what or how it'll be
~~well, technically ,this isn't a leak, don't kill me, please~~

:>
dont get smart with me boi
ye that
I've read what you've said (or have I ?)
you heard waht I said anyways
but yeah
no trace
there ya go

...
fair enough hehe
on the what?
yes, I agree
and that is only a collection of ideas so far
I totally agree with you
but you guys seem to be putting too mcuh effort in to a project you dont even know if you can make
ok, just say it
Heres the thing, I dont wanna come across as a dick, I say this with the best intentions
I wanna tell you some, concerns, lets call them that, I have with the mod if you dont mind
Hm ok
yes
yeah he is
?
you're one of the main guys in the Ipecac mod thing right?
In all seriousness though
lol
Hehehe
Heh good answer, cause I dont think you expected to have an Argentinian moderator over you ?
*disappears in a smoke cloud*
instead, let's say it's ok
one would expect me to come with hatred, but why do this?
What do you think, as a brazilian, of Argentina :> Lets see if you answer right heh
ok
here's a key question for ya
hey pedroff
RUINED!
you're right
or mom
it lacks the feature to become poop
Noodle.
who made robo-baby 2.0 (The bot)?
lol, ok
Ill get cha next time ?

don't forget thermonuclear physics
And ARG support
yea. how did that guy missed to add bunnies and proper Cthulu support -.- fucking idiot faggot
sure
it's _almost_ as big of a wreck as AB
alright
woah woah lets not go as far
it's as big of a wreck as afterbirth
bigger trainwreck than no mans sky was
wolf sausage fix your mod
^

wataguy
Wow
Because so many things were wrong
He already needs to update it
This is how trash ReFlash is
same
im weak
ill eat ur guns
yes it does
eating guns doesnt sound very good

being fed nothing but doritos sounds like a pretty good incentive for not doing the work
true
feeding them only a bag of doritos over the course of 24h
its better to kidnap them and force them to do what you want at gunpoint
yeah but if you ask for things you will never get them
translation of what I said: Its not nice to demand things, better to ask for them ?
but we are all special
idk
huh, wasnt aware Pedroff was Cirulean's boss ;>
pedroff is special too
that could be cool
@Ciirulean#6738 , now, ***please***  make a decayed gurdy
We need to finish what we have started
<@173420370773147649>
<@173420370773147649> is right but i didnt try to upscale the death animations as well. maybe this can fix the issue with the deplacement
ah
so I guess it was too complicated/not possible
So yeah
Also the death animation appears above enemies when its not made invisible
its 18
RIGHT
it is?
oh
It's already out
<@174193097285173250> awesome job with reflash dude, cant wait till its out, Im curious though, was it not possible to port the death animation of enemies? is it too complicated? Or just cause its still WIP?
i was very proud for a first project
they were sound and dialogs like "ma boi"
yes
that's beautiful
i fucking changed the intro shit n stuff
ikr
literally why
and streams isaac
Must resist cringe
it was for a youtuber who makes Youtube poop
oh god
peppa pig
does it shoot up the block
i mean look at what i made
i dont think so
it was really shitty though
of course ee
?
I might've deleted it
hmm
um
show us ?
you're right, we *should* see
show meh! ?
you should see my ragman sprite when he was first teased
that's way better ?
urk
that's pretty good
this is disgusting, but im starting!
i mean, look at mines x)
wow
plus im proud of the name
it was really fun to make
this is probably my favorite recent sprite
<@129339380090404864> got any of your newer ones hanging around?
show me!
you should see his newer sprites
he's isaac sprite jesus
because he's ciirulean
they are actually pretty good ?
wha
this was the second one I made, dont believe ive shared this one anywhere
yeah
not saying much
honestly it's still better than a lot of mod sprites
its actually pretty shit looking back at it
this is the first rebirth sprite i made
yeah
^
cheating
/r/nocontext
just a bag of severed cat heads
i am a strong, independent black woman who don't need no man
i dont need no friends
"oh no i dont need no memes"
i made mods for french youtubers so :Y
pm2k acts like he's a big boy
¯\_(?)_/¯
and ? we need memes
lol
^
so eh
the only semi-famous mod I made is a meme
id take being a good artist over making fucking godmode
atleast your sprites are good
mostly because I've never really made a large mod

Q____Q
^u^ thanks!! now i just need to make 200 others
they are awesome ?
you like em? qnq
?
i did all of them for now
I really like this one, if the others are like this one I think you're doing great dude
yaeh quq thanks a lot. im making the babies for the binding of pokemon mod, and i tough they didnt looked so good.
The greninja looks great <@174630956567756802>
Sealed.
can someone tells me if he looks cool?
add me to special th.... oh wait
add me to special thanks
add me to special thanks
why ?
add me to special thanks

That upload speed though
rip your upload speed
had to restart the upload because icon was to big... luckyly it had only uploaded for 10 minutes, not finished uploading and then trowing an error -.-
109
(109mb @ ~70kb/s upload speed ? )
upload started !
because of how weirdly room generation works
and even if, I dunno if I can even fix all possible crashes
nope
have you updated classic mode already <@173420370773147649>  ? ?
you should probably also add a disclaimer that crashes are most likely caused by classic mode
wait just 90 minutes ? i have to upload that mod with my 700kb/s high speed internet connection
<@174193097285173250> release reflash :V
nice sprites. looks like its part of the game ?
http://puu.sh/rfasr/f7e0b39d4d.png also the cultist cries darts neat
got all the items done

**Help request: How to mod enemies** *by SuperDementio*
If someone can teach me or link me a tutorial on how to mod enemies I would be very grateful, I can't seem to find any information on google or the wiki.
**Link** http://redd.it/53aq5w
baspargo
more like *golden machine gun* bazspinga
^
the rules of modding a game is to uninspiredly replace random word in title *parkour fortress*
especially if you give it to a character with low damage like samson
those items together actually create a pretty unique playstyle
like the bullet would have spear of destiny and lost contact
it's fun trying to come up with fitting character items though
side face sprites are the real mod killers
I mean if I were to do a gungeon mod that's what I would have done
did "enter the basement" not even cross their minds?
"THE BINDING OF GUNGEON"
way better than the other gungeon mod
http://puu.sh/reVdJ/802258b59c.png and now to never touch these sprites again
seems like a lot work. if you want that feature you can help with that shit ?
including WotL and eternal update
from flash to AB+
even better: add a menu where you choose the Isaac version you want to play
will it have eternal update option? Make it a thing when AB+ is out
reflash seems great
¯\_(?)_/¯
Whay ?
do they not have eyes
Wow

yeah seriously why do russians do that

<@129339380090404864>
you learn something every day
death's skull uses the same exact colors as the wings on the level 2 fly
yes perfect
and we start the video with nothing prepared. so close recording program, open notepad, go to google, type in moddingofissac, and so on ?
so you slowly go to fix the mistake when you finish the word
and make mistakes often
and be sure to type at 4 words per eon
yes
<@!160981982849794048> we use this song for the notepad tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfS5zVfGBc
also that looks pretty good <@174193097285173250>
^
the readme file leads to the notepad tutorial video on how to install it
mfw http://i.imgur.com/cNl7wBT.png
small sneak peak on the mod before release tomorrow ?
im a pretty big deal
i always read readme files
^
for some reason
no one reads readme files
i will add a readme file with instructions on how to remove classic mode ? that should fit all needs.
that way normies will learn how to install classic mode
and there has to be at least 1 wmm rainbow filter
let the bodies hit the floor
^
or alternatively
add me to special no thanks
and 009 soundscape or whatever it was called
add me to special thanks
tbh
of course I never bothered to updated it
using notepad
tbh
make a tutorial video
tbh
wofsauge ripping me off tbh https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/282/classic-item-pools
but then normies wont know how to install
yeah may wanna put it in a seperate folder just in case
ok good
lol
ok good
ok good
<@162156525337575425> i have permission
put the classic mode in another folder
not so much ? just 3 enemies and some items that cant be removed ?
as long as u have permission
simple solution
that is, unless you have afterbirth/rebirth content of course :p
yes
My vote's on yes.
Short Question: should i release Reflash with Classic mode Preinstalled or not ? (Classic mode removes all content thats not in flash isaac)

**Afterbirth+ not worth it?** *by Hedgy134117*
Ok ok ok... I know it will definitely be worth it.. but not the whole time.


i recently got into isaac modding and everything is a lot easier than i expected. I know we don't have as much customization, but afterbirth+ fixes that. The only thing i worry about is that it will be harder to make mods 
**Link** http://redd.it/538ay1
ahhh i see
maybe i dont know
wait
thats how the base files work
i know
You have to modify the .pngs in the gfx/backdrops folder
the xml file that determines what floors have what backdrops
What files did you try to modify?
they should look something like this, strangely when i copied undertale's files it worked properly but when i started modifying the base unpacked file it didnt work
yea this annoys me a lot, ill have to track that file down
For every stage
Cant remember the exact filenames but there are two "floor something" filrs
that makes sense
Yes
are the L shaped rooms and thin room floors saved in a different location than the main sprite file?
<@129339380090404864> Why "mom's gift"?

Mission accomplished.
hey <@129339380090404864> you around?
that would be cool
I'm trying to toy with the idea of turning Chest in to a full-on blue womb floor
however, I can't find for the life of me where the boss room for Blue Baby is
Okay, I'm probably just being the world's biggest idiot
^
save as type all files
yeah they act as text documents for the most part
and add the EnableWaterSurface line
as a text document?
then open it in notepad
Just make a new file called config.ini
how does one make a file in .ini? sorry for asking so many questions, normally i would just take a file from the undertale mod and swap it out for my own files, but i dont seem to have that option with this
Yes.
do i need to make the file myself? i dont see it in the unpacked folder
Theoretically
it is kind of a cool effect
can you enable it on floors that dont normally have it
it's fxlayers.xml
Those are in overlays.xml if memory serves correctly
No
are the other overlays also in that location, like burning basement?
In config.ini set `EnableWaterSurface=0`
is there a way to make the flooded caves not flooded
if you combined it with the soul you'd be eyes
speaking of i would like to see super magnet given a neat upside and become an item
So it's just super magnet
all it does is suck enemies towards you because balance
if you pick up void, the smelter and magneto you transform into kirby
much more interesting than the "shop item that allows you to carry two active items" that gets suggested every other day
the trinket absorbing item was kind of lame tbh but I did like how void can consume active items
The catch is it can only absorb neutrals
Next we need a pill absorbing item
^
and even that isn't very good because a good chunk of the trinkets are useless
the trinket absorbing item was easily the best one they showcased tbh
same
My Ideas Are Sacred
tbh im pretty relieved that all of the items they've showcased for ab+ have sucked
?
no because nicalis already cheated us

it being better than what we currently have is not saying much
aside from saving money maybe
I don't really get why people would stick to afterbirth, or why people are staying with rebirth
I think you guys are being overly pessimistic about ab+, like there's no way its going to be worse than making variants of enemies and bosses and looping their animations to make it seem like they have custom attacks

I have a feeling the majority of us are just going to stick with Afterbirth

I guess I'd use Wof's mod, but if someone changed something from AB it wouldnt work. Doesnt really matter anyway, we will all be forced into AB+ soon enough
oh yeah
so that probably won't work

Well, Afterbirth does have slightly better modding capabilities
I meant that we should just ban afterbirth from ever being brought up or used in a mod
not what i meant
Nonono
Which mods do you want ported? I might be able to ghettoport some of them
Can we revert mods to Rebirth, please? I want mods, I dont want afterbirth.

add a tyrone word

My randomizer now has item type-specific names and descriptions
then it may work for you
this is pretty slow so it may be
never tried it for anything
could try looking into filesystemwatcher or something but I'm not sure if it's fast enough
yep :/
yeah the automatically part is what sucks
automatically
it does them one by one
oh you just convert all files at once? I thought you did each separately
The issue is doing it. From what I understand a backround worker needs to watch. However imagemagick doesnt report progress or anything
since you have the amount of mod files being converted a progress bar shouldn't be hard

Now if only I could figure out a progress bar for image conversion. Console > PC takes a very long time for large mods
hahah nice
Noticed how shitty the tool handled large mod conversions. It didnt even give you a heads up when it was working. Now theres a warning :p http://i.imgur.com/SvpRKQl.png
Ill take a look thanks
<@190963577681608704> if I remember correctly Rick's unpacker can do that
Anyone know how I can view the games "a" files by chance? I think I can get afterbirth working on the vita
Genius!
Lost
What about the devil room but everyone gets the same treatment as the most
lol
Hey guys we should make item room restock too AMIRITE
Why tho
Why
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/52a98h/item_idea_demonic_restock/
Ohhh
so I do want people to look there first
yes, but you need to click on a player first on the list to see their stats
Because typically people look to the left first then right
Swap the player list and player stats
You should though
yeah I felt it was a bit off with the font on the bottom
You should
It's consistent
Honestly, I think the bottom picture looks better.
https://i.gyazo.com/695eff15cc13226742fff26d59d302c5.png or https://i.gyazo.com/de994f8299c061cef1c6868eb46483b4.png
i'm not sure if I should use the font that binding uses on the bottom part of the player information panel
I could use some feedback from someone
It's portal
Eyyy
K
just wondering about it in advance
thats fine i wont be doing this today anyways, its really late
I'd check for you but I won't be home for another hour
That works too
ill just store the x, y coords
That's what I do
eh
guides?
Then you can make guides in Photoshop
pm2k told me to do that but i had no idea what i was looking at
Check the anm2 file, it'll have the exact offset for the names.
how can i tell the exact offsets of the names
http://i.imgur.com/0AXAVkO.png
help me dot his maybe ill add you to special thanks
maybe
add me to special thanks
K
Yeah
so if i just changed them all to lowercase it'd be simpler
and i use said strings for these filenames
Well, to my knowledge
well the xml ones are stored in strings for me
Doesn't matter, you can have it in all caps in XML if you want
and say in the xml i change all of the files to lowercase, will it work properly on all platforms
Even if you specify caps in the XML files Nicalis hardcoded the Linux version to lowercase
alright
Correct, because Nicalis is gay.
that filename needs to be all in lowercase for it to work on linux right?
oh yes i wanted to ask you
correct
10/10
So it can generate boss portrait names now?
<@173420370773147649> atleast search if theres a C# equivalent for this https://github.com/portal-chan/Isaac-Character-Editor/blob/master/nameimages.cpp
oh wait cleanbirth fixed it
is there any corn poop retextures because they look really bad
right thats also nice
Right
Oh, you can use the font rather than the separate images
thats why its better than stitching shit together
well mine would resize the font incase it doesnt fit in the image
Well, actually I could just reuse my icon sheet stitcher code
unless you wanna look at it for ideas on how ive done it idk
Hum
but its C++
Can I steal the code for the randomizer
http://i.imgur.com/B9CJefo.png mac version inc

Could their size and position be it
The item icons look weird
that's got to be it
there's a blue thing on the left of the image
The pause word has a !
10 points to gryffindor, if somebody can spot the hardcoded part of the pausescreen !
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
have been moved
loos like the admin
Looks like the admin is removing them. Lets see how long they last lol
yup
Just need toc ome to terms with it
Looks like the site is known for this. Might be a lost cause.
ive had my editor reposted to a bunch of mod stealing websites except it was stolen by the owner like every time so...
I sent the owner a tweet and PMd an admin. With any luck it will be removed. I dont mind it being shared. But at least give credit,...
yeah it sucks
So im not surprised...
Some vitapiracy website
reposted where
this is going to be fun to rectify
Someone just reposted all of my vita work without giving me credit...
wtf
which makes it look very noticably brown
I assumed it was because it wouldnt look so dark with high gamma
Now I won't be able to unsee it, thanks
if you look very closely the one on the left has a different outline than the other sprites
y tho
hahaha look at this
wat?
except one
every sprites' lines are black
i'm looking at mega maw's spritesheet
this is super weird
scuse me
wait what
i understand that they're a bunch of losers
Nobody understands Nicalis
haha
i just don't... understand nicalis sometimes
also they work with photoshop
i don't understand
some spritesheets have fully black outlines
it's strange, becus
then again
Is it really that hard to keep a psd (or whatever program they use) of the sprites around?
Idiots
so they can preserve the outline
so they went with whatever was the closest to black
which would kill the outline
they'll probably load up the transparency as black
and since the spritesheets are .png
my theory is that they probably load up spritesheets to other programs
i use a dark red color in my game so stuff  looks better against black menus but they are really inconsistant with ti
Some "blacks" are dark red
I have found no reason for it
Nicalis does that a lot
Yeah
i increased the saturation to show off what i mean
it annoys me how azazels outline is dark red but his hair is pure black but thery did a really lazy outline shit on it
nvm, got it
<@167363485326508033> do you know anything about how curses are stored? I'm assuming it's a 4 byte int within the game object
eh! Didnt know the bot would post this here lol

**PC &gt; Console Mod Converter** *by Red7s*
I figured you guys could get a use of this as well since I saw a few of you trying to get 3ds mods ported as well :) https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2297/pc-console-mod-converter
**Link** http://redd.it/5260g1
haha nah I didnt pay attention ?
yea bad wording on my part sorry lol
oh
batch
?
you said you wrote scripts to automate stuff?
but
if converting is simple
well, that should be simple to automate
^
No programming was involved. Id kill to know progreamming lol This is honestly just a matter of converting the files to a format the vita understands. Which thankfully is a widely available format for PC games (PCX)
how did you learn programing? ?
still this is really cool
Even a mod loader :p But one thing at a time lol The big struggle atm is sharing the mods. Im getting a ton of downloads on the ports but not as many people are aware of em
that'd be neat
its a bit tedious atm
If I had the skill I would love to get this method into an executable or even a better batch file so that you can just drag and drop and it will do everything you need. I think that would increase the activity in the vita isaac scene a ton
No converstion needed
Music is just drag and drop :p
Made a few batch scripts to automate a bit too :p
my mod should be simple right? ? its just a music mod heeh
haha nice
I have it down to a science now lol
that was quick ?
ayy

Ill grab one of those and hte title then. Thanks. Just waiting for the FTP queue to clear. Its trying to transfer 1500 files for work lol
shops will look like basement rooms
gotcha I can find a shop easily
bedrooms
it changes arcades and shops
What rooms does it change grpahically? Ill hunt for an arcade if I have too but if I can avoid hunting for that it would help lol
and changes item pools
it jsut removes rooms
The majority of the mod is "behind-the-scenes"
It doesn't.
Does it change items rooms or anything? I havnt used it. I cant gurentee an arcade spawn lol
LIke the arcade, for example
One of the graphical changes the mod does.
Once its on the vita what do you want to see photos of? I assume you will want more then just the titlescreen :p
On it
Rebirth.
Which would you like to see? :p
<@!66197463593136128> Rebirth or rebirth nocosmetic?
ur mod sux
;P
wink wink
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/73/the-legend-of-zelda-music-mod
Yep :/

Ill take a look at classic mode in a few min. Need to finish this modpack install for work
and if it depends on anything Afterbirth uses that's that
It's possible to port Afterbirth mods but it's such a hassle
Yeah
? That will make things easier then. I  can port afterbirth mods(did with the binding of pokemon) but they make things 10x harder lol
its in the zip next to the AB version
source: I made it ?
yes
(havnt opened the link)
Does it have a rebirth version  <@!66197463593136128> ?
link me and Ill try. Gonna attempt classic mode first
nice
huehue
port my mod :>
PC
That brought some good traffic to these vita mods
psst

I already like you just because of your profile pic so good job

hehehe
<@111742218133307392> thats the goal :p
and the game will still crash
It takes 20+min to make one change
Im sorry about your luck <@173420370773147649> I have a 3ds with A9LH and a capture cards and I cant get isaac mods running on it for the life of me
to befair, you GIVE a reason to have vita with this ?
It removes all Rebirth (and Afterbirth, if enabled) content
haha
<@190963577681608704> https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/2255/the-binding-of-isaac-classic-mode

well, yeah, I'd need one
?
heheeh
jk jk
I feel sorry for u
<@!66197463593136128> link me to classic mode?
>having a vita
You just need another 3ds that has A9LH
not easily but you can
And i dont want a hardmod
You can downgrade that
I'm on 11
<@190963577681608704> Can you try porting Classic Mode now?
and then do modding
What fimrware?
to get cfw
He needs a downgrade so mods will work again
Well, I'd need to downgrade to firmware 9 first
I need another mod idea now lol I got most of the big ones I think

What do you need for 3ds <@173420370773147649> ?
^
but
the pain of waiting for a soft downgrade for 3ds is still there
yo nice job
I don't have the Vita version but good work
port isek pls
?

and i assume burning basement would be 2

and so on
3-4 are caves
1-2 are basement
as for the floor numbers
alright, thanks
8 bit
and right after it there should be a floor alt number
there's a floor number, starts from 1 at basement 1 and goes up as you advance
like is there some kind of enum for The Basement, The Cellar, etc.
<@167363485326508033> can you give me a brief description as to how the floor information is stored? I don't need offsets or anything, I'd just like to know what to look for if that's possible

And that, my friends, is what's

And while it will sound like shit and climpering
just like me
he can try
You really think isaac can play something like, say, the Hush theme?
I grew up in a musical family and all I could play when I was 5 was a super basic melody with one hand
lol thats gay
when I was 5 I started playing keyboard
isaac is a 5-y/o boy though
no
add me to special thanks
no
add me to special thanks
So in terms of music what are you going to do
<@173420370773147649> you always need to ask yourself "can a baby play a keyboard"
cross-shaped dicks and dicks with halos or horns, probably
yeah, that's actually not too far off
^
draw dicks
"What would little babby Isaac do?"
You always need to ask yourself
A child doesnt know how to do that
And then I'll convert it to midi
add me to special thanks
and shittily record it
I'm gonna attempt to play the Isaac songs from memory on my rickety keyboard
RIP
I'm gonna do something better
nah
Will my midis still be there
oh this meme
But the most important question
thats your alt account portal isnt it

at least I dont like to chew it like portal does

no u
fuck you
I already did that though :^)
looks like i will have to make the shitty one
fine
in the relative sense
nah, I'm actually trying to make this remake look like a child's drawings rather than a sweet bro & hellajeff comic so I'm actually trying to make it look good
the shittier the better
no dont do that
and move the right wing a bit
probably gonna make the ink splash smaller

it's reaferberts++

maybe after release of reflash.

well
you just asked if i can do that, not that i am supposed to do that ?

<@174193097285173250> can you make keys sparkle like they did in flash
its honestly fucking amazing how their entire team is idea guys and they still need to resort to reddit for more ideas
so is this also going to have a shit arg with material stolen from dhmis
more like 3
they are probably 13~
i wouldn't be rude to them
I'm really tempted to comment and say "can you people even guarantee the API is good enough to implement even half of your ideas"
like there's a finite number of good ideas for a game like isaac, just go to the "item suggestion" threads edmund made
every article and reddit post ive seen about this mod has just blown my mind as to how much you can write about absolutely nothing
maybe they can team up with the one guy who wanted the binding of isaac poop logo
got 'em
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hey verybody, this is an informative, but at the same time a self-advertisement post, but, don't run. Just because it's (nearly) shameless self promotion, it has a purpose:

Hello! I'm Lucky, and I'm taking a break from my mod. Not because I can't do the project, but because I'm waiting for Afterbirth+! My characters are complicated, each monster is different, and will feel different than the other monsters (by "monster" I mean "character")

how does a number quantify as too much
there are people who watch game theory

yes
yes

a ga(y)me theory
thanks for wanking
http://pastebin.com/MYDnuJnj
a gay theory
but that's just a theory
kek
Yes
game theory: isaac is ness????
And he's a demon in the mirror in the cathedral ending
That is very true
in the mega satan ending
ISAAC'S MOM
and isaac turns out to be a demon
including...
she is the mother of all demons after all
no
i mean
lilith is isaac's mom confirm
attacks children
Noun:
in ancient Semitic folklore: a female demon who attacks children
<> definition lilith
Could not find word.
<> definition lilith]
neko futa
>any futa = no
yes
no
lilith futa
ye
You've seen the conception items
nah they just poof
given isaac being a kid he probably imagines lilith giving birth through a dick
but whatever
yeah we're overanalyzing this
who cares it all happens in isaacs fucked up mind anyways
sure she's problably given birth but that doesnt prove anything
how do you know lilith isnt a kid
Eeh
Or even less coherent
It does tho
Then it should look like isek
She wouldn't know how to draw if she's blind would she?
Well she's still blind
So it wouldnt be child scribbles either if she drew it
But she's also not a kid
Yep
it all makes sense now
cus she blind
that's why it looks so bad
oh she drew herself onto the character selection menu
maybe lilith doesn't know she isn't white because she's blind
when in game, her hair is actually brighter than her skin
yet lilith appears with bright skin and black hair
racist
azazel is all black
skin color inconsistency bothers me a bit too
Noun:
a male demon believed to lie on sleeping persons and to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women
a situation resembling a terrifying dream
someone who depresses or worries others
<> definition incubus
the incubus is ugly though
Expand the blindold by one pixel and it looks fine
or well, the place where her eyes should be
like, her eyes are so high on her face
although tbh the afterbirth one doesn't look much better
it does look super weird
i'm looking at it again today and fuck
at 1 AM
also fuck, i thought it looked nice yesterday
im gay
thats what you gets
i knew u were gay
this is unacceptable
argh
now i can't unsee the penis head
damn you guys
,
penis
Ciirulean plz
>dick around
?
we don't dick around when peni are involved
I was just trying to figure out how I could ruin the sprite for him
say what you want about lilith but back off the circumsized
I still think his Circumcised picture is just Isaac wearing pants super high
it is the opposite of an improvement
the second one looks like she has a penis head and crumpled wings
the old one looked great
<@167363485326508033> what did you do to the lilith sprite

there u go

**Mod Available for Non Steam Game** *by Geenigmaticguy*
Hey searched and couldn't find anything so please bear with me if this has been answered already.

I do not have steam nor will i have steam in the future. I do however love this game and able to download the game (rebirth+afterbirth) all ready to go from IGG. 

I can run the game using isaac-ng.exe

Yeah
that's some really high hipster pants then
damn you
He's wearing pants
oh
Kil I ruined it
Or pants
le mao
Also his body looks like a sideways pacman
So basically it's jewish isaac
I wanna see that in game
Beautiful.
best character in the game

nothing will beat this after all
Honestly Lilith sucks. At least, for me she did.
Keep it; it describes her character perfectly
penis hair
damn youuuuuuuu
i see it now
oh my god, the hair
i dunno if i'm the only one who is bothered by how god awful Afterbirth is
hmm
She is a weird dick
she looks like a weird dick
can't help but notice how bland his design is though
and for good measure

Thank you ?
Not that I know of, but <@174193097285173250> is the man to ask about that.
Is anyone able to provide more information about mods such as "external item descriptions" by chance? Im looking to try and get it working on the Playstation Vita but am hitting a bit of a snag. Does it have an essential file that other mods with custom animations(like the binding of mario) do  not have?
And missed the opportunity when the first few people started reporting it

ok
Ill tell you tomorrow!
Id love to, but Im not sure I can
thank you <@111742218133307392> . if you want, you can beta test that mod tomorrow ?
awesome job with it man
also cant wait for you to release that mod wof ?
yeye
Yeah, they're saying it's an authentic WotL experience basically
are
they clearly ate saying they didnt need a mod to play classic
it means theyre playing wotl
what does this mean ? what am i supposed to answer ?
¯\_(?)_/¯
¯\_(?)_/¯
why are there 2 different versions of cains  eyepatch
wait
And of course adjust the item rarity system
If I were to make that I'd completely change the AB alt floors to have a custom set of enemies and rooms
That's why this is based on Agony
I'm pretty much trying to make a proper DLC with my own twist on it (for instance the golden boss doors)
topkek
<@173420370773147649> ok i'll make every item special
I might eventually throw a modpack together via mod collection on the site, and a compatiblity library so these things actually work with each other
Now you just need to put in an item rarity system
Thats what afterbirth shoulda been
Congratulation!
It's working fine in my custom Agony build
Also I got the golden boss rooms ported over to rebirth ?
As far as I know.
Didnt it use the same method that I used for classic mode?
Looking back, it was rather simple though
Back in the day I thought that was black magic
Now I remember what heartless was
Ooooh
wonder how he's been
havent talked to him in ages
I gotta talk to jean again
Oh man
He made the Heartless mod, didn't he?
the legend
Jean-Alphonse
Haha
wasnt too important anyay
And how nicely he stole Jean-Alphonse's fairy fountains
oh well
Not really
i dont suppose there is a way to make brimstone half one color and half another color is there?
Minecraft rotten meat as an item sprite is a genial idea
Nah
you're joking right
http://www.moddb.com/mods/isaac-the-lost-lamb/news/isaac-the-lost-lamb-release
This is what afterbirth shoulda been
I'm not trying to make another Afterbirth here
Why
There was also one that turned every special room into item room
saw that one
So basically godmode's item rooms but not hitler
Ah
It turns treasure rooms in to a boss room, but you get double the items out of them
What does the mod add anyway
and agony stuff occasionally
and replacing the afterbirth content with rebirth stuff
Regardless I'm also isolating the rooms that this mod added
it's 7
That's what I'm doing
just look in AB renovator what the ID is
Not too big of a deal tbh
yee
oh rip
Afterbirth version of Renovator works fine, though
Basement Builder crashes, too.
Just use Basement Builder
and it's the Rebirth version of Agony so
Trying to port the "gold boss door" mod over to my customized copy of Agony
What's the room type ID for item rooms?
Basement Renovator's dun goofing for me (the Rebirth version of it) so I'm editing a .xml manually
because of the c&d
yeah that's true
i can't do shit anymore
ye
hmm

you're good

Unless you mean the time
Also, I'd change 18.08 to 18.09 :D
yes. that will be fixed in the final version ? i still havend converted the pits yet
At least in the screenshots
The flooded caves pits and rocks in catacombs are off color

so it's basically rebirth without rebirth

what about new items

Nah, he's gone
so stuff like little horn is still regular?

no, only those wo are recolored classic enemies like the scarred womb variants
I think a release in 2 weeks is good, as are the screenshots <@174193097285173250>
The new ones that could not be removed due to techincal limitations are reskinned to look like their WotL counterparts
show one of those off
are new enemies reskined as well

one problem that I do have is that the .FromFiles() function or whatever that was called has analphabetical sorting where 100 comes before 2
I have a flowchart of the planned algorithm here
my code is just too messy
not really an issue
what's the issue
no
huh
Can't you just copy and paste it :p
and then connecting it to the icon processor
understanding what value is what in the item sprite randomizer logic
What's left to do?
I have the whole splitting and recombining part
oh
yeah, that part is already working
shit that doesn't work
item id % 11 * 16
to get x
top left corner
to get y
item id / 11 * 16
I think this'll work
I think
wait
oh
so I'm currently analyzing which value is which
but my code is confusing
yeah, I have that as well
which should be in the name of the collectible
is get the item id
what you could do
16x16
How big are each of the icons?
oh
No, I have that part down
and rotate them properly before that
I could split it for you
I need to split the sheet and recombine them in the same order as the items
oh
no, because the icons are saved in a sheet
can't you just do what you did with the item sprite while you're doing the thing with the item sprite?
oh
currently working on the icons part
wait so how far are you with the randomizer?
yes

We need a **real** clearer item descriptions mod
Fate, Spirit of the Night, Transcendence, Lord of the Pit, Holy Grail, and The Bible
Yeah, kinda,
do any items override the lost's body?

Is there any way to edit/create new items?
A program or a method or something?
I desperately want to mod this game, but I've only seen programs and stuff for making challenges, changing characters and spriteswaps
Thanks
**Link** http://redd.it/5127gq
gotta change the legsprites on the right
oh wait
i guess
got this
alright

break all immersion
break it
i go with the i m m e r s i o n breaking
do i break the i m m e r s i o n, or have an animation that looks like isaac is trotting
use a 3rd color
ok bye
oh
how am i supposed to show walking when i have only 2 colors
anyways, im going to sleep now. its 4 am now... bye bye
it's awful
my walk cycle is horrendous
oh man
just let me ship my computer to you
Noodle must've disabled it for ~~normies~~ typical users.
hold up
Huh.
i cant do that
but
i would show you a picture
i mean
nope. everyone should be able to do that
do i need a role or something?
no little upload box
there's no option for me at all
actually
it's like only for this server
normally, just drag the file into the window. that will upload it
why can't i post images?
yep. i wrote it myself ?
I assume you're using it for reflash
That's a thing?
Woah
thx man
k
this tool can help you with scaling. just put it in the same folder as any anm2 file you want to scale. for example making a spritesheet double as big, just type in 2 and it will rescale all anm2 files by the factor of two ?
see how that works out
i might make the sprite sheets bigger
If you stuck to being *close* to coloring in the border and used a more crayon-esque brush and a slightly larger size, it would look a lot better
idk
or im shit
i don't think there's enough space
ye
Didn't look very good, however <@160374167953342464>
sick
on the far right
that was one of them
beautiful
yeah
or maybe scribble like filling ?
can't post pictures
crap
k
That one's the dank one
Just make one slightly grey on the inside
which are green
and then those other ones
how am i going to distinguish dank globlins vs regular ones
but then again
But I assumed this was going to be an unofficial addon for it.
Yeah.
just so you know, the isaac's doodle mod isn't mine
Especially after looking at the mod's screenshots
Ditto
yea
i think the first one fits the most into the artstyle.
and last is scribbled in
one is colored border
one is colored inside
one has no color
or the link
are you talking about the first on the preview
i see
there are 4 if you click on the link
First one is my vote
ikr
they look like heart pickups
oh
this is a really fast globlin lump
for red hearts?
one looks like he colored it in
uh
which version should i use though
that isnt too bad
someone just look at that and tell me
so
since theres multiple types of globlins now
and i'm not sure how to do color
http://imgur.com/a/EGA9I
and i'm making it
i got bored
so
Ah, that one.
isaac's doodle
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/656/isaacs-doodle
let me find it
um
wait
no
Is it the binning off isek?
so question
because i'm bored
and i guess i'm doing it now
but it wasn't finished
i noticed that there was a mod that made all the sprites look like they were drawn by isaac
i'll just put this here in hopes that someone sees this
so
kek
fucking amazing
nice

**I screwed up the Greed Machine with Cheat Engine** *by Markyloko*
I downloaded Afterbirth a month after it was released. It's a pirate version, basically I can't buy stuff on Steam for... many reasons (hopefuly I'll be able to in a few months).
Anyways, I was tired of grinding the Greed Machine, so I used Cheat Engine and changed it's value to 999. After donating

ouya port or nothing
YES
port to ouya
mac version when
c
port to ma
¯\_(?)_/¯
dunno, if it works it works
:>
will there be a mac version?
but <@173420370773147649> ....
hm
wine likely
Well it'll still work through wine potentially
wpf is so fucking tied to windows they arent even bothering to port it
rip
i dont get why you keep saying that
o damn
or "no work on wine"
>At this point, no group in the Mono project has plans to implement Windows Presentation Foundation APIs as part of the project.
However, I guarantee you'll still get questions like "how work on mac"
.NET will work on Mac and Linux via Mono
Yeah
jerb said that a while ago I think when I started work
what do you mean
doesn't wpf inherently have mac and linux support?
nice meme
and ouya
hey port to mac
mac support
hey when are we getting a release pm2k
as I already said, when it has all the features I want it to have
except the rooms part maybe
also randomizer release when
Reply hazy, try again.
<@173420370773147649> And despite that AMA, I am still unimpressed.
i can tell
yeah, I'm bad at making UI
that one is a bit better looking
every one of those tabs up there is filled with that
http://i.imgur.com/sRsV6ko.png
I got that idea from the Pokemon Randomizer, which has like 10 different randomization modes for every aspect of the game
o shit
?
There's Options!
http://i.imgur.com/yVoNpDT.png
very basic lua apparently
but all the others we can already do
the animation one I can get behind
the modding tools seem pretty shit
https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/50wiwe/i_was_at_the_afterbirth_pax_dev_panel_ama/?sort=confidence
so azazel is the unique case
ok
no, its part of the character sprite
azazel's is to lord of the pit
is the lost's body tied to the sprite of the dead dove too?
crazy idea
i have an idea...
yea, the walking is a side effect of the flight
here is the used sprite
hmm. i dont know but it works just fine for me. only problem is, that he is always walking
if only i could post a gif of it
yes
you have to place more than one body in that sprite, right ?
kk
gimp
what editing tool do you use ?
in my editing tool i move it one pixel and it is out of place either way
i mean ingame
when i place it the body either moves to the left of where it should be or the right of where it should be
move around in terms of "wiggling" or what ? thats maybe due to false placement of the body sprites.
i dont suppose there is a way to make the lost's body static, is there? overlaying the sprite with a normal body makes the body move around and it looks weird
fancy

http://puu.sh/qXT3o/099b7d51b9.png
ofc i dont know what im looking for ever but details
ok
you can probably change anything if you know what you are looking for
i'm just interested in this, but can you change the ending videos?
idk where to find those particular files, and how i change that from anm2s
If you change the Death's Scythe sprites you change Death's Touch sprites
ill unpack the anm2s i guess
well i want to change the tears
oh
no. it will just change the sprite of the scythe
because azazel's body is saved with lord of the pit
i guess that makes some sense
if i edit them there will it change the tear files?
nvm
thats weird
wait really?
oh i need to unpack those separately?
actually you can find them in graphics/resources/gfx/Bosses/Classic/Boss_064_Death.png
so, where would i find the tear images for death's touch? i cant find them in the unpacked file or any other mod files. are they the anm2 files? if so what do i do to change their appearance

https://puu.sh/qW1aU.png
there is one thing i will say
anything else?
ah
you can leave out the braces btw
is this more or less beautiful
```if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1){Console.WriteLine(String.Join(" ", inputwords.Skip(1)));}```
o wow
oh I was missing a bracket
I want to make it a one-liner tho
leave it as that then i guess
huh
it did
yes
what
did ```csharp
if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1)
                    {
                        var echo = inputwords.Skip(1);
                        Console.Write(String.Join(" ", echo));
                        Console.Write("\n");
                    }
``` work
but how do I make it work
I mean it doesn't work
```C
if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1){ Console.WriteLine(String.Join(" ", inputwords.Skip(1)); }```
how does this work
wait
beautiful
```if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(String.Join(" ", inputwords.Skip(1));
                    }```
echo -f file.txt
what else u could do is
righrt
you can just do WriteLine in this case
```C
            if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1)
                    {
                        var echo = inputwords.Skip(1);
                        Console.Write(String.Join(" ", echo));
                        Console.Write("\n");
                    }```
oh I was doing it the wrong way round
wait how do you use it with lists
right
look up string.Join
o
```C
if (inputwords[0] == "echo" && inputwords.Count() > 1)
                    {
                        var echo = inputwords.Skip(1);
                        foreach (string i in echo)
                        {
                            Console.Write($"{i} ");
                        }
                        Console.Write("\n");
                    }```

nah
exit
echo
what commands should I do next
hmm
lmao
yeah
cause I'm a retard
ooooooooooooh
and that was false
```Console.WriteLine(input == "help" && inputwords.Count() == 2);```
I did this
uhhhmm
may aswell do `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<string, string> desc = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<string, string>`
wait
that's cause some random guy off the internet told me to
well still if you do using static
o right
that was pm2k
also when did I fetishize saving typing
right
you fetishize saving typing so much yet you do this
dont do `Dictionary<string, string> desc = new Dictionary<string, string>`
also for the love of fuck
though
but inputwords.Count() is 2
ah
it's the else if
the problem isn't even htat
print out inputwords[1] to see what it actually is pls
I am
you're not writing "help help"
what
but help isnt an argument is it
```C
        Dictionary<string, string> desc = new Dictionary<string, string>
                {
                    ["help"] = "Syntax: help <command> ---- Gives a description of the command, or all available commands."
                };```
well does the dictionary have any arguments
it's the argument for help
help
what is inputwords[1]?
```C
else if (input == "help" && inputwords.Count() == 2)
                    {
                        if (desc.ContainsKey(inputwords[1]))
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine($"{inputwords[0]}: {desc[inputwords[1]]}");
                        }
                    }```
now why does this not work :L
depends what you wanna do
now how do I work with these :L
whichever you prefer
or { "help", "something" }
ah
try ["help"] = "something"
but that didn't work
I tried ```{
                    "help": "Syntax: help <command> ---- Gives a description of the command, or all available commands."
                };```
how are they laid out
Dictionary<TKey, TValue> to be exact
lol
oh
literally named Dictionary
I know you're not jack
btw im not jack but yes
anyway are there dictionaries in c#
exactly
i dunno
see, now how would I know that?
you can just do `bool isCommand = command.Contains(inputwords[0]);`
portal shh im learning
```csharp
bool isCommand = false;
                foreach (string i in command)
                {
                    if (inputwords[0] == i)
                    {
                        isCommand = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
```
yw
god dammit this code already makes me want to kill myself swifttiger pls
<@88415148867358720> are there dictionaries in C#?
np
Thanks
ah
so you can see that ReadKey is the culprit
if you do Console.ReadKey(true) it won't display the key that is intercepted
it waits until a key is pressed, in your case that would be the first letter of the next command
why does it do that?
<@128874748041101312> it's because of your ReadKey call
ReadLine is returning the omitted version for some strange reason...
I can try
<@88415148867358720> Can you help me with that?
This should probably go in <#220581404612886528> but whatever
eg ```help
help
help
help
elp
help
elp```
it omits the first letter when I type something twice
but for some reason
This is what I have so far ```C
while (true) {
                List<string> command = new List<string>
                {
                    "help"
                };
                List<string> desc = new List<string>
                {
                    "Syntax: help <command> ---- Gives a description of the command, or all available commands."
                };
                string input = Console.ReadLine();
                string[] inputwords = input.Split(' ');
                foreach (string i in inputwords)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(i);
                }
                bool isCommand = false;
                foreach (string i in command)
                {
                    if (inputwords[0] == i)
                    {
                        isCommand = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (isCommand == true)
                {
                    if (input == "help" && inputwords.Count() == 1)
                    {

                    }
                }
                Console.ReadKey();
            }```

I would imagine it might be an issue at 100 ping
The latency when testing across two different networks wasn't really an issue, however that was with 30-40 ping
<@!66197463593136128> Yes. The networking library that I'm using also has built-in latency simulations that I'm going to be working with pretty soon to improve stability

**Creating a Retexture Mod?** *by nicematt11*

<@88415148867358720> Great progress. Have you tested across two devices that are not on a local network? From what I understand latency is the largest issue here

**Is There A Way To Remove Afterbirth Content From Mods?** *by Red7s*
I'm looking to convert a few of my modded rooms to my PSVita and 3DS however due to this I can't use any afterbirth content(enemies items etc)

Is there a way that I can purge all afterbirth enemies at once? Or do I need to go from room to room with Basement Renovator?
**Link** http://redd.it/50k9c7
Why is the first one there anyway
Before the first
wait which one
right
You can omit everything before resources <@128874748041101312>
The only bad thing about it is that there are two resources folders
literally why
`IsaacRandomizer\IsaacRandomizer\bin\Debug\resources\resources\packed\graphics_unpack\resources\items\collectibles"`
also that is the worst folder structure ive ever seen
or that
or you could just add a slash in the destpath
beautiful
`File.Copy(file, $@"{destPath}\{Path.GetFileName(file)}", true);`
aha
fuck thats supposed to be two backslashes
GOD DAMNIT
I figured it out
replace it with destPath + '\\' + Path.GetFileName(file)
hold on
hm
yeah it doesn't copy onto the collectibles folder
well it copies but
doesnt work as intended
k
see if it copies
try and put some png files in the source
works for me
```csharp
string destPath = @"C:\Users\portal\Desktop\IsaacRandomizer\IsaacRandomizer\temp\items\collectibles";
            if (!Directory.Exists(destPath))
            {
                Directory.CreateDirectory(destPath);
            }
```
wat
i just ran the folder creation and it made the directory for me
Yea
i assume by create the folder you mean the destPath one
lemme see
or create the folder
it doesn't copy
what doesnt work here
o
not work
```C
            string sourcePath = @"C:\Users\chapa\Desktop\IsaacRandomizer\IsaacRandomizer\bin\Debug\resources\resources\packed\graphics_unpack\resources\items\collectibles";
            string sourcePath2 = @"C:\Users\chapa\Desktop\IsaacRandomizer\IsaacRandomizer\bin\Debug\resources\resources\packed\afterbirth_unpack\resources\items\collectibles";
            string destPath = @"C:\Users\chapa\Desktop\IsaacRandomizer\IsaacRandomizer\temp\items\collectibles";

            string sourceFiles = Path.Combine(sourcePath);
            string sourceFiles2 = Path.Combine(sourcePath2);

            if (!Directory.Exists(destPath))
            {
                Directory.CreateDirectory(destPath);
            }

            foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(sourcePath, "*.png"))

<@162156525337575425> help
that's what the guidelines say anyways
mmm
that's how c# does it, a file for each class
and then import the classes as needed
i imagine it'd be something like, one file per class
and import each other
no matter the language it's not acceptable
makes maintenance a pain in the ass
you'd want to create multiple files
but it isn't the best way to do it
but surely shoving everything into one file can't be healthy
like, i don't do python so i don't know what's acceptable or not
so eh
it was compiled
well
that can't be the best way to do it
about basement renovator being crammed into a single file
gay
what do you think
legit python question
alright
otherwise it wont work
you should remove those
there are also still a couple of references to my exact PC folder structure in the code
```python
import random```
<:PopeFresh2:214445447874478080>
mmmm
also atleast C# using is better than the cancer that is #include
looks cleaner
takes more time to type tho
I wish it was a namespace named qt
how come
really?
I hated that
end of the story
no stupid namespaces to deal with, you see a class name that starts with Q you know that's a qt class
at least qt did that well
I never really used any
yeah
but most of the time they are cancer
there are very few cases where namespaces are useful to have
i generally avoid namespaces like the plague
I think
c# doesn't allow importing conflicting namespaces
tho
it is
it's bad
figured
yeah
well that's basically what using static is
never
no
do you do using namespace std in c++
but not when they are fucking abused
namespaces are okay
no
well
besides i think namespaces are evil
can only import namespaces that way
thats what I mean
yeah okay that's stupid
it throws an error
not work at all
doesn't work
does it just
what happens if you omit the "static" part
it's a recent feature
that's stupid
it doesnt work otherwise
because idk
why explicitly specify "using static" though
it's like a namespace class tbh
is that like c++ namespaces
the class has to be static for it to work
the fuck is a static class
why is winrar named "binding of isaac: classic mode" in my discord
static classes
<:utCuteGote:209734206719393793>  < my face when i pretend to know what any of you are talking about
static classes functions or classes static functions?
<:utCuteGote:209734206719393793>
static classes*
<@167363485326508033> basically importing a classic classes functions into the global namespace
do you know python kilburn
like, why do you even have to specify it
what the fuck is this using static shit
@pm2k yeah we are misunderstand
show off douche
pm2k#6214
Playing Binding of Isaac: Classic Mode
I'd have to create an instance of it at the beginning of Main thingy
you're not <@162117085428842496>
If I didnt make RandomNumberGenerator static for example
<:DscHunk:217605686832529409>  are we coding
ughugh
I think we're misunderstand each other tbh
thats why I use it
yea
you don't create instances with static classes
but
it just feels wrong
I dont want to create an instance of every goddamn thing
whats the problem with static
nerd
thats too annoying
but then I have to type that every time
calm down grandpa
idk maybe it's me being old and grumpy but using static pisses me off
why does that work now
nothing just do Class.Function()
What else should I use if it sucks?
<@162156525337575425> Just noticed that I also use the "using static" stuff. I need those because I want to use methods from the respective classes
but dont steal etc
thank fuck
calm down
I'm gonna send it you
the more nooses the more killing right

but i like fucking code
don't do that
;-;
pls
with it
i just want to fuck
pls
just send the full fucking code man
sorry i slammed my head on the keyboard
<@173420370773147649> post some pics of your code for me to laugh at
jumnik, kkkkkk
just kill me
idc
I'll kill you for using Python
thanks
kill me
fuck me
rip
i thought you said completely corrupted
oh
me or who
what
you're not corrupted by Python yet I have faith in you
hell i wont even send it to you if you don't want it
that shit is all over the place
you don't have to use my code
pm2k don't send pls
also its a mess
I freak out if I dont know exactly what does what
i legit want the code
kill me
pls
why
that was joke
no
<@173420370773147649> you gojna send me the code or what
so
k
nothing???
what should i use instead
tell them to fuck themselves
so i did
some guy told me to use it
what
it's dumb
you shouldn't import a static class like that
see
what
I know
no
If you dont put the static there Visual Studio gives error
some guy told me to do it
what's so bad about that
don't use it?
is there any way to avoid it?
wait
what about it
oh
as in using static System.Console;
what
the using static import
I mean
what would you use instead of static? legitimately curious
oh god
YES
extern static const volatile unsigned long long int
bad
because i dont know what any of it means
literally why
also using static
yep
not like he'd want to you probably have infinite useless input functions
its no like he has to use my code
don't do that pm2k his code is ugly
thank
<@173420370773147649> srsly pls send code so i can work on it
ye Java is shit
all i know is that i had to learn java back in college and it sucked
it's very good
<@173420370773147649> send cod
it's probably a decent language
but it doesn't look bad
tbh i never needed to use c#
im fine with that
no
ok
but I'll take all credit obvsly
is it bad that I like both c++ and c#?
only extremely gay people use python
theres something to do
I will
ok
<@128874748041101312> you can make my entire program for me
its gay
<@167363485326508033> what do you think about python
i guess
it's like java except less ugly
<@167363485326508033> what do u think about c#
do not learn c++

he got a c&d from nicalis remember?
no guys kil isn't working on an api

give me ab+ early access
is ab+ your blood type?
nice
it's ab+ footage
is this your leaked lua modding api console
you do

who knows
maybe not
maybe

Heretic has cool ones but I'm thinking more along the lines of Gungeon; ones that lie dormant until you attempt to open them
I'd love to be able to make proper mimic chests
True
that's something, right???
and characters that pee
you'll be able to make at least mimic hearts
ye
i think there's still going to be some lua support
and we know that range ups can be added
with lua!!!!
you can modify the tables
Well we know for a fact that new characters can be added
lmao
lel
inb4 they just rewrite the current XML "api"s capabilities in lua and call it a day
If not for AB+ than for Kil's API if he continues it
?
thanks
use the gun emoji
I'm more than positive someone's going to work with Sag to make her alt floors a reality anyways
just make it text based
tthanks
for russian roulette
someone make me a gun asset
I can already imagine all the apologists
well shit if this actually happens it's going to be hilarious
gg
nope, just burning basement
tyrone even outright teasing them
promises of topheth and sag's other amazing floors
you're right
the more likely it sounds
and the more we talk about it
yes
didn't we jokingly come up with this
i'm not even sure what to expect anymore, it totally sounds like something nicalis would pull off
it is
that's going to be the funniest shit ever
but if it does happen
lmao i'm so sorry for even suggesting this in the first place
they're just content content content
also even if they do scrap it they're going to stay silent about it until release
and most probably dont even know it exists
they wouldn't lose much at all if they decided to scrap it
want is the keyword
well, a lot of people **want** to use it
and even then that's an optimistic percentage
i'm pretty sure the lua api would be used by less than 5% of the community
besides
they'll praise nicalis for blessing us with more content
and we'll have fun with your API
they forgive too easily
that's the thing
and then forget about it
but is it
hhaahahahah no
the community is going to blow up
I mean it is definitely very odd
if that actually happens holy shit
and decided to scrap it or add it later
i'm going to laugh so fucking hard if it turns out they deemed whatever spider made not viable enough
complete silence
and all of a sudden, nothing
a bunch of little shitty scripts
at first they started showing off their lua stuff a lot
it's kinda odd though don't you think
well fuck
it's most likely going to be part of the game
and not as a mod
i remember tyrone said there would be a stat display like missinghud a while ago
i doubt it
but it implies it's made as a mod right
I mean probably
like the extra hud
there's nothing that says that's lua
yup
could be hardcoded?
yeah but why would've they shown that missinghud ripoff today
they hardly talked about it at all
as in, scrapping the lua api
the more i think about this the more i feel like nicalis could actually pull that shit off
fak
went to my friends private voice channel,sry
back
yup
meaglovania is just a remake of a shitty song he made for a shitty hack
ye
leitmotifs slapped together
its like the new ab+ song
meh
hopes and dreams is bae tho
megalovania is shit lol
megalovania is overrated
I agree
fight me irl
sans is trash
undertale sucks
now with 60 fps
make undertale 2
more seriously tho, make a small game in unity or something
<:HFhype:212613706213883904>
yep
i killed him
he's gone
rip appa
also learn to code
scratch is best game engine
silence, non programmer
^
use scracth
no
how about you man up and use c++ instead
I ALREADY HAVE
code a gun and shoot yourself with it
ARGH JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO CODE :p
i dont know something for you ?
and I want to program something in C#
I'm bored
do you have anything for me to do?
yes but those can be extracted from the flash game. so the only challenging thing now is to compose the spritesheets
but you still have to do the vector image, right?
?
nice
my new script is so useful for my flash mod ? it upscales the anm2 files automatically ? no longer edit the things per hand
i didnt know heretic had custom ones for a while
nope
who actually plays the custom challanges in mods
I am top kmodder
ok ill add challanges to my mod
we are kmodding
yesw
are we kmodding
what are we doing here
really simple
I just need to fix a couple of paths
I have that part down
yesyes
I forgot
you can do something
instead of putting the full location
the thing
do
you can
if you tell them to put it in the packed folder
btw
god damnit
mmmmmh
i could just edit the xml
nvm
in order for the randomizer
some have 4
some of the backdrops have 6 wall templates
look
they are
what
can't you just tell them to put it in the packed folder
turn all the backdrops into a universal format
if you want
I have a non-programming task
hey
I gotta fix the whole file shit first
I'm dying here man
pls
eh
<@173420370773147649> if you don't give me something to do i will 1v1 you in minecraft

mine is chinese now
what the fuck

yeah
still doesnt work?
same thing for me
nope
then it logs me in
and same in register
`passcheck = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(sha512.ComputeHash(passcheckbytes)).Replace("\n", " ");`
both
When logging in or registering?
yeah i got it to work if you strip all newline characters from the strings
do it again :p
register?
what did you do
http://i.imgur.com/h0ll0eS.png
on mine it's not even saving the username
huh
the generated string likely ends up with a newline character?
Why is it saved as 2 lines?
`string password = hashes.ReadLine();`
wait what the fuck
well then you're only reading one line
It should be 2 lines
and you read only the first one so it obviously doesnt work
the password i tried is saved in hashes.txt as two lines
Yeah?
atleast part of it
yo i think i get it
ill try running this myself see what happens
huh
but it just adds it back on
I tried to substring it to get rid of the first 3 characters
second one is password
first one is passcheck
it gives me ```?GG??fq?^?{&Ö???FOC?R]JW]??Qy?^4??w?*z*????;?"f??

how doesnt it work? does it give you an error or something

well then
`New post from /r/themoddingofisaac`

**Isaac Menu Font** *by TheSwiftTiger*
I don't know if anyone has made this yet, but I went ahead and created a .png file with all of the letters from the Isaac menus, and created some special characters as well. I hope this'll be of use to some people. I don't know how to create a font, so you'll have to copy and paste the letters yours

yeah
afterlife?
uh
you're doing that other mod, right?
then 4 - 6 months for release
probably 1 - 3 months for beta
we have like 15 people working on our mod
interesting
Over 150 items, at least 3 new final bosses
Oh, I have no idea,  but I'd give us at least 6 months,  due to the amount of features
for you
For me of for him?
how long do you expect development to take once ab+ comes out?
with all the currently planned features
hi i have a question for you
Well it was so hard to come up with ...
the name, I mean
where'd you even get it
Add *
We're also planning to afd ultra wrath in our mod, coincidentally
Oh, ok  I might use it for inspiration,  if so I'm allowed.
I dunno
she might still allow you to use it
it was meant for that originally ?
welp we're gonna use it for our mod
I think i could use that for something.  I'll ask permission to NYS later
no it's act zero bomberman
yes
It looks amazing
Is this ultra wrath?
rip

Kinda like the PKMN randomizer
Have multiple options
I'm actually just gonna include both versions
As in the stage names are sorted into categories like "building", "womb-like", "yellow" etc
Should the backdrops be fully random or should they be a bit consistent with the stage name?
Anyway
downloaded with edgy
nvm
mozillas malware detector geos off
cant download the zip
public
you should maybe upload it somewhere
that would probably be useful to a lot of other people

oh wait you can already do sprites
yeah
I guess it would be possible **somehow** but pretty difficult
But could you actually put it on the image file?
that would be cool, yeah
Yeah
you mean the hand-drawn names like characters
ooooooooooooooh
and it actually shows up
I mean so that you can randomize the names
well, dunno, start a graphics mod
But what can you do with just a font? :p
eh, I dont know, would make more sense as a standalone mod rather than in a randomizer
It's hand drawn so it's gonna be kinda difficult
you know the character names and stuff
I mean the Isaac menus
Well, for the menus I wanna use the standard windows font but you can make one for the headline and labels and stuff
ok
I'll make a font that you can use in the menus
k
im suing pm2k
Let me make a font
tl;dr rip off my editor
yeah
As in, give them 1 random start item, half of them get a random active
?
characters
oh
Randomize players?
I guess you could try and do some xml parsing to randomize players if you want
anyfin else? ^^

that seems pretty doable for me
try to get creative ?
the description should be some nonsense sentence

ah
the name should contain one uniqe roman number from a list of 20
You could make a card description/name generator
Is there any way I can help? I'm extremely bored right now :L
Starting to get comfortable with the File IO
use ricks unpacker to unpack them one by one
then it will copy the packed files from your isaac directory
It detects the isaac directory (thanks <@174193097285173250> !), then you can check what you want to randomize, you press the randomize button
good
Making steady progress
<@173420370773147649> hows it goin
Seems like Ricks Unpacker is open source according to the license.txt, so I can just include it in the program and use it that way
yeah
But requiring the user to download the unpacker separately and then just navigating to the directory would also work, right?
Can't find info on the license of Rick's Unpacker anywhere
thats the code i use in my mod loader
Thanks!
RegistryKey regKey = Registry.CurrentUser;

            }
<@174193097285173250> Then I'd be interested, yeah
yeah that's no good
Yeah, you need to own the game, but you can't release the original assets on moddingofisaac
wait, you can't do that
oh
well, I planned on just shipping the packed stuff with the program, since you need to own the game to download it anyway
you could just tell em to put it in the packed folder
<@173420370773147649> do you need code that automatically selects the steam folder of isaac ?
because that would be a tiny bit user-unfriendly
and my exact folder structure
I'm cureently making it so that the program doesnt depend on my hard drive
ok
<@173420370773147649> how's it goin
o ok
just gonna get saved as that for now
If you want to contribute possible stage names for the generator, here's the place: http://piratepad.net/pzI3Z6Svxe

jer, it was hard enough with python
It needs to markov chain
it needs to make pseudo-intellectual bullshit
The random card description generator is going to be interesting
its stupid
in python
eh
like ughh
i still cant get over the fact that they capitalized `True` and `False`
it is for me
not something to be proud of
>2k lines of python
http://hastebin.com/abinuzocis.py
hey at least I made something with almost 2000 lines
gay
this was my python code
```python

num = 100

while num != 1:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        num /= 3
    else:
        process = input('+1 or -1?')
        if process == "-1":
            num -=1
        elif process == "+1":
            num +=1
        else:
            print ("That is not a valid process.")```
nope
does python not have a switch? i dont rmeember
yeah that works
```csharp
switch (Console.ReadLine())
{
    case "-1":
        num -= 1;
        break;
    case "+1":
        num += 1;
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("That is not a valid process.");
        break;
}
```
so you dont have to make long if/elseif statements
oh
basically a quick way of checking whether a variable has one of various possible values
I don't know what that means
if that helps
it's like case in freepascal
the quickest way to get to 1
it's a small game
what is the point of the program?
hold on a sec
what the fuck is switch
else write num, read input and if the input is -1, num will be 1
```C
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ConsoleApplication10
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int num = 100;

            while (num != 1)
            {
                if (num % 3 == 0)
                {
                    num /= 3;
                    Console.WriteLine(num);
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(num);
                    string input = Console.ReadLine();
                    if (input == "-1")
                    {
                        num -= 1;
                    }
                    else if (input == "+1")
                    {
                        num += 1;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("That is not a valid process.");
                    }
                }
            }
            Console.ReadKey();

        }
    }
}
``` fixed a little
else if num is 3, tell the player he won and end
would look better imo
in the last else statement
if num is divisible by 3 divide by 3 and output num
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/06tc147t.aspx
what
you can just do `switch(Console.ReadLine())` iirc
while num is not 1
num is 100
you're looking at shit
shit
oh god wtf am i looking at
yay
yay
random pills work
"Jugendstil Up!"
```C

                    break;

            Console.ReadKey();

        }```
this was almost exactly how it was in my Python code
wow
give me a sec
I'll post some bad code
wow
the xml is saying "xD"
oh god
http://i.imgur.com/wKHAJqi.png
wow
and I have a randomizer fetish tbh
remembering the item IDs
you know whats actually a pain to do with a tool?
like version 4
the random function was added wayyyyy later on
because thats a pain to do without a tool
why
the random function is okay
well okay
REEEEEEEEEEE
tbh i initally made it for myself so
welp, at least I'm not making a program for noobies who cant edit XML files
post bad code for me to make fun of
I'm mainly cleaning up my program to make way for additional functionality now
Not right now, sorry
<@173420370773147649> anything else I can help with
unless you take a deal
90% chance for angel room, and 10% for devil, whenever on of them is generated
like really op
unless its really good
reroll
but I'd liek to know your opinions
sorry for the off topic question
would you take an item which makes angel rooms more likely to appear, or would you reroll it?
i think yes,
Is Ricks Unpacker open source?
<@173420370773147649> the hardest thing for random rooms is not the randomization, its the converting from .stb into xml ? in c#
It will have file dialogue thingies later
Im just testing currently
Yes
It's also incredibly messy
you need to fix that
Including the M drive
It requires you to have my exact folder structure though :D
hell, I'd even play it right now if you gave me the exe :p
I'm currently brainstorming a room randomizing algorithm
I could imagine that
but yeah <@173420370773147649> a randomizer like that would make the game way more interesting
?
it hasn't been installed since I formatted my computer 4 months ago
Do that
<@173420370773147649> with the thing you're making I might play Isaac again
Well
True.
ur mom
What's a destoryer?
ok
ye
ok
See ya
well
aww
Its getting too late
Sorry, I'm gonna do the rest tomorrow <@128874748041101312>
thankerino

should work
91000 instead of 4000
sure
do you want an even bigger list
sec
<@128874748041101312> could you send the nouns again plox?
yeah im a complete retard when it comes to algorithms so
with position and entity id for the current char
for each char add the xml thingy
skim the array
etc
saying where its at
would be easiest to use the same thing it does
I think by an XML node
dunno
then just make a different algorithm for every level
btw what are they represented in the stb files?
verbbbb
char is -127 to 128 i dont think it'd be enough
as an adjective alterative
VERB-ing
sure
oh
do you want verbs
emojis are multiple chars in one
oh I also have verbs
just use emojis
probably
do you think there'd be enough chars for each?
that represent enemies and rocks etc
plz quik
array with chars
but first I want to see this adjective generation
sure
or just use algorithms that make sure that certain conditions are satisfied ?
clearly what you need to make is an AI that plays isaac and test each room if its possible to beat
and then transfer that to the stb file
use a roguelike level generation algorithm to fill an array
nevermind
would be
A stupid way that would work
its def possible but yeah
Just really really complicated
I guess it is somehow possible
yeah it'd def be complicated to avoid impossible rooms
a cross between the doors has to stay free
but it would be difficult
you could
I wonder if I could make random room generation possible in a creative way
yep
good
fat, sad, sexy and gay aere all on the list
oh boy
?
I can't wait to see what monstrosity forms out of this

this is just too perfect
^^^^
uhuhuh
that item makes you spill milk
gj mayn

W O W
xD
<@128874748041101312> sure
ohohoh

ohohohohohoho
oh
do you want adjectives as well
thank
hi
wat
<@128874748041101312> yo your word list is fucking great
why does this make so much sense
monstro loves listening to fat midis on his radio

it's definitely a dildo
it's a dildo
i dont know what to think about that

looks like a red croissant when its sideways like this
zucchini most important stat
raw liver has been turned into a gourmet meal
oh no
it makes too much sense

oh fuck
better than fingered tbh
this is like fingered meets isaac
I guess
but your employer wont like it
its thrilling
if you piss on a croissant at work
deeper than godmode already tbqh
there is so much going on in there
and make a lore
lets find hidden meanings

lmao
counter force
that sounds like a competitive smash technique

and being gay is sinful
it's a sweater that makes isaac cry because it makes him feel gay
that makes too much sense
gives you a tears up
sign me the fuck up
AMAZING
that makes even more sense
this is incredible

well
oh
nice
it even makes a bit sense sometimes

yeah, it crashes all the time
that thing is just a meme
Implying you don't just use the isaac corrupter on every run
True
>not randomizing before every run
I would love that, because what makes the game boring for me now is no new content, and since I'm 1001 I have no goals either
You'd have no clue what does what, you'd have to learn the entire game again from the ground up
Still better than No Man's Sky
<@173420370773147649> I would happily abuse the hell out of a randomizer like that. Make the game fresh every time ?
thats useful
"Yellow descriptions"
Isaac starts with Eden's Brome
But only make then red or blue or black so it'll be Godmode
godmode simulator
then it will be no mans isaac with 18 quintillion procedurally generated floors
recolour it
choose from a random premade backdrop
sure
and card pictures/names, while we're at it
will it recolor stages
And stage names
sick
yep
will it scramble the item pools too?
Idk
Curse of the Maze++
So basically
so you have no idea what you picked up most of the time
scramble the menu icons
It needs a baby randomizer to he Nicalis, yeah
Scramble item charges and a few item types
needs more co-op babies to be a nicalis dlc generator
It'll eventually remove all costumes
nicalis dlc generator*
Edmund McMillen Item Maker Simulator
So what's the point of this?
hot
ohohohoho

amazing

should spice it up enough without completely breaking
maybe just a few of them
prooooooooooooooobably not
I dunno if just randomly converting actives, passives and familiars between each other would work without breakin the game and rendering half of the items useless
Next up is randomizing descriptions and item charges
rip isaac character editors 2nd place ur gonna overtake it with this amirite
"Monstro's Funny Closet"
sick
YESSSS
yessss
"organization of sports"
"the black voice"
this is good alrightt
"Bob's  Opium"
oh my
yup
"???'s Big Tube"
figured it out
yeah have fun learning how to read xml files
ah
get every 'name=""' in the document
what do you mean by get every item
I could just google it
but how do I get every item in items.xml
yeah
where x is the total amount of items in items.xml
create a List<string> of names and generate x amount of names for it
now I just need to somehow repeat that for every item in items.xml
its starting to work
"Eve's Evil Cursor"
http://hastebin.com/ucezilesej.coffee would probably work didnt test
that'd actually work
so it's even more compact
now make it read the names from a file
h-hot
I'll stuff you in one line
i have a fetish for stuffing everything in one line
y u make me feel like shit
wat
http://hastebin.com/quwujoduha.vala
<@128874748041101312> fixed ur code ;^)
ah
for a bit of consistency
if its there it gets replaced with a random "up" or "down"
I want it to look for "up" or "down" between the name tags
well
thanks
wat u gonna do
aight
Just gonna edit it a bit
So could I just use the word list array and a part of the algorithm in the randomizer?
even though it was extremely small
Anything else? :p
That was actually a fairly fun project
Isaac now looks like this
``Mariachi Up!``
see, it's useful <@162156525337575425> >>>>>>>:V
I see
Converted that into a C# array
No
just random word generation?
http://www.desiquintans.com/downloads/nounlist/nounlist.txt
Python
Mine would have been too small
how did you get the word list?
yup
those actually sound like pretty cool pills to me
`Automation!`
good job!
`Control Up!`
o well done
`Turtle Down!`
`Nylon Down!`
http://hastebin.com/bilebuhicu.avrasm
done
before you need to write `Dictionary<int, string> dict = new Dictionary<int, string>();`
get used to it
why
`var rnd = new Random();`
also for your own sanity
^^^^
C# is almost plain english tbh
thats like calling java low level
shit
>C# >low level
Why am I so bad at low level programming
you only need `modifier = "something";`
right
you're declaring a new `string modifier` instead each of these
```C
string[] words = new string[4307] { "aardvark", "abacus", "abbey", "abdomen", "abolishment", "abroad", "etc"}            
            Random rnd = new Random();
            int choice = rnd.Next(0, 4308);
            int choice2 = rnd.Next(0, 3);
            string noun = words[choice];
            string modifier;
            if (choice2 == 0)
            {
                string modifier = " Down!";
            }
            else if (choice2 == 1)
            {
                string modifier = "!";
            }
            else
            {
                string modifier = " Up!";
            }
            string complete = noun + modifier;```
post code
That throws an error
and then assign something from inside the if
you can have a variable above the if statement
i mean
what
you cant
they disappear after the closing brace
How do I access them elsewhere
Yes
<@128874748041101312> you mean variables declared inside one or what
yup, there you go
What's with the scope of variables in if statements?
correct you cant
dunno if you can do that with arrays
you can do list.add and stuff
arrays are p simple
lists have a bunch more methods
wait so what's the difference
but so can `dynamic[]` so
it can if its a `List<dynamic>`
he means if one list can have objects of different types
what
what do you mean
lists can have different types of stuff right?
right
fyi
sidenote lists and arrays are not the same thing
nevermind
you know when accessing list elements
seems like it for now
would probably work
I meant "string[] nouns = { };"
sorry
and msdn put it as an example
try it
because I'm trying that
not sure
is var words = {}; also legal
if you wanna go hardcore, just `var words = new[] { ...`
also you can simplify this to just `var words = new string[] { ...`
nevermind
wait what
that was an error
but
that wasn't it
no
oh]
likely not related but do you have a semicolon at the end
`` string[] words = new string[4308] { "aardvark", "abacus", "abbey", "abdomen", "abolishment", "abroad", "abyssinian", "accelerant", "accelerator"}``
etc throws error `Syntax error, ',' expected`
where the fuck do I need a comma
single quotation marks are for `char`
you need to do `"strings like this"`
right
are you trying to make a string with `'these'`
>character literal
what does that even mean
``Too many characters in character literal``
ah
4308 of them
because I'm going to use an array of nouns
why such a weird number
prooooooobably
does C# support arrays with 4308 elements
But you want a simple goal
I'm probably gonna make my own version of that anyway#
gay up
then generate a random string with either random words, "X up" or "X down" depending on the input
just check whether a string entered through an editable field (name of the original pill contains "up" or "down"
you dont have to do xml stuff
like a simple pill name generator
you can try and make something for my randomizer if thats okay for you
even if you have an idea on how to do something but its complicated, google it because someones probably done it in 1 line
set yourself one
and just google if you have absolutely no idea how to do something
I just want a goal
I have
even if its boring
Well, that's why you should at least read up on syntax and the basics
write shit and experiment until the program doesnt crash
but then I'm just going somewhere without any knowledge of where I'm going
yes
there you go
just do trial and error
cause yeah, reading tutorialspoint is informative, but it's also boring as fuck
someone give me an interactive way to learn
idk lol its some new cancer
how the fuck do I get rid of the black thing
now i approve
http://i.imgur.com/DyH2rBF.gifv
guys do you like my program
use WPF you shill
whaaaaa
enjoy your outdated cancer ;^)
I can do what I want
fuck you
no
stop trying to learn C# immediatelly and go back to python
yeah
what do you think
form1
yeah it is
atleast i think this is from windows forms

nice meme
http://i.imgur.com/CCcSitw.gifv

you feel fat
or "you feel greasy"
descriptions just have nonsense stats like "coolness down, memes way up"
stuff like that
<@167363485326508033> yep
or just randomize the costumes if that is somehow possible
samson's rotten bra
and the costumes as well
yes
the icons need to be made invisible
yeah
i like this
well couldnt you see the items in the pause menu

hahahah
hey pm2k remember when I tried to markov chain with the bot
With name presets
I'm definitely going to make a name randomizer next
i just got back from Insomina
sausage up
the names may be too short
i wonder if it'd be possible to go overkill and markov chain the item names/descriptions
lol
change the colours god damnit
noice
nice
god damn
dont you see these cool new unique AB+ items
I see what you're doing here
oh
what
this is more than just neato

found it
where's the fucking toolbox
but yeah seriously theres nothing better than visual studio
no it's more like comparing a book to an ebook
nice meme
Sublime Text is photoshop, of course
<@173420370773147649> comparing sublime text to visual studio is like comparing mspaint to photoshop
there's a plugin for that
guess what
oh wait
lol
hey but it's better
means it's 0/5 :^)
it doesn't compile anything
welp
I think
Sublime text doesn't compile C#
YES

hi

heck
http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3923260/boi.txt
True
because of people complaining that rebirth has a different artstyle
I think it was jsut included as a joke
There are so many better than the one they used
Honestly why didn't they just use a better filter algorithm
I didn't try it with the filter yet
Yeah
if a bit blurred
And the filter actually looks okay
yup

our school mascot is this bad boy
Might still say it
Hell the Google search used to be bugged, it would say our mascot was piracy when you Googled the school
lol
oh
But our school mascot is literally a pirate
its obviously evil
it has pirate in its name
Even then of all the things to block why the hell piratepad?
I'm pretty much the only reddit user from Saxony so it isnt blocked in our school
wow
NO MAKING FRIENDS ALLOWED
Yet reddit probably has more "adult oriented" content than deviant art and it's blocked for "friendship" content
True
tbh its a good thing that deviantart is blocked
All run good seamless textures I could find were on deviant art which is blocked for "adult oriented content"
Last year in game design (we had a different, actually competent teacher) we had to grab some assets from the internet
Actually
Yes
because ours is that good
<@!66197463593136128> But is your school filter good enough to block the sites which your teacher tells you to use for your task?
Dat burn
thats what i told you last night

not big enough

**Editing entities2.xml messes up game** *by Ackermannin*
Well I just started modding and I changed some entities in entities2.xml and for some reason the game is starting to crash more often. Additionally it seems like Burning Basement is more rare I went through 10 seeds and no BB but when I too entities2.xml out it was more common. Whats going on? Also

**Isaac Character Creator Question** *by thebully222*
I'm trying to make a mod involving Bumbo, is there a way to give a character the second, third, or fourth form of Bumbo from the start?
**Link** http://redd.it/5025vq
I'll test it as well if need be  <@174193097285173250>
yes ?
I guess I can just keep the gameplay and sfx parts of Classic Mode enabled and itll fit pretty well
your job would be to play some rounds and write down everything thats not converted / looks weird.
yes it is ?
ohh
I think it was a continuation of ReFlash?
what is the mod project about?
Sure thing
kk. you can test it tomorrow, too ?
I would if it werent so late :(
anyone here that is bored and wants to test a new mod project?

yea I don't know how to explain it pls
could have some `help anim` or something to explain all of it
`anim: Syntax: anim*loops* *animation* Description: It's complicated. Ask TheSwiftTiger for more info``
sidenote
just use presets ez
gameoflife is hella cool but typing it in literally gives me cancer
but it depends how your bot is layed out
why does no one like gameoflife ;-;
8ball pls
so i gib permission
especially eval pls
it's open source
actually
It would be better to add a few of those to robo bb
but does it sound good?
I need to get some things worked out
don't add it right now
actually
```eval: Syntax: eval ``math`` Description: returns the value of a Python math statement

smh
no need to have 2 shitbots
i approve of this
because I don't want my precious SwiftBot to be tainted with memes
also responds to every appas message with "post sprites"
which will go on this server
called ShitBot
the only thing we need is a bot that replies with "we know" every time someone says "im gay"
I'm going to make another version of SwiftBot
unless swiftbot spams same its a bad bot
guys delete

it's the USA law system what do you expect
We sue them for missing the opportunity to sue
¯\_(?)_/¯
how does that work
for double the money
and then we sue the ones who originally wrote it
first we sue the ones who copied
lol
problem solved
he'll just tell the jury everything the other party is saying is a meme
of course i should be

Yes.
Do we sue?
There ya go

well played
tfw you just want to learn a language but accidentally expose plagiarism
wow
or 2013
2012
Now we just need to find out when the tutorial was made
downloadmorewam.com
although RAM would be
so finding a cheap motherboard isn't an issue
Just found a $50 LGA 1151 mobo
2011
Personally, i haven't had problems with this thing at all, games run fine, newer games run slightly less fine
tbh the C# keyword table might've been ripped straight from msdn
1 sec
uhm
Yeah but then finding a cheap motherboard :/ and decent ram
Look when the book was released
C# keyword table more like english dictionary at this point TBH
That is here the question
Who copied whom
Beats the A10 in every mark except for core count and int speed (and the int speed difference is negligable)
shit even the C# keyword table
maybe their C++ tutorial is literally the same but in a diff language and your book copied it
wow lmao
Here's an i3 that's three bucks more than the A10 I linked http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i3-6100-vs-AMD-A10-7850K-APU/3511vs2937
except replaced with C#
Some of the stuff on there is directly on my C++ book
Regardless, you should have gotten an i3 for the same price. The hyperthreading will give it 4 threads which most games like nowadays.
yes
you know the tutorialspoint tutorial
what the fuck
Yeah, that's the g3258

Its dual core 

I personally dont want dual core because alot of modern games require 4 cores, i would rather be able to keep the CPU for like 2 years at least, and upgrade then , than have to upgrade to a quad core only a short while after I build the damn thing
nice

<@162156525337575425> ez
Honestly, yes.
Would you rather a dual core pentium?
whaaaaaaaa
<@162156525337575425> you can tell discord to syntax highlight
<@128874748041101312> woah how did you do those colored strings what is thi smagic
Issue: quad AMD core.
Quad core.
Well its the a10 so
atleast its better this way imo
ah
yup
```C
            Console.WriteLine($"Length: {length}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Width: {width}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Area: {GetArea()}");```
is this how you format it
Even if the APU isn't at fault.
Regardless, you're going to be CPU bottlenecked. Hard.
And they perform better
Not true
The modern Intel chips have just as good of an integrated GPU as the APU's do
you played yourself
I have one, but only because i was on a tight budget when i built the PC
it's marketing fluff
there's no point
hell why would you get an APU at all
Online
?
why the hell would you get an APU and an R7 240
edgy
with a knife
in visual studio theres a red square buttom
nevermind
how do I kill the program
wow
And not even a good APU, it was an a6
well meme'd
He seriously made that gaming PC with an r7240 and an APU and complained when it couldn't run DOOM
its good
what
format strings like this
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn961160.aspx
here
tho
That was what was causing the error
I know this guy at my school who idolized Austin Evans
dont bother with {0}
Yep
do you have visual studio 2015?
when dealing with string formatting
I'm used to not needing the 0 in {0} because of python
ah ok
yeah I got it

ofc im joking lmao

about the linustechtips thing
no
there's nothing wrong with it really
look at the link
please tell me you're memeing

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229043(v=vs.110).aspx
look up C# naming conventions it uses both pascal and camel
What's generally accepted in C#, PascalCase or camelCase? or just all lowercase with underscores
Sorry, am idiot
aka Linus Tech Tips, the person who wrote linux
yeah
Linus Torvalds?
ye
implying C is possible to maintain
C is okay
and somehow
like it's "hard to maintain" or something
i've seen the weirdest arguments against c++
god i still get triggered whenever someone brings it up as a legit argument
nice meme ?
we must use c
he must be right
so surely
linus torvalds says c++ sucks
but
nowadays theres almost literally no reason to write C
Ok
dont listen to them
NO
So i started with standard C, cause my mentor told me to
just go with C#
almost all c++ tutorials are shit too
Learn C# first ?
don't do that
yup
But i hear that was a bad idea
C++ is also quite different from C# though
eeeeeeeeeeeeh
Was thinking of jumping straight to c++ because alot of people say that language is great
gg wp
<@162156525337575425> It's just throwing a null reference exception now, so I've given up for today
C# is best language
Trying to learn it
Im horrible with C#
High-level ones at that
if all you know is dynamic typing languages
C# is way different from Lua and Python
Normally most programmers start with Java
^
yeah then you should do a beginners tutorial just to get shit right
RIP
heh
Oh
Ill be surprised if he doesn't
Nope
And you might as well start from the beginning to learn C#'s basic rules
any experience with java?
Repetition helps me understand things easier
Python and C# are incredibly different
a bit of lua
Because if you don't know the syntax, yeah start from the beginning
Python
I have to all the time, i dont have the best memory
Wait <@128874748041101312> what languages are you accustomed to?
just not the syntax
Like I have the logic in place
you'd get bored after having to "relearn" the basics again
^
that is incredibly boring
Start from the beginning and relearn everything to refresh your memory?
damnit
not that im aware of
¯\_(?)_/¯
hey let's switch up the topic, are there any C# tutorials for people with some programming knowledge
Just because it isn't as popular doesn't mean RIP
Gungeon is far from dead
Made many (including me) aware of the genre in the first place
thats why they decided to throw off any remaints of balance for le broken synergy runs xD
Gungeon died after like 2 months
sadly yes
Isn't that what Isaac was, though? The rogue lite that brought the genre to the masses
............
Um
The biggest bad thing it did was drive Rebirth's balance further down the drain. The game is too easy, there are far too many good items. Almost every run ends with the player being overpowered, bosses like Isaac and ??? pose no threat. The game is just so easy it's boring.
Another disappointment was that the DLC didn't actually introduce a new path, but rather an admittedly pretty cool but disappointing midboss.
Okay, I've compared it to Flash Isaac's DLC, WotL and WotL was infinitely better. It introduced a good ratio of bad and good items, introduced two fully fleshed-out chapters, alt floors with complete sets of rooms, a shit ton of new bosses and completely unique enemies and it didn't completely soil the balance (although Rebirth already ruined it in a way).
Look at Agony of Isaac, a player-made mod. It looks more like an official DLC than Afterbith. That's quite telling, if you ask me.
Greed Mode isn't balanced in any way or form, you either get good items on the Basement and snowball from there or you barely have a chance to get past Basement, it's also incredibly grindy
Sacrifice room rework was one of the good things about AB, I agree
There are a few items but most of them are too strong, uninspired, straight up pointless and they all throw black hearts at you
The bosses and enemies are simply reskins of existing enemies/bosses or have far too simple movesets
One of the main negative points are the alt floors, the absolute epitome of wasted potential. The alt floors are all literally reskins with no unique themed bosses and there are only a few non-reskin enemies. 3 out of 4 alt floors have literally no unique enemies, they are all reskins with slightly edited movesets.
It introduced further neutral pills, which were already completely pointless in Rebirth, a "Fuck You" to the game's balance
Here's a list <@173420370773147649> made over on /r/bindingofisaac
get pm2k over here to write some paragraphs
we def do
We need to sticky the reasons don't you think <@162156525337575425>
its literally a mod made by amateurs
Whats so bad about AB?
die hard fans cry because their game was ruined in favor for complete shitters who have no rights of playing a roguelite in the first place
but for the most part it has so much wasted potential
It has some good moments
I like it
Well, guess I'm not a die hard fan then :<
Afterbirth is a bad mod
^
die hard fans dont play afterbirth
I wama see this final ending, and 100% the game, and then im done
Such as myself lol
Well, yeah, I guess not, I meant more for the die hard fans
afterbirth+ wont bring back many players
get with the program
Isaac died a while back
^
isaac is already dead
I wasnt saying it was
@Sky(Sky) Don't think that's a bad thing, though. Edmund is best when he's reinventing genres, he blew everyone's minds with SMB, then with Isaac, I'm glad he can move on but that he is making sure Isaac doesn't die
<@162330617416122368> for the most part
its like 18 different planets in every rgb combination
Ab+ is basically Nicalis giving up and saying "balance it yourselves"
i dont think even nicalis could out-recolor no mans sky
more like afterbirth+
No mans sky, more like one mans lie
As in not procedurally generated content i mean more ACTUAL content, like what they promised in promo material and interviews
$10 early access would be acceptable
even at $20 its complete shit imo
It also needs more content
But it's a $20 indie game being sold at $60
That's my consensus. If it was cheaper, it wouldn't be all that bad.
Id say 7/10
But if it cost like $30 instead of $60, it would be wonderful
I dont think its great by any means
I honestly think it is an alright game
Eh,
Tbh i actually enjoy the game
<:DscSucc:218693871691890689>
No Man's <@162330617416122368>
Its going alright
hows it going ?
hello sky!
Hi freind
sweet
yep ?
He might do what pm2k did and just clone the normal floor overlays for the alt floors
ive overridden burning basement with all its variants with the normal basement animations ?
sweet
True
it will go perfect with the Classic Mode mod and the Classic ISaaac music mod
what you gonna do about the new floors though?
thats awesome
yeee
Looks good so far
I can't wait for that mod to come out, it would go perfectly with the Classic Mode mod
Ooh
flashy isaac mod now supports bombs ?
and `$` for string interpolation if needed instead of adding them
ok
yup.
so I dont have to make double slashes?
btw always use the `@` for file paths from now on
you're welcome kid
thank you very much
*sigh*
yep
now do you get why it doesnt work?
after adding it becomes M:\Paul\collectibles\edited\M:\Paul\collectibles\collectibles_281_punchingbag.png
yep
are you printing JUST filenames[currentfile]?
its random every time
see
M:\Paul\collectibles\collectibles_281_punchingbag.png
as long as you see what it is
doesnt matter make it a messagebox or something
Maybe try it anyways
<@162156525337575425> as in, print it to debug?
no idea why it was changed in AB
can you print out whatever the fuck `filenames[CurrentFile]` actually is
I had that error before and did what I read on StackOverflow: Add the IO path combine thingy
<@173206704849158144> and i'm on rebirth
Which is weird considering Rebirth doesnt do this
<@!160981982849794048> Also it appears that the hurt grunt files are registered under a "Player" folder
Yep, again "The given path's format is not supported."
see if it still crashes
try `@"M:\Paul\collectibles\edited\" + filenames[CurrentFile]`
yep
and with `$@` it crashes right?
that's weird
<@173206704849158144> ahhh, i gotcha
i mean not filename
filename is "{filenames[CurrentFile]}"
The file it saves then is 1KB big
<@!160981982849794048> Apparently the game only registers the Mom's Heart/It Lives (and possibly Mom's foot) sfx under a "mom" folder within the sfx folder
without a filename right
in edited
yes
yep, just double checked
if you do it without the $@ where does it save, in edited?
are you sure you have that directory spelt right
Alright, I found it out
huh
If I dont include it it only saves one file without an extension named {filenames[CurrentFile]}
<@162156525337575425> If I enter the string with the "$@" it throws an System.NotSupportedException
i'm having a similar issue with one of the hurt grunts
Thanks for trying, then
odd, i'm not sure why it won't play
and replace it with a string like `$@"M:\Paul\collectibles\edited\{filenames[CurrentFile]}"`
.wav
16-bit, too
yes
<@173206704849158144> did you save the new sound as filter death 1?
get rid of the whole io path combine whatever non sense
alright try this
Yes
does the filename have a .png at the end?
The filename that the picture which it's currently processing is supposed to be saved under
yeah, please, ignore my question
...
what does `filenames[CurrentFile]` return?
yup
do you have the folder "edited" created?
yeah ok <@173420370773147649>
Uhhh
k
Throws the same error
btw what if you try `ImageFormat.bmp` if that exists
It seems to be filter death, but when I tried it out it isnt
thanks
ill look into this
@here what is the Mom's Heart death sfx?
None of the solutions from StackOverflow have helped
Anyone has any idea why this happens?

<@173206704849158144> absolutely beautiful
uh huh
sounds fun
Scrambling the filenames
Now comes the hard part
always try to cram as much shit in one line as possible ;^)
ye
I should go back and change the others
ah ok
I've already noticed that a second ago when I was making another random check, so yeah
would look better imo
you can just do `if (RandomInt(1, 100)` in all those statements so you wont have to repeat the `chance = RandomInt(1, 100)`
random rotation is now a thing
http://i.imgur.com/gn0wv0D.png
a thing for binding of avalice
v v v bad
also this shit uses inappropriate naming conventions for C#
yeah, it teaches the very basics of programming, which is always a problem with beginner tutorials
going thru tutorials point may be boring then
dont you already know some programming
before pm2k sent that link
teach me
would you want tutorialspoint to teach me or a person to teach me?
think about the children
I was about to say
before my internet shitted
but should be good for beginners
doesnt use string interpolation, outdated/10
the lua tutorial from that site is good
no idea
lets see how bad this tutorial is
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/ <@128874748041101312>
o shit
tbh id love to be a programming teacher too bad i cant explain anything for shit
get on your knees ill teach you alright
I'm still learning myself
<@162156525337575425>
teach me C#
I gotta change that
its still useless though
thanks
hey you did it good job
here you see an AB+ item
http://i.imgur.com/Etrqu1U.png
Fuck yeah
The random recoloring system is working as it should
yw i get off on fixing others bad looking code
thanks
overlooked that one
oh
oh yeah and get rid of the whole `System.Drawing.Imaging` thing, its greyed out
then im happy
and in the very top add another new line after the `}` and before the `private void...`
happy?
done
k
please indent the bottom `});` by one tab
I just havent bothered renaming them
I know its shit
tho
yay
awww besides the shit naming scheme for buttons i dont see anything wrong ?
i hope i find something to make fun of
code review time squeee

Ah
And if there is no steam api available it just returns the 31st of December, 1969
it'll still use the steam api
It's pretty easy to patch yourself
well I hope nobody sends me such a drm-free copy, because that would probably be totally illegal
What happens with a steam stub patched copy (so it's drm free)?
Now we know that on thanksgiving of this year everyone will have the more options effect in their runs
At least we can predict the future
https://i.gyazo.com/63e8ef9716c5821b1d411a4deaebfce5.png
Steam is still returning the correct date even in offline mode
ye
I'll try going into offline mode to see what happens
yeah, I just checked. It is making some kind of call to the steam api to get the current date
alright
not that i know of
sidenote have there been any new costumes since then? i ignored everything isaac related after that
is it? i thought it was just a daily that gives you a different costume
ignore me
oh wait that was a daily
instead of being a daily it's an event that happens on a specific date
idk
what about that
Could be an event like iwata
i feel like it has tob e a daily tho
if it's an easter egg and not a daily that's peculiar
yeah easter egg wise
ah k
oh wait
<@162156525337575425> You can't do dailies offline
does it fallback to system time or just do nothing
it actually might be getting it from steam, I saw some calls to steamapi before the call to the easteregg function
what if its not connected to the internet
so that people don't cheat by changing the time on windows, i mean it's not much but it prevents people who don't have asm knowledge
like why the hell would the time be serverside but the events themselves clientside?
yup probably
which makes it even dumber
I'll bet it's serverside
because when I change it on windows it still returns august 27th
i'm not sure where it is getting the system time
that sounds seriously weird
is one of the options not buying AB+?
yeah
yeah, on thanksgiving of this year everyone will have more options!
did you?
at least one of them
alright I figured it out
nah
AFTERBIRTH+ RELEASE DATE LEAKED?
november 24th of this year
was there any special daily that day
... which is thanksgiving
there is a reference to november 24th
im too ashamed to have people on steam see me play isaac
fugg
it'll open through steam
i dont feel like risking it
does anyone know if you can just run the isaac .exe without it opening thru steam
wait what
because when I faked my date to match one of the conditions, it gave me the more options effect on every run
<@162156525337575425> it's not dailies, it's definitely some kind of easteregg
right
<@162156525337575425> you're forgetting who developed this game
idk I'm really confused reading through this, it does a lot of random multiplication and strange stuff
yeah my most likely guess IS dailies even tho it makes no sense why any of it would be client side
Pretty sure november 1st is supposed to be october 31st
I think they put this in and forgot to account that this year is a leap year
true
I'm starting to think that this is bugged
dont feel like ruining my 7 month streak of no isaac
even though it will take all of two seconds
I dont have a PC right now
don't feel like it
^
obviously the answer is to change your system time to that and then launch the game
Now it does
¯\_(?)_/¯
¯\_(?)_/¯
<@173420370773147649> that doesn't work on mobile btw
Regardless. 10:27?
Yeah, I saw that too
Aside from that
Apparently 3 news station guys got shot on that day
no date specified
Tyrone was born on May 27th according to twitter
Ed was born in 1980.
why would it be included?
Already looked those up.
even then
Neither.
Maybe birth date of either Ed or Tyrone?
That's a rather specific time, don't you think?
okay that does sound strange
That's odd.
also there is a reference to april 12th, 1982 @ 10:27 AM
and it probably is being used I just don't see it
november 1st is all saints day so I'm assuming that is the reason for it being there
blame nicalis
it didn't take a different code path so I have no idea why it is getting the time structure for november 1st
im changing my time to see if anything happens
it is getting the time structure for november 1st (a tuesday?) 2016, the 305th day of the year
uh okay so I found a new thing
i wish you could perfectly decompile c++ then none of this would be difficult...
There are _definitely_ a bunch of eastereggs relating to date and time though
it would make figuring this out a lot easier
I wish IDA wouldn't be so difficult
huh thats weird
did I just find a bunch of eastereggs?
reverse engineering intensifies
okay i just tried return value 0x10 and it is giving me the "more options" effect
as i said try starting a run with them as isaac, see if it gives him anything
oh wow
there are 20 different return values...
ill just make it return different things for now to see if it does anything
the whole function returns a different value based on a bunch of different conditions, these conditions are based on the date
maybe some scrapped feature
haven't seen the easter date used, but that might be if the year meets a certain condition
it's not very clear, but it is definitely checking the year with a bunch of different numbers and calculations
does it then proceed to do anything with the easter date?
not really sure what the first function does at first glance
right
it passes the year to 2 different functions, the second one being the "get easter date from year"
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rtref/gmtime64.htm
it calls gmtime64, which returns a pointer to a tm structure
im looking into it
so umm what does it do with the UTC time
i was wondering cause of the syntax colors
plus I'm a pleb who prefers CE
it is, last time I tried opening isaac in IDA it was a garbled mess
the function calls mktime64 which returns UTC as time64_t
btw is that screenshot from cheat engine or am i dumb
alright
i don't have afterbirth installed
well
i don't have afterbirth
<@167363485326508033> do you want to see the function that I'm talking about? I can give you the offset
then again modified players.xml works with dailies so
i'm assuming that the switch statement following the call uses the date, let me analyze this
arent those server side?
couldn't it be for daily runs?
but does it do anything with said date?
okay so it is called at runtime to get the date for easter
...thats strange
because there is a reference to keeper.a in a switch statement following the call to get easter
not that i remember
was the keeper associated with a specific date?
i suppose
let me see if it is called first
change ur system time to easter and start the game and see if theres anything special?
https://i.gyazo.com/e72724fcf3f13545d1555fba7447d1c9.png
cause iirc christmas makes you start with santa hats right
hmm does easter have any similiar event to christmas
does anybody know why?
a few months ago when I started working on isaac-multiplayer I noticed that there is code in afterbirth to calculate the date of easter for the current year
basically
C++, also known as C for short
yeah he's pretty terrible
another golden quote is "C++ is a walk in the park"
cringe
i said lua shit so the kid thought its because its too hard for me xd
probably
does he make programs in html
daffy "i have 15 years of C++ and java (short for javascript) experience and my favorite langague is lua" bebe or something
who is that
the roblox kid?
and we don't need any more tyrones running amok
have to check
O+ won't work
dunno
Or O+?
Is it O-?
Nonononono
And my blood type is 0
I'm back
inb4 the roblox kid interjects for a moment
eh any of these are still better than lua
i'm getting vietnam flashbacks from prolog
brainfuck best obviously
i can kinda imagine a few situations where prolog would be useful
oh god prolog
but to be completely  honest
also, prolog
kek
!
"OCaml is the most popular variant of the Caml language." Wow, so one person uses it.
Love their website
looks as bad as haskal
ocaml sucks
eugh its one of those functional languages
"b- but OCaml is free and open source"
yeah
OCaml?
i have no idea why that language exists
look it up
we had to learn a thing named objective caml back in college
definitely
clearly fortran is the better choice :^))))
gay
LIKE THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE
oh right
But if you're trying to develop on a computer it sucks
computer or tablet or phone, whatever
The point is that you can develop via touchdevelop on any device
notepad is my favorite ide :^))))))
¯\_(?)_/¯
or did they not want to add 10 more gbs to the installation
why didnt they just use visual studio
Well it isn't the language that sucks IT'S THE IDE IT'S GODAWFUL
looks better than scratch tbqh
Scratch is geared towards kids. Touchdevelop takes itself seriously.
;^)
have fun ?
<@!160981982849794048> http://touchdevelop.com
nothing is worse
scratch takes the unholy throne of shit
I don't want to know
oh god
yes
Did you just say something was worse than touchdevelop
more like gowang
better than golang
or touchdevelop XDDD
or golang XDDD
fuck
^ thats just C
more like C--
who needs a C++ API anyways?
xml is master race
xml api best api
Welp, kil, pack your bags
you guys ever played worms 4 mayhem?
wow
^^^
True
who needs exe modding when you have xml modding ?
spongebob
don't
the key to exe modding is
Same, mine's either a or b, maybe ab
i think the key to exe modding is being a masochist
i dont know its a or b something
Source: I spawned a Tyrone
i don't know what my blood type is
I know for a fact mine isn't
rip
i dotn think mine is O-
gross
oh fuck
If it isn't O-, you're going to spawn Tyrone instead of an EXE mod.
i sacrifice 30 goats on a daily basis
Put on a robe, be sure it's black, and kill the three goats. Mix it with your O- blood, then make a pentagram on the floor.
fuck 3 goats it aint worth it
don't ask why, that's just how it works
you are like baby
also your blood type must be O-
3 goats?
Then, you need three goats.
First, you need a subterranian altar.
It's easy. I'll teach you.
do you write ontop of a decompiled assembly or what
how do you nerds even do exe modding anyways
I guess I'll have to allocate my own memory
damn
all of my information comes from rebirth, the player structure probably changed a lot in afterbirth
that might not be true for you
no
no wait actually
there are two at 0xB92
there are a few padding bytes you could use, i suppose
do you know of any unused memory within the player object that I can use?
actually I think I know why it is happening
but still, it could be anything
That's true.
it's a little weird that it's specifically 0xFFFFFFFF
It just randomly happens when spawning a player
actually
I'm not even an EXE modder and I know that 0xFFFFFFFF isn't going to help ?
how are you causing the crash?
like, absolutely anything
that could be anything
<@167363485326508033> do you have any ideas as to what I should do about a crash in isaac that is overwriting the stack with 0xFFFFFFFF
i didnt even need to template it cause i only use uint32s with it but i did anyways to feel smarter
yeah okay no need for seeds then
oh
this is literally just for randomizing in isaac character editor
depends on what you want to do i suppose
eh fuck it i think it still works and i dont use a seeded one for anything
of course i am
o wait i think you're right
pretty sure you want to do `Random(std::time_t seed = std::time(nullptr))`
i pass the pointer to std time
`std::time` returns a `std::time_t`
yes it does
wait hold on
not a pointer
std::time_t you mean
it takes a `std::time_t*`
why nullptr as a default argument
but the seed function takes an int as an argument, doesn't it?
hm?
wait... what?
yeah i think `Random(std::time_t seed = nullptr)` is just more simple
either that or set the default parameter to std::time(nullptr)
i'd say
second constructor makes more sense to me
a second constructor or just take the seed as a parameter with a default value of null?
ah good idea
otherwise seeding with current time in the default constructor is okay
should have a second constructor that takes a seed as an argument
but eh
i think seeding it with time is bad
looks correct to me
yeah i had no idea what i was doing and theres like no tutorial on how to properly use `<random>`
nice rng nerd
http://i.imgur.com/471eYXo.png
whoever here understands C++ feel free to laugh
my c++ random code is actually pretty gay looking
I'm actally gonna do that real quick
yeah
also id just call it `RandomInt(int, int)` instead of number between but eh either works
lmao
yeah, I'm just never gonna look at the file again and be like "uh huhuhu I have an advanced RNG that is better than the normal Random()"
comments are still fucked but in your case id just delete them altogether
good?

I'm never gonna look at it again so why
yeah
in the randomgenerator?
yup, one of the tutorials I read said that as well
and fix the indenting please
well do that for every private member
hahaha

that was the guy I copypasted it from
thank you for using the underscore prefix on private members
tbh i just used `Random` so

trust me ive seen worse
the formatting is screwed up

warning
now post `RandomNumberGenerator.cs`
Didn't know you could do that
but yeah
thanks
now it works
try `using Image = System.Drawing.Image;`
i dont remember the syntax but
or System.Drawing
If I dont type it he doesnt know whether to use System.Windows.Controls
then replace `System.Drawing.Image` with just `Image`
I have it at the top
also am i retarded or do i not see a random number generator
and get rid of it in the code
add `using System.Drawing;` at the top
the random number generator?
i'm going to uncomment it soon anyway
tbh this isnt bad but some of this shit is redundant
^
`/* */`
i forgot how to do multiline ones
ugh that indentation because of the commented out `if`
yeah whatever
nice

THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!
which is just an online school at NCSU
Tagged the wrong jack ")
the AP courses are offered through a different school called NCVPS
here it's a normal subject that you can choose
<@88415148867358720> so is computer science like an extracuricullar thing for you?
ow
I'm in america so that isn't happening to me <@173420370773147649>
nope keep writing shit programs that read files into arrays uuuuuuuuuuugh
i wish my teacher was that understanding
But my teacher doesnt care anymore because she knows it bores me
i'm actually pretty glad my school doesn't offer any of the AP courses because now I get to leave early and take them at home
I don't do the assignments at all anymore
wew
I finish the assigment in two seconds and just play Gungeon for the rest of the period
for example geography or ethics
that they dont like
Well, in my course most people take it because they can replace other subjects with it
lol we're using "App Inventor" in ap computer science and it's just scratch for Android
they take it so they can learn how to hack the NSA
people who take programming classes are usually retards anyways
So maybe it's for the best
Thing is - the people in my compSci class even have trouble understanding the most basic concepts in FreePascal
you're not missing out
my school doesn't even offer any AP computer science course
oh god
oh god delphi
our book is old and about delphi
I'm not using the book but once I saw a question on framerate I went to the book to see if it wanted a "peasant" answer
only teaching outdated practices
my books are complete shit too
and the same books saying high end monitors and projectors go at 600Hz
oh lord
with the books we're using saying that most computers run at 30 frames per second
lmao
Hey at least it's not as bad as my game design teacher confusing java and javascript
So there's a chance
She's pretty cool
Wow
I might ask my teacher if I can install it
and my teacher is a complete retard who doesnt know how to indent code
lol
just C++98 my shit up
We have Visual Studio but we still have to use ROBOTC since it's got the compiler
yeah i have to use dev C++ in my school...
Computer Science would be more fun
I wish our School PCs had Visual Studio

kk
Hold on let me pull up some basic code
<@162156525337575425> It's not even the IDE that's bad, but their terrible excuse for a C-based language has a mind of its own
its cancer
Is it as bad as I think it is?
We learn FreePascal (Lazarus) at school
ofc its terrible
>anything but visual studio
<@!181224364388253696> oh
literally it's a terrible IDE
I only just realized what jerbeard64's profile picture is
although ROBOTC is cancerous
oh
We use ROBOTC for programming in robotics at school
also <@!66197463593136128> how do you know things about C# if it sucks on linux anyways
RIP eyes
post more code so i can laugh at it
I use light themes for everything
+1 dark theme plz
Because I'm edgy
I still feel accomplished even though it's completely useless
also why arent you using the dark theme wtf
*slow clap*
congratulations
Decided to try and make that since it would be easy enough
Now I have a random item picker
<@173420370773147649> basically
top botnet
its so fucking gay that even after closing the UWP apps their process keeps running
It limits a lot of things?
let me guess
just looked it up
I've heard horror stories about UWP and Quantum Break/Tomb Raider
^
if theres one thing ill give win 10 is that UWP is the biggest mistake they've introduced
But W10 Edition? C++. Have fun.
Because Java.
contrary to Isaac
Then again, Minecraft is very damn moddable even without an official API
literally why
oh god the win 10 edition
Then the whole "windows 10 edition" thing
honestly atleast nicalis will deliver even if shit
ffs
Theyve been "announcing" that since Beta
ye
three or four years ago
They pretty much pulled a nicalis with the official API didn't they? Mojang was like "yeah we're announcing an official API"
With ad.fly shenanigans, intellectual property and general slapfights
The modding community is pretty drama-laden though
I don't find the game itself cancerous, but don't talk about the fanbase
It's the vanilla game (and the vanilla fanbase) that's super cancerous
ftb is fucking great
That's why I played it a lot
Because honestly with mods the game isn't bad
you used to play non cancer minecraft a lot?
you COULD do `if (openFileDialog1.ShowDialog() ?? false)` if you want to look super edgy like you know what you're doing
I used to play FTB a lot
And yeah
I needed that when I was experimenting with old mods etc
ftb launcher
wait thrice
one is the new one
one is the old launcher
also <@173420370773147649> why the hell do you have minecraft on your taskbar twice
there probably is a better way but eh
Ok
cause `bool?` is a nullable bool
i guess you need to leave the == true then
oh
"Cannot implicitly convert type 'bool?' to 'bool'"
aaaaah
now I get what you mean
teaching you how to not make mac ports since 2015
portals C# tips and tricks
i really hated var at first but then i got used to it and now it looks weird without it
this is now #coding_help
^
same for `var bi = new BitmapImage();`
you dont need to type memorystream twice
It'll assume true unless you say otherwise
saves typing
Seconding the `== true` remark, that's what it defaults to.
`var ms = new MemoryStream()`
what is var?
oh yeah
you dont need it
leave out the `== true` comparison
I'm currently reading up on ColorMatrix
y tho
learn to use `var` and also
and save them again
Then recolour them randomly
My first goal is to make it load all the pictures in the collectibles folder
also yeah learn to `var`
Nah
Does it just choose a random item?
So, what's the point of this?
for your own good
please learn to use `var`
But the fact that I managed to make it load a picture, convert it to bmp, then to an ImageSource and then have the UI show it is an accomplishment for myself
im going to laugh at your code now
jesus christ
So far it's just a glorified image viewer
:^)
meaning you're one step ahead of <@162156525337575425>
That's nice
meaning it'll work on Mac and Linux
So it'll work on Mono
The instant I saw System.Drawing I was like "yep, .NET"
So yeah
Yep
System.Drawing is part of that, right
I guess
.NET?
dat c# tho
the farthest I've ever really gotten, in fact
so far so good
http://i.imgur.com/u070G6v.png
it could be anything
no, i'm editing executable memory within isaac-ng
have you edited an xml file ?
so frustrating
i've been getting a crash that overwrites the callstack with 0xffffffff so I have no idea where it's coming from
I'll probably just remove the strikethrough lines altogether
ah
So there arent strikethourghs over nthing
hardcoded
nah
Could I also use that to reduce the number of challenges?
like, if you really want to make it look good
you gotta modify the animation file too
the DOCTOR S rev
and more isek-y
except less edgy
looks like godmode
But ey
It looks like the absolute epitome of horseshit right now

but it's still better than the purely random system we've got right now
of course it wouldn't be always accurate with synergies and all
and to adjust item drops accordingly
That's something Psychotic was talking about for AB+. Each item would have a rank, similar to Gungeon.
that'd allow the game to have a rough estimate of how powerful you are
also i think a good way to handle item rarity would be to assign a rank to every item
just gotta throw some hyperrealism in
i mean that's already what the main menu feels like
the only way godmode would be better would be if it manipulated reality to punch you in the face as you start the game
godmode is like "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
more if youre lucky
so that you get a few strong ones at maximum
if base afterbirth is "ah, look at this"
ideally all items that are strong or better should be a bit rarer with the rarity increasing
the very special child of the community
godmode is like
True
very special
godmode itself is special
literally everything in godmode is special because have fun ever winning, right?
also even if the system was good most of the special items made no sense in wotl
because special items dont let you have EPIC SYNERGIES XDD
wotl one was much better
it's not very good
never really understood why they did it like that
but yeah the special system is very different from the wotl one
Thanks
I'm going to tweak the weight values a bit and test around
Yup, that's one of the main flaws of the Rebirth system
so isaac's d6 doesn't affect it
And in WotL there was basically a medium chance to get more than 2
not when you take it
oh also you probably know that already but the special stat decreases when a special item is rolled
well, more than two
so there's a very low chance you'll get two special items in the same run
ooh
and by fucking 5 every subsequent time
it gets divided by 2 the first time
So I could tweak the base weight of the special items to make it as close as possible to WotL
actually no it's even harsher than that lol
every time a special item appears, the special stats gets divided by 2
ah
their true weight is their weight * the special stat
well for special items
Only Mega Blast has less IIRC
Yup
most items have 1
okay you know how every item in the game has a weight?
you could see it as a chance multiplier that only applies to special items
But it doesnt use a formula as in WotL?
...nah that's a bit too obscure
it's the chance that a special item that spawns won't be rerolled into another item
you can see it as 1 = 100%
it's a probability
okay so, special stat starts at 1
hell if you said "special items are placebo, it's a placeholder stat" people still might believe you
yeah that's why i want to make sure
true though
lol
so
but you could do that and everyone would believe you because you're kilburn
let me make sure i'm not going to spew bullshit
actually hold on
in rebirth the special stat starts at 1
this is for wotl
The Special stat, which has a starting value of 0, is used for determining the chance that a special item will be created in an item creation process like the opening of a Golden Chest or the entering of an Angel Room. The lower the Special stat is, the higher the chance that a special item will appear.
Special and Item Generation

    When an item is generated, if it is not special, it is spawned.
    When an item is generated, if it is special, the chance that it is generated again is 1 - 1 / (1.2 + Special * 3).
        This means at the start, there is an 83.3% chance of keeping a generated special item, but after picking up just one, this chance falls to 23.8% 
    If an item is special and not obtained by a Deal With the Devil, Special is incremented by 1. My Reflection only adds 0.2 to Special.
    Samson spawns with Bloody Lust, meaning his special counter starts at 1 and therefore has a 23.8% chance to keep any special items which are generated instead of the 83.3% which all other characters start with.
Thats the thing I'm not sure about
Do  the special items have the same mechanic as in Rebirth?
Apropos special items, would it be similar enough to the original system if I just make all the items special that used to be or would that cause them to show up way too rarely?
yeah, keeper is too different
give him a special item so less show up or something
Keeper has even less luck but he wouldn't work in a *classic mode* mod
Maybe start the player as Lazarus
it'd be great if challenges let you give yourself a negative number of items
So it's not possible yet unfortunately
I dont think so
Because I think that only exists in pills
nope
Are there any luck down items?
Not sure.
Anyone has any idea how I could remake the 7 Years Bad Luck challenge in AB?
I'm an idiot ignore me
Oh it's in WotL
And what's so bad about the Dad's Key?
<@66197463593136128> The one makes you small pill probably came from a champion
add me to special thanks
Literally unplayable
<@173420370773147649> I got Dad's Key in a chest
add me to special thanks
you are worst mod
REMOVE CLASSICMODE remove classicmode
DELETING IT NOW <@173420370773147649>
WORST MOD
WOW
add me to special thanks
0/10 mod try again
<@173420370773147649> I just got a One Makes You Small pill in Classic Mode
`New post from /r/themoddingofisaac`

**How to edit a enemies actions ( How many bullets it shoots, if it explodes when killed, etc. )** *by Espeon101*
Just need to know, trying to make a mod
**Link** http://redd.it/4zqzlw
I've noticed that
Yep
And in the example of Classic Mode, boss portraits are the original boss that was in there
We noticed that when we were coding in the Hush replacement the game still showed the Hush portrait
Yeah, we noticed that when we were porting Godmode
Neat
Ah, so that could be changed
It chooses based on room subtype
<@173420370773147649> as far as I know
I finished the cellar now, i'm uploading the update later.
<@66197463593136128> So it chooses the portrait based on the room subtype...?
Yep
Considering WotL had all kinds of shop sizes
Just imagine the shop being one item smaller
Ofc
Ah
Removed batteries
Afterbirth goes by ID, you can replace portraits properly potentially
On another note, I found that shops sometimes sell nothing for 5c, I assume these are removed pills?
Yeah
Because I wanted to balance out how frequent bosses appear a bit
Noticed.
Rebirth and AB bosses arent replaced 1:1
Oh, as for the boss portraits btw
Of course the rooms would still be double but it would be a good way to remove the AB bosses.
That work that way
Heretic also adds more kinds of Stone grimaces
Yeah
Like the invincible Krampus in the Satan fight.
That's how Godmode was able to do a lot of the shenanigans it gets away with.
Mh, good idea
And I think they are.
Also. For Double Trouble rooms, make invisible, invincible, immobile versions of the bosses the room expects, and place them in the room. Then you are free to replace them with WotL bosses. The game will still open the doors despite two bosses still being "alive" because invincible enemies aren't counted in the room clear conditions.
That could work then
Are things like shots upon death also stored in anm2?
<@173420370773147649> What if you replaced the anm2 files with the originals? It's worth a shot.
Yeah
I don't really know if I could change that somehow
Thought so
There's no way to fix it.
<@154319740351938561> hardcoded.
Yeah
lol yeah
<@173420370773147649> Dunno if you are aware of this, but Flooded Caves still replaces chargers, mulligans and boom flies.
I still find it ironic that you have to buy a DLC to *remove* content properly <@173420370773147649>
But it shouldnt be too much of a deal breaker IMO
Yeah, I think it does that
i had it, and then enemies would randomly get frozen for a bit
True
Mh
i remember the first time i played afterbirth
also doesn't it randomly stun enemies too?
so they won't spawn
Lil Batteries are disabled
Well, I care about the random charge it ocasionally gives your item
Either way the battery comes out of the familiar
Yea
I could just test a bit
Make it passive and put it in the start room to test
there's a possibility that they coded it to be dependent on the item itself, not the familiar
Hmm.
actually, fuck, i'm having doubts now
Yeah, that works just as well
<@173420370773147649> just make the familiar invisible
Also that's what we thought
Trying to emulate the old battery effect for classic mode.
the familiar needs to be there for it to work
yeah it's tied to the familiar
Yeah.
are we talking about the battery familiar that spawns batteries every once in a while?
True lol
what does battery baby do already?
well i don't play afterbirth sooo
We figured you would know
<@167363485326508033> trying to figure out if the battery baby works as a passive item
Yeah since it's the familiar that seems to trigger the effect
who summons me
Nvm
<@167363485326508033>
Yeah, it might be dependent on the actual Familiar following you right
Kilburn would know for sure, most likely
I'm worried that as a passive it will have no effect
Dont need to worry about Lil Batteries spawning either
That works as well
<@173420370773147649> I don't know about that, but you can definitely reintroduce it to the pools and make its baby graphic invisible
To emulate the battery
They shows how long it's been since I played Flash.
Wait... couldnt I turn Battery Baby into a passive
Yeah. Forgot secret rooms didn't stay open too.
they had to add the health cap otherwise you would have infinite black hearts in every run
Old Battery
Also secret rooms staying open
Yea
Also wow I completely forgot the health cap doesn't exist in flash ?
It's close, and it runs way better than Flash does on the school computers
At least let me break the health cap
Eeeeeeeuuugh
Hopefully AB+ will be capable enougj
Its not full WotL yet tho :p
Because I'm too lazy to disable the mods
It's so nice having WotL back. I'm going to have two copies of Isaac on my flash drive, one with my "classic redux" mod collection and one with Afterbirth (people at school challenge me to an Afterbirth seed every now and then)
Cool :) I haven't played as Cain yet in Classic Mode, just Isaac, so I didn't notice lol
Thanks!
Made a to-do list with them and some other stuff in school
Actually saw them all
Last one is already there
<@173420370773147649> My Classic Mode suggestions got buried in <#205854501083545601>, so I've got a few. Adjust the friction of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse so they dash as quick as they did in WotL, remove Bloody Lust and replace it with Lusty Blood, rename Lusty Blood to Bloody Lust, make Samson start with Lusty Blood, and give Cain the PhD (just have his costume overwrite PhD costume if possible)
I know
I'd just include it, it's easy to remove if you dont want it
I also wanted to put a custom soundtrack from different games, but I don't know, if it would fit for a mod like that. Maybe i'll leave an extra folder with the music in the next update.
robobaby should say that when someone is shilling a link to their mod
butifile ?

I'm using a GUI archive manager called file-roller, it's been able to unpack everything I've thrown at it
oh ok
that's literally what I do though, I've never used the command line to do anything archive related
but nah thats not edgy enough
or you know you could just make a .zip file and drag and drop shit to it
hey you called it so I obliged
oh god dammit
`tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder_to_compress`
eh
*cough*
<@162156525337575425>
it would
that would be neat
Im drooling
Oooooo
If AB+ was advanced enough, one could make a full game randomizer
kek
change it to range up => ab+ DLC
Tears up
Makes sense
So I guess you could quickly expand that to automatically insert that between all the <Name> tags
here
Nicalis dlc generator
So yeah
You gotta guess what every item does because everything is nonsense
nicalis DLC generator
yes
I feel like such a tool would be fun
Ok, thanks
tip for images: colormatrix is fast and itterate over each pixel is more precice .
im pro at C# consult me if needed <:remSmug:215208672077414400>
alright
Im going to do some research on that tomorrow actually
Well, thanks to yall
doable but takes some lines of code. but ive done something similar (changing colors randomly)
That's the idea
Yes
are the recolored sprites randomly generated, too ? (changed color scheme, brighter, darker, etc. )
oh yeah definitely
I'd imagine that'd be more advanced
Another problem would then be replacing the item gfx with random recolours of existing items
Mh
just read it as raw text and replace name="shit" instances
you dont even need to read the xml as xml
that wouldnt be too hard really
More of a joke program
oh
A reskin generator so to say
oh
For example something that randomly fills the items.xml with random names
for items?
Nothing yet, but I'd need that kind of stuff to realize some of the ideas I had for random tools to do things
i dont have the C# editor source code anymore i couldve shown you how i did xml with that
so what do you need to edit specifically pm2k ?
Hex editor is best
lmao
Of course
microsoft paint is the best tool to edit xml files ?
notepad++ looks ugly
pls
Neckbeard
shills
sublime text 3
thats what i use
>notepad++
Well, notepad++ works too
i love C#
But yeah, Ive been trying to learn C# lately
i just edit that stuff with note pad and it works (xml, not css)
Ok
if you're doing it with C#, look into doing xml shit with linq
that was honestly the worst part of isaac editor
xml's easy
oh god
i can help you
With a program
Like accessing the xmls and editing stuff between tags
<@173420370773147649> what do you mean
true
I dont understand how to access and edit files tho
i also know lua
css + html = 0.5 languages in a port folio
<@162156525337575425> the UI part is easy
js doesnt count
learn a real language kid
Heh
<@205685896543076352> "only"
non stop googling
thats how i made both iterations of isaac character editor
i only know: batch, js, css, html, and tiny little bits of  java
My coding experience has mainly consisted of furious googling on how to do very specific things
Topkek
lol
thats why you need to learn how to copy paste everything from stackoverflow
i can only code simple stuff
im not a coding genius tho
But I havent bothered
I was gonna port it over to c#
http://camsweb.localtunnel.me/
ive done something like that too except in C# because im not gay
Yay
I coded a text-based console RPG in FreePascal
tbh id kill myself before writing a simple RPG engine in any language
i coded a web server
ik
Yeah, that was a joke
its simpler with those
kinda
+ why those when you can code for free
i cant afford it
:^)
Why code when you have RPG Maker(TM) and GameMaker (TM)
Yup
...
coding is for losers
im also into coding + lol ^
eggman, N to the Orthernlion Northernlion
lol
Variations: eggnog, eggloin
Egg is even faster :)
i pronounce it nether loin now, i just type to fast
lol
btw pm2k thats what i used to call him, usally because i used to not read the channel name correctly
...which was too difficult, so I uninstalled WotL and got gud
But yeah, same, I watched a couple of youtube videos and bought the game+WotL
i loved it, you get over the weirdness after a while
I'm calling him "Netherloin" from now on
it looked weird at the time, but i bought it and tried it
the first time i have ever heard of the binding of isaac, was when a couple nethernloin binding of isaac videos where i  my recomended list on youtube
afterbirth is the FINISH HIM shot
Thing is, Rebirth is already full with holes
wotl was a shot in the foot, afterbirth is a shot in the head when it comes to balance
While Afterbirth feels like a fanmade mod
It felt more like a real DLC
im saying based on the consept
Both kinda boned the balance but eh
depends
In my opinion
It was better than AB
its basicly afterbirth but for old binding of isaac
i forgot about that dlc
Fancy word for old isaac
o
Wrath of the Lamb
what does wotl mean
I just released a mod that at least changes the colours, gameplay and overall style to WotL-era
ik
People have started projects to flashify the game but theyre unfortunately all dead
i tried to find sprites, but i fond none
?
Eh? As in WotL
i always have wanted a true old school boi rebirth/afterbirth mod, not just music, but actual old sprites (and muisc)
Thats probably actually where I got that idea from
Heh, yeah
true, but the binding of undertale did that
While that works, Death's Touch is also a good item to replace with bones because of the spinning effect!

this is the dumbest i've felt in a long time, i thought why cant i just edit just the normal tears, i tried it and it worked
ill go try it right now
good idea, both of you ?
basic infos for that modding ideas: you can easily change the appearance an item gives you. but you cant edit the appearence of most tears
you could try editing the appearance effect to have isaac look normal
i just started about a week ago
thats what im wondering, whats a good item that wont change my apperance, but has an affect. or maybe i can make it so it wont change my apperance. idk im not the most experianced modder
of which item you want to change the tear sprite ?
can have some one help, i wanna edit an item's effect so it shoots bones, but wont change your apperance(i know how  to unpack, edit sprites and add mods, so thats not what im asking)
The title screen looks awful tbh
But yeah, I need to work on the UI
Hadn't thought of that
and add a blank afterbirth_unpack\resources\gfx\ui\main menu\splashes.png  to your mod. that will remove that tint stain from the main menu
At least most of em
I could do that probably
Mh
isn't xxxxxxxxxxxxxl just large marge
<@173420370773147649> will you add the classic challonges as well ?

if they weren't nicalis 9/11 wouldnt have happened
its purpose is to remove everything nicalis did
exactly
actually
then there would be no reason for my mod
if they weren't nicalis your mod would already be finished
if they wouldnt handle their boss rooms so weirdly my mod would already be finished
thats Nicalis for ya
wof
because nicalis
lol
were talking about nicalis here
this fucking missing no sprite is useless. why didnt they coded the same effect as an anm2 animation -.-
yep
the ones on the right are for teleportation, right
missingno and teleportation

**what in the world are these sprites for?** *by LuckyBoneHead*
So while I was working on Dunce (my monster for my mod), I noticed these jumbled pieces of sprites that are confusing me. (http://sta.sh/01s52mopfgie) I took a screen capture of the sprites, so if someone could take a look at them, I'd appreciate it!
**Link** http://redd.it/4zk4iy
so 16x16 to 32x32 to 64x64 and so on
or even if you did, you need to resize in a way that makes sense
you didnt use nearest neighbor did you
pls help me
A Q A P
Q
A
P
LOOK
that's why you go AQAP
Omg it looks even worse now
SMH
smh
>not going as quality as possible
just select nearest neighbor instead of best quality
when youre resizing something
dumb question but how do you put on nearest neighbour in paint.net?
uhm
git gud
NEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWW PIXEL ART TIME!
that means you suck rathern than the program
cause you suck at it?
thats your fault
thats why it sucks i guess...
paint.net defense squad
i didnt choose nearest neighbor option
paint.net is top tier pixel art software you fucking egg
its perfect for when you want to do something simple but dont feel like waiting a year to have photoshop to load
Just because you dont know how to use a tool doesnt mean it sucks
^
paint.net is great you fucking shill
what the fuck did you just say
I USED PAINT:NET IT SUCKS FFS
why would they do that
use it in their mod
how
purpose is for people to use it
i dont see any other purposes
oaml
lmao
<@162156525337575425> I am PRETTY sure that's the intended purpose.
XD
print it out and wipe my ass with it or what
what do you want me to do with the icon?
happy...
Changed the screenshots to the actual icon you download!
please gib seal of approval
my mod is literally just a txt file with the only thing in it being "é"
i know i'm just being an asshole
But the alt floors arent different
come on its pretty well made ;-;
>shitty
we don't need any more
we already have one shitty undertale mod
literally why did you upload this shit
what is the purpose of it?
honest question
oh
oh wow it is just a png
<@151780927066865664> That makes it worse
that better?
i call it the funny of butts xD
i changed it to sans in a hotdog costume
And you wont get the seal of approval if you dont upload an actual mod
download my mod it's just a jpeg of a butt
well
But this is a website for Isaac mods
where the fuck is Ikana
<@151780927066865664> Sorry man
what is it lel
It's literally just a random .png
I took the plunge and downloaded it
WOW
good ??????
_A_ icon
a icon
its A ICON
funny butt
it aint a mod
xd butts xdxddxdd
maybe a picture of the mod?!
umm idk maybe screens of the fucking mod?
so i used a butt
...ummm
i didnt know what to use as a  screenshot
cause
no one is even going to download it in the first place
you didnt need to include the "Credit me if you use this ;)"
why the fuck does it have a butt as a picture
yesh
the wisp icon
thats mai mod yes yes
yesh
pffffff
lol its already featured on best mods
character editor will never get featured
<@162156525337575425> i can smell the salt
you dont deserve it anyways
That's pretty guuud
Well then
Ah
we usually feature newer, unpopular mods

winrar is shit
or if ur on windows 8/10 you can just create a zip file like you can make a folder
:3
YEAH! xDD
Winrars great
Okay
you'll need to compress it into an archive file. you can use a program like winrar or 7zip
smh

Is there a thing that keeps track of items you have touched and what you haven't touched jet.(for 1001%)  I know there's a in-game tracker but it's not really good cuz it doesn't say what you haven't touched

**Can you change win streak number manually?** *by grizzlyguygaming*
Hey everyone! 

Kind of a unique situation I find myself in. I streak Binding of Isaac and recently had my game crash inside of a challenge room, which renders you unable to actually continue your game without it crashing. I had to start a new run and my streak reset to 0 but I never technically los
**Link** http://redd.it/4z9wxe
and there's no way to just get rid of double trouble rooms
if there's only one boss the game probably just flips out or something
that allows double trouble boss rooms to display two different bosses
it might be an issue with the new thing they added
ah darn, don't think i can help you with this one
Also the Afterbirth ones
Replaced then
did you completely remove the double trouble rooms or did you replace them?
Or something
"Can't find boss 6, double trouble 0
But it said something along the lines of
I dont have access to a PC right now

Can u change endings cutseens in the binding of Isaac?
?
A ROM map exists already, actually
http://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Kirby%27s_Adventure:ROM_map
And then by trial and error edit with a hex editor
I guess you gotta find out where in the ROM they are stored
though idunno how to change cutscenes
Ah

I can actually understand them and their cringeworthy fanbases
And some German youtubers
And tons of italian guys played it
ViteC or something
The same guy also played isek
but only like 350 downloads
And now they're increasing at a slow rate
The earthbound mod had a russian streamer play it and he got 14,000 views
They all came from the subreddit
Pretty much no additional downloads after he played it
*vinesauce played your game*
Nah
i bet
Vinesauce played isek which is where it all came from
I have 2500 *advanced users* downloading my mod
have played something i made
its not all noobies
i would because so many PEOPLE
lmao
I wouldnt be proud of 50000 noobies downloading my mod
wha
YOU KNOW IT MAKES YOU SAD?
OMG YOU ARE S A D DONT YOU DARE SAY SHIT ABOUT COMMENTS
For making a shitty tool
why are some of the commenters so dumb
why
man i feel so smug
the comments on the website are really dumb sometimes
no biggie only 50k downloads here
615 downloads
my is bloat mode
i used the character editor
it succs
my most downloaded mod iirc

Thats why I dont care to get more
wow pro
ipecac lost
then it was easy as shit
ffffffffffffu
with pre-afterbirth lost i literally just held R until i found ipecac
but pre ab lost naaaah
AB lost is gr8 fun
probably bugged
Fuck pre-Afterbirth lost
why
they're only gone from the profiles
And I don't care to get any more
but i can search my mods
i can still click on em from notifications
I only have platinum god
fucc
*where are my mods*
My mods are gone as well
and i can't remember my steem pass
god platinum god
i too don't have mods on my
i didn't even god platinum god
uhh my mods dissapeared from my profile is that bad
clap clap clap
dumbass
"i have 1001%ed it but i havent"
apart from the afterbirth challenges which i'm not doing they're bull
fucking weirdo
yes
question: have you 1001%ed it?
It's actually broken in terms of balance
i still love it
Isaac is a fun game though, even if it's not the most polished
ye i know what ur referring to
i dont even know lmao
As apps to open it in
My phone suggests google earth and maps
My first one was actually pretty okay
<@173420370773147649> fucking what lol
<@162156525337575425> why is that a google maps link
my very first mod was a better keeper mod
please don't burn me
_aaaaaaaaaa_
but remember, only these U did
for me it's i'm still making one
im sure its obvious which one it is for me
even though the earthbound mod was better
for me it's probly Playable bosses
For me isek
for me it's Bloat Mode
*looks at text-based FreePascal RPG*
isek
easily
Him? isek
what is the most famous mod u did?
*looks at code fragments*
yeah it doesnt matter at all but it still makes me feel hypocritical
That's just a tool and not a game
i mean i could talk shit about them all day but *looks at isaac character editor code*
Why does the game lag on N3DS
Why are the goddamned transformation names hardcoded
And it doesn't seem like Isaac's programmers are very competent
tho in isaacs case, shouldnt have been too much work
depends if its worth the time of writing your own engine
Because then you'd be limiting yourself
If you're a very competent programmer, you're better off using a custom engine rather than something like unity
The engine has nothing to do with that tho
gungeon's one of the most polished games i've ever played
imagine isaac like that
It would probably be better than the confusing mess of an engine that it's currently in
this game in unity would be gr8 actually
gungeon's unity
C++
im starting to think it'd run better if it was in unity
In C++ or C#
better than flash
aka shit
a custom made one
Custom engine
What engine is this game in
Hardcoded transformation names
But the game makes it all hard for me due to the shitty way it's programmed
the mod
uhh
who maked this server?
<@!150687833353486337> what
i dont even mod shit fuck are you talking about
Criticism is okay, doesn't mean you hate something
That makes sense
Because I'm trying to improve the game with my mods
We **are** this server pal
GREED BUTTE XDDDD
:????
why do you  mod this game if you hate on it so much
why? because we're not stupid 8 year olds? well sue us
its probably the worst of the subreddit
you two make this server Sad ?
Is the main tboi server as bad as the subreddit?
lemme guess its full of afterbirth apologists isnt it
>greentext
>main tboi server
dammit
what
no...
unbans?
and, more imporant thing, were there some unbans? ?
m e
who remembers me from main tboi server?
just cause i'm curious:
That username is triggering to me
*your* name triggers me and i don't complain
i did
Youre triggering me
Change ur username pls
Since they had struggled to break the encryption a few months ago
i dun no
It's pretty new tho, right
KSSU has an editor
some guy also figured out KSS hacking,  right?
i'm usin that

or just isaac
can we talk about modding other games
Fuck if I understand the shitty room subtype system
Literally just change a couple of double trouble rooms
what did you do?
don't change special rooms.stb then ?
Goes into an endless room generation loop, forcing me to hard reset the PC
It shits itself
I change the special rooms.stb
I am done with this game
Custom pill effects
Isaac is slightly green
oh its obvious
ill play around with the settings just to be sure
i'm pretty sure it's just tyrone being himself as usual
uh
ok
and a031 is just the build number
really though, isaac ng is just the internal name of the game
...
omg it says isaac ng!!!
dev build
a031
look at the top of the window
I know there is a secret somewhere
guys
now that's how you hype people up
i can't wait for ab+
man

**Mods suddenly making my game crash?** *by LuckyBoneHead*
I'm not new to modding, but I will admit that this issue is confusing me! I've had mods installed in TBoI before (with the Heritic mod being my favorite), but now when I try to install mods my game crash.

I do mean suddenly too, like this has been happening for an hour straight with a mod installed
**Link** http://redd.it/4z5jk1
What should maggy be...
No
is it possible to make a new tranformation in binding of issac
heck yes

give this man a seal

So...
thanks obama
hardcoded shit @nicalis
how does the Guardian Challenge work
but
o
shear of destiny can only be vield by characters who can shoot tears
For some reason it isnt showing up on my character
Spear of Destiny
Better idea
Not everyone gets fates reward right away
Uh I forgot
and fates reward doesnt have tear up effects
only one red heart
That's okay cuz Lillith is shit IMO
So a buffed Lillith?
That makes sense
Oh
On a normal char Incubus is basically 20/20
The Blind
uh
Isaac cant fire either
uh
Brother Bobby and Fates Reward
Lillith cant fire tears
No
Fate's Reward
Lilith is the exact same thing
uh
Nerf
OP
Brother Bobby and an Incubus
no
Starts with Sister Maggy and Brother Bobby and the Bible
I am changing Isaac into The Blind
I have trademarked shitpost mods
Im done
I'll sue you
Oh no lol
And if you wanna do that: Forget it
He still thinks you're making a shitpost mod
wut
Oh no
I started working on rooms
good
<@190495109748359168> How's it coming?
double click the door to disable it.
Otherwise it doesn't
You disable the door
how does it work when there is a pit next to a door
uh
ok whew
Eh?
Does that still reset it?
I ACCIDENTLY CLICKED ESCAPE
SHIT
Sorry mods
Ah
<@&206618799640674306>
Just tested
They do
Dunno honestly
do begottens just attach to the nearest wall
o
Yep
oh is that only for the special rooms file
You see these little icons?
Type.
type?
Then just set your room's type to Treasure room
thenks
ah
Edit special rooms.stb
Like the level of a shop room
How do I make custom treasure rooms?
It determines certain things
oh
Yeah
Then the room will display "Vs. Room One" when you enter it AFAIK
Room variant?
It determines which floor they are on
So if the room is Room One and it has super lust in it
What matters for bosses is the room variant
kk
Nah
What about bosses?
But miniboss rooms will display their room name when you enter them
thank go
Nope
do I have to rename each room?
ok
To throw the player a curveball
Make some rooms with Caves enemies or even a Depths enemy
Do it
I wanna make it a rare room so bad
Meme
Dreams come ture
Done
So basically nothing with unavoidable damage
But if your mod isn't fair it's shite
I am not a fair human
?
something that is challenging but fair ?
What shoudl my next room be
The thing is: I actually have to remove the middle pillars anyway for it to look like the original

What should this next room be?
Ok
<@173420370773147649>  https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/34bhi4/backdrops_explained/
Only on the corner
There should be less
aw fuck you ruined it fr me :(((
And the thingies on the walls are wrong
added those things
I'm pretty sure I can't fix that because it's hardcoded ?
kk
Well that's a game thingy
the golden thing in the middle is cut in half
Yeah
good but not perfect
holy shit thats good looking
blast to the past

same
die
:^)
ur a meme
also ur a tool
Download Isaac Character Editor.
*tool
<@162156525337575425> stop shilling your own mod

ima windo
https://moddingofisaac.com/mod/16/isaac-character-editor download ?
mateo
pm2k please
There is one, but the creator is sadly too lazy to make it Mac-compatible
lol
<@162156525337575425>
lol
one second
Also how come there isnt a character editor
but where
I understand that
Like on the north side
Confuzzled
Top side?
That's no good difficulty
Nah
So the player can't safely stand next to the rocks and wait
Change the rocks to metal so only Lost and Azazel can get to it?
I'd add another turret on the top side
Eh
Everyone hates boom flies.
Change the rocks to spikes? And add boom flies?
They're pretty powerful, especially in such an early floor
I'd personally make it even harder to get to the chest
I like Angelic chests
its off center
oh shit
Neat
hehe

So players actually encounter them
If you add less than ~100 rooms, it might be wise to crank their weight up by a bit
Tip:
I hope to add a tonne of rooms
kk
its nothin
Everyone has to learn first
Thanks for helping me, I am known to be horribly niave
Thanks
It's a pain in the ass otherwise
^
or edit them with this tool: https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/47qi1g/itempool_editor/
noice
So this is how synergy lab is made
kk
Or remove all from a pool
You can add as many items as you want
itempools.xml
You can edit those
What about item pools?
Awe rip
Not possible
I mean spawn once the room is completed...
It will appear in that room
...just place it in a room
How Do I make it do that then
That's jsut a pedestal item
Nah
No need to test more honestly
Is Collect what spawns after the room is completed?
That will suffice
Oh right, that existed
ANyway
I mean to MAKE SURE
I used that
or just use the test function...
right
o
By setting its weight to 1000
How do I make sure the room will work without having to play the basement 100 times
I never got a rare room
Woah
Open them in basement renovator
thats what my rooms are
Stb files
http://i.imgur.com/HyNzif4.gifv
...
Depends on the file type
Open it in an editor of your choice
ive done that already one time but the boss will not move anyways (or do anything else besides beeing killable)
So how to I load a file for editing
Ok
Just need to make an animation for him
Sure
you can add the Skinless Hush
holy shit
o
The Rebirth ones are included es well
No
ONly for afterbirth rooms i see
https://www.reddit.com/r/themoddingofisaac/comments/3ze00o/
link?
Uh
Ok
...yes
can you ADD rooms?
Everything you could possibly imagine
What can the current one do?
Just like the other tools
And the official one is probably gonna be worse than the one we have
Offical room editor
But we already have that
I am excited for the room editor
Oh I know
figuredd
One of the few things that has been confirmed for the AB+ API tho
nope
I assume you cant ADD challenges though
woo
Yes
It's common in programming to comment your code
can we edit challenges
Probably for later reference
Speaking of which
Like They explained the entire challenge format
How did they explain it?
and such
Yeah
for hidden characters
They basically said they didnt want anyone looking at the code
How so?
Its fucking weird that they basically explained how the boss rush ambush code worked
I just removed all new room layouts
<@173420370773147649> do you make the roomlayouts like wotlk, too ? or just the room sizes ?
you can edit the champion phases
Noice
lol
and get rid of lemon mishap
Do me a favour
But they are super rare
A lot less shitty items
Tbh I kinda like the closet rooms
No bullshit bosses
No sloggy big rooms
Also no bullshit small rooms
Yep
no null fucks
Ah
But not as many variants
Yes, one for every floor
not one for every floor
?
And they don't have their unique music in this mod
Ah
But there aren't as many super secret rooms as in Rebirth
noice
Those too
Yes
since WotL
What about bosses?
There are super secret rooms
Since I removed all the new rooms, yeah
Like Dips
And Did you also remove monsters?
there is one
There is not super secret rooms in Orig Isaac right?
Because the game likes to throw a fit
Figured
And editing the special rooms
The thing that took the most time was editing the backdrops
Eh
Just took a while?
So really easy
I literally just had to paste a single XML tag in front of every item
How hard was it to code?
Cool
Ah
It basically locks them behind an unobtainable achievement
The mod just prevents them from showing up in a run
The items don't really get deleted
Nah
and the item doesnt exist
Becuase of unlocks
How would it
Nope
Changed all backdrops to look like in WotL
Wouldnt that fuck up some saves?
and Rebirth rooms
EEyup
So you just deleted the rebirth items entirely
:^)
I wonder why
And you can't see any Rebirth items around
TBoI: CLassic mode
ah
AH
from WotL
Classic arcade
Whats new
Uh
`New post from /r/themoddingofisaac`

**Is there a way to implement flight on characters without adding items?** *by OnionDood*
From what I've saw, characters such as The Lost start with flight, but with no items to give flight. Can Im make this happen with other characters?
**Link** http://redd.it/4z1wrj
Very close to releasing this bad boy

I decided to wait until Afterbirth Christ comes out
Or music pack with custom title screen
Like maybe a reskin
Ive been planing on making a small mod
Since
And you're welcome
Takes less time than asking ?
You could also just search around the folders
Thanks!
gfx/ui/main menu
It says to go to gfx/ title screen/ main menu but i cant find any Title screen file in the gfx folder
I have no idea how to get the the main menu file
Cause i found a tutorial on reddit but
Does anyone now a tutorial for making mods with the afterbirth unpacker?
kk
no. the game will only crash when your xml files have wrong syntax, you fucked up some rooms or use entity ids that are not defined
The game is running so does that mean the mod will work?
Ok
you only have to move the changed sprites into the resources folder. not all of them
kk
yes.
So just click no?
no.
So Im trying to drag the Graphic.a contents into resources and it comes up with the replace command, do i replace?
uh
k
this contains files that cant be extracted by ricks unpacker. they contain some item sprites and random animation sheets but nothing that is needed for most of the mods
What about the UNKNOWN file?
kk
all xml files must be placed directly in the resources folder.
What about the XML files?
just drag out the files into resources and they will be read?
Basically
ok so
they must be placed in the right folder. for example you want to change the sprite of isaac. that file can be found in     resources\packed\afterbirth_unpack\resources\gfx\characters\costumes
so you must place your sprite in the same folder, in the resources folder. it must look like this: resources\gfx\characters\costumes
the name of the changed sprite must be exactly the same as the unpacked sprite.
How do I make sure my edited files are read?
Ok.
you can do that for better file searching but thats not needed
Dont I need to merge them?
unpack the "afterbirth.a" file for afterbirth sprites, and graphics.a for rebirth sprites. best is to unpack both and then first look into afterbirth_unpack  folder for your file, and if you cant find it there, look into graphics_unpack
What do I need to unpack?
Yea.
first: do you know how to use ricks unpacker ?
ok. i can do that.
I simply dont understnad what to do... Maybe you could guide me along better?
what is the question you have regards afterbirth modding ?
but introducing Afterbirth fucked up my mindset.
I know the file changing
Just change textures and text
what do you want to do exactly ?
I want to try to mod again but its so confusing
hi
Hello
why change pictur
Really?
no sleep at all is better

Im just shit at spriting and its midnight
Not Quit
quit after 1 day nice
<@190495109748359168> fuck me all my time
well ive used fl for years and im really used to it
I guess
But thanks
for now
I kinda quit this modding bs
bai
Different UI. After using ableton religiously for yeas, I can't change
they are the same basically tho
Every day
Ableton all day
its great
why not
Why do you own FL Studio?
i personally hate pixely music with a  passion lol
I turned off the sound and listened to Spotify
then again all of the sound effects in my game/mod are from a plugin for flstudio called "sytrus"
classic has such bad (bfxr.net) sound design
I played classic for a while, got boring
spelunky wasnt that great imo
Yep! And spelunky
downwell?
But isnt
Looks like a mobile game
That falling one that's like 2 bucks on steam
I loved hyper light
hyper light drifter has such good art style mmmm~
Mostly one person
And hotline miami
Was good
made by 2 ppl
And INK
Undertale was extremely indie
also hyper light drifter  was made im gms (REALLY under rated game)
That doesnt rotate it smootly
Oh, yeah I'm thinking of gimp
click on the corners when selected
I know, that's not what I meant by indie titles
Jack that doesnt exist
Undertale was made in gamemaker
Rotate tool
o
Just the selected part
?
Not the WHOLE IMAGE
aand it has options for rotae either wa
I wasn't talking about undetale
go to image at the top
kk
i dont really want to get into a argument but i personalky thought undertale was shit
in Paint.NET
How do i rotate an image by 90 degrees
ye nuclear throne n hotline miami 2
Undertale is a major one
Some big indie titles have been made with it.
GM:S is surprisingly capable
everyone hateed me for using gm:s before
I use unity for 3d and GM:S for 2d.
<@!181224364388253696>  what do u even make games in (assuming unity or somet
?
yayyyy
He shits for cying
I somehow turned Isaac into a ballass
Well
In Unicode, not sure why Discord wouldn't have it.
?
It's a puking emoji
Shit
nice square
?
dunno i think its 16bit but upscaled
8 bit, 16 bit, or high def?
if i showed u the art style u would laugh urt ass off
You made good art for ToS
nope
Good art.
i have a few music people but everything else is all me so basically, its gonna suck but might have good music
I prefer to stay 1-2 man indie, however.
Major in game design, does not require coding knowledge, and you make up the games that people make for you.
so ill work at wendys or soemt
i want to be a game dev as a job but that will NEVER happen
i wanna drop out but my parent wont let me rip

Now time to turn Isaacs head into a ballsack.
http://www.getpaint.net/doc/latest/KeyboardMouseCommands.html
TIL that there is binds for these
I found it in the online documentation
Def K
its k for me
i meant as in "Oh"
Not O or K
Nope
No, not o, K
o
It is K <@190495109748359168>
K
i just use the little bar
i dont evbe know
is there one
Whats the keybind for colour picker in Paint.Net
They're OK but not as bad as rpgmaker games
it started out in unity then i realized "oh shit i cant code"
I make games
the art style is downgraded in the game so its even uglier <:preLIKE:210764017470406656>
iunno
<@162117085428842496> maybe I can help?
<@162117085428842496> especially if ToS never gets completed
i use rpgmaker cuz i cant code and it will probably make my game be shit
XML editing might as well be C++, right?
heretic is miles better than tos will ever be
nah
You are amazing at modding
i cant code at all, unless xml editing counts
What should Ballsack look like
You made ToS
Lmao
I am not amazing at coding
espessially art
i suck at everythingt related to modding
i suck at amn2 editing
That's no fun
They take effort
Most people don't use them though
they can do so much
Not to give a shit about anm2s
I decide

<@162117085428842496>
Bye music
Anm2s are animations <@190495109748359168>
Opens xmls and anm2s
https://notepad-plus-plus.org
Tell me what i need it for a tleast
Get it
no
Do you have np++
ANM2 files
Elaborate?
I cant even open half of the files
<@162117085428842496> Why? I guess it doesn't matter now ?????
<@190495109748359168> Copy the contents of the new gfx folder paste in the old gfx folder and say replace if prompted
those ones were never used
@Appa didn't you have some originals on your YouTube?
ffs
The old one, but you have to combine them first. I'll tell you in a sec
gtx 750ti    /s
btw i was gonna make a soundtrack for tos but it was shit so it was never heard
Which GTX do I edit then??
Keep that
Do I also delete the graphics folder?
To recreate
For example
Or keep it
Yeah
Not config.a
So Do I delete the other config folder?
The xmls from afterbirth.a
What am I supposed to edit?
I am confused as shit
The sheol is easy as shit
Also sorry
The Sheol = FUCKING HELL
FUCKING HELL
Yeah
But kinda
For not telling you
dunno i get a thought in my head then i decide its retarded
<@190495109748359168> kinda my fault too
<@162117085428842496> I swear to god why do you never finish typing.
Did I just ruin everything i just did
That crashes it
It seems that you are using rebirth xmls for ab
Unpack afterbirth.a like you did the others


Whoops
Oh
Its still fucking crashing
that stuff goes into the root resources directory with packed
From the resources folder in those folders
THERE IS FILES CALLED RESOURCES IN THE FOLDERS GODDAMNIT
Not from resources to there
From the folders to resources
Do I just take the Resources file and drag it into there
Take the stuff from the "unpacked" folders and put it into resources
So
What
Take all of the folders and xmls from config and graphics into resources with packed
resources

Or maybe just screen cap your file structure
gonna take a bit
Resources
Not packed
Wait
Zip your packed folder and DM it to me I'll check it out
My card is still the Hanged Man even when I edited to Cut your head off
But it istn working
Therefore deleting them will just make the game not playable.
Files you didn't edit it will load from there
The packed files get overwritten by your files
Keep it or the game will crash
Do I remove the Packed fle or something?
G ame
They reload when you start the fame
As long as they are in the resources/gfx or resources for xmls they will work
My files
Use what stuuf
Cuz Hanged Man is still depressing
How do I make the game use my stuff
For kids
Fun cards

k den
Oh you got it.
Inside graphics and config unpacked there are folders and xmls. To make the game use them, drag the aforementioned folders / files into resources
tbh Im just gonna make a shitmod
got Graphicsunpacked, config unpacked and packed now
Get all of the folders and files in the unpacked folders and move them to resources.
for afterbirth
now whag
I have the corresponding files with the _unpacked after it
kk
It should take about 10 seconds, and then the window will close
One at a time
Drag graphics.a and config.a onto it in any order
What order should I do this
Ok
Yes
?
Gibbed.Rebirth.Unpack
That wat u need
Gibbed is good
The rest has Gibbed behind it
RebuildFileLists
RebuildAnimaionLists
ah
I meant in the bin of Rick's <@129339380090404864>
i dont think there is a rebirth.a
List the exes in the folder bin
there isnt a rebirth unpacked
fuck sake
this is how the end result looks for me http://puu.sh/qJNLb/f03c43dcd4.png
<@190495109748359168>
One at a time
Then let the command line run
In the Rick's unpacker bin folder
Unpack
Onto rebirth-upack
Drag graphics and config
Export the file
so...
it clogs everything up
also I would reccomend not unpacking the animations one
What do I open with the unpacker
uh
Yup
afterbirth has some updated materials etc
No tools
Hmmm
be sure you unpack the afterbirth one last and then merge it with the others
```You might wonder how you can open those .a files. Currently there are no
tools available, and there is a reason to it.

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has a lot of content that is unlocked as you
progress. It also contains some secrets.
We felt that having a folder with all the spritesheets, cutscene videos,
data files and whatnot would be too tempting for people to ignore.
Finding out things while playing the game, either alone, with friends,
or as part of an online community can be a very rewarding experience. We
don't want to take that away from you.

In case you like reverse engineering and absolutely want to take this
beautiful game apart, we would ask you a few things.
 - Don't release any secrets you find to the internet.
 - Don't publish information on how to open the game's data files.
 - Don't give away the unpacked resources.
The least you can do is wait until the game has been released for a
couple of months, so you don't accidentally spoil it for others.

If you have any questions, write to isaac@nicalis.com.```
this is a nice touch btw
one moment
Drag the graphics and config onto the rebirth-upack program
unpack those with ricks unpacker
afterbirth_a and such and such
Right now there is nothing but a flie called Packed with some random files
Ok...

http://puu.sh/qJNAY/5418134fa7.png ?
not on my screen!
Is the resource file just everything
Beat ya to it <@129339380090404864>
http://puu.sh/qJNys/94acc61972.png put your files here
Put them in the resources folder of your steam game directory
sry
meant
But how to I include them in the mod I meatn
xmls are in the resources folder
Ricks
Jack but what if I want to change XMls
<@190495109748359168> Rick's unpacker can be downloaded at http://svn.gib.me/builds/rebirth/rebirth-r50_b47.zip
you can probably make him start with 1
Health wise
Is Keeper locked to coins?
also if you're doing some more complex reskinning you will probably have to modify xmls
All i wanted was hearts and starting items anyway lol
anything beyond starting items/hearts isnt possible
you could modify their starting items, iirc
Only through giving items, yeah.
Starting items?
You cant
I want to change some char stats
you can use rick's unpacker (i think thats what it is called) to extract rebirth/afterbirth textures
You don't need to change xmls to replace graphics
I have an editor than can change xmls
It not suck
I just want to figure out how to get the files, and how to recode the xml files.
I love it
<@162117085428842496> Its still my favorite mod, always will be.
i made tale of samuel but it suck
its also not too late to be the creator of the first good huge mod
_im here_
Thats why
I know
o u mentioned my shitty mod
You can do that
Yes
everything
Mostly graphic mods, along with music and HUGE mods such as Godmode, ToS, and the Agony of Isaac.
and
I just want to reskin characters and enemies and rooms
im probably the worst modder on the wbesite so i cnt help much
and you can modify enemies somewhat
you can change sprites and sounds and rooms

**MissingHUD2 not working** *by hyperhumanimal*
So I finally decided to get MissingHUD2 in order to see my stats more specifically. However, the game doesn't seem to like that, since when I ran MissingHUD2, it threw an error and quit immediately. Here's the log file of the event:

Concancenate them with a comma after each one
Like get all the names between the name tags
Other than that I'm not too sure
You could write a script that pulls all item names out of items.xml
easily
does anyone know how to get a comma separated list of all items in the game

godmode
GODMODE?
but can you remove...
goddamnit
Of course you can't remove pills without afterbirth
Crash does seem to be consistent with the seed
"not enough dead ends, trying to make new one
placing rooms...
Caught exception, writing minidump..."
but you can always look into the log files
Second
i know it crashes before you get to see the seed
I can do that
have you checked if the crashes are consistent with the seed?
shush you
and instal
uninstall
No crash
I've restarted about a 100 times with just the edited basement file
i know how
waait
Yep
hmm
oh really?
it probably happens only when the floor contains a large room
Doesn't happen at all if I disable the edited special rooms file
well that makes sense
And that doesn't happen every time
hmm
oh
isaac-ng.exe has stopped working
does the game crash or does it completely close?
The loading screen comes on for a split second
what happens when you start a run?
Maybe including a single large room of every type in the basement could work
they fucked that feature up
well for all we know
Ah well
Seems like it still doesn't work
i'm not sure whether that includes the special rooms or not
all i know is that the level generator isn't supposed to generate big rooms if the room files don't contain any
i'm not so sure anymore
as for what i told you about the big rooms earlier
Thanks a bunch for the help
I'll try fiddling around with that a bit
smart
it will never end and you'll never be able to enter it
never tried doing that myself though, but in theory if you make the open animation loop
actually i think you might be able to make the black market trapdoor impossible to access by modifying its animation file
well they're grid entities, which is something somewhat different from regular entities, you can't really customize those
mh
neither is the black market trapdoor actually
and uh
boss rush entrance isn't an entity
the rooms will still be generated and if they dont exist you fucked up
Are they even entities
And then make these big rooms small
Couldn't I theoretically "remove" the black market trapdoor and boss rush entrance entities by making them too small to access (like the guy who made the Mystified mod made did)
no exception
looks like you have to remove all large rooms
well that's the thing
Isn't that just boss rush and the black markets?
have you tried removing all large rooms from special rooms.stb?
oh
As soon as I put the special rooms.stb in (where I didn't remove any large rooms) it crashes
What's weird though: It doesn't seem to crash when I just put the edited basement.stb in
Thanks
Ah well
and if there are no large rooms to pick from, it will just give up and abort
it will generate large rooms no matter what
but last time i checked
hold on i'll have a quick look at the level generator
Already seemed like it
i think you might be shit out of luck
Yep
okay so, you want to remove large rooms right?
Well, using Afterbirth is kinda pointless when all I want to do is removing things
yes
oh my god
he is using rebirth as a base
<@167363485326508033> Can you help me? You're like the master of modding (and I'm using Rebirth as a base)
The problem definitely lies in the special rooms.stb
Nevermind, it also crashes sometimes when starting a new run
I can start a run and play the first floor just fine
Oddly enough it only crashes on the second floor
I'll run some more tests and see if it could be caused by something else
Mh
the game should not care. the only critical large rooms are greed room and hush floor rooms
AFAIK the game ocasionally has problems with stitching together the floor layout when it has no large rooms, right?
Just deleted them in basement renovator
how did you removed them ?
@here Is there any way to do that without the game crashing?
I hate how the game throws a fit when I remove all large rooms
kinda neat actually, never thought about that
and start reading weird stuff in memory
so if you put an invalid subtype you essentially go out of bounds
that's because the coin values are stocked in a fixed size array

where can we collect those kind of informations ? i found a pickup that is not pickup-able XD
And you could add a different sprite for it as well since it's a whole new subtype so that's good
A super rare secret room variant.
Might be useful, actually.
O_O if you create a penny with subtype 7 you get a penny that is worth 99 pennys ... thats weird
Because if it wasn't for Binding of Avalice consuming most of my free time right now, I'd seriously take up the mantle on that.
Is Binding of Earthbound dead?

**I'm looking for some people to help me out with my new mod. Spriting and such.** *by PewdiepieSucks*
So I had an idea for a mod, a Steven Universe mod. It's a pretty popular show and I think an isaac mod for it would be nice. Problem is, I suck at spriting, and need Help. It would change the majority of the bosses and enemies, and some items, and the floors. If you're interested we have a discord.

I will continue to work on it, so that it will be ready to use once i come back in 3 weeks
how long will you be on vacation ?
I could describe the current function here for Wofsauge, but I will go on vacation in a couple of hours and there i will most likely not have internet
I would create a  page in which I would describe the general design of the api and the different calls, once it is in a somewhat complete state
<@206694318684110849> how were you planning on dealing with documentation for the api?
awesome
yes i would like to do that ?
"akin to" means "similar to" or "like"
whats an "akin" ?
good to hear
That part of the API should be already working, except that it is currently impossible to create a app via the website
and make it official
would you want to work with us to add in a downloader akin to <@206694318684110849> 's
no?
<@174193097285173250> is your mod loader using the official api?
Turbo Pascal if he wants a faster paced song
he should start with assambly to get a good beat
Ooooh, he's gonna have to learn a couple of programming languages for that one
gonna code some new songs

And Tyrone just keeps posting screenshots of the same old stuff to placate the people
actually
and the music is complete fucking garbage
but from the videos it makes my head hurt

it looks like it could be fun
to be honest i'm looking forward to the new time fcuk

This whole lack of information on any of their projects really makes me think they're just constantly slacking off
but i wish it was dead
eh theres still blog posts about it

i just hate how edmund stops working on cool shit and then goes "oh lets make legend of meme xDDDDDD everybody likes le bumbo amirite? upvotes to the left"
Mh
when you snort coke during the weekdays and then shit out some code on the weekend its not surprising
It's just miraculous how Nicalis manages to make stuff so slowly and yet so badly
but its not worked on by nicalis or team meat so maybe theres hope
im scared time fcuk 2 or whatever is gonna be shat on too
ab+ developement just takes to long already. it will be released december or so... thats to slow
...which seems like it's dead pretty much as well
which seemingly disappeared off of the face of earth
and then meat boy forever
yaddayaddayadda
me too...
But uuuguhguhgu Afterbirth
I was so hyped
^
mewgenics is cool
edmund just fuck off and make mewgenics already
Yeah
i doubt afterbirth+ is gonna cause a spike as huge as that
Look at these spikes at the bottom
https://steamdb.info/app/250900/graphs/
especially considering how shit afterbirth was
yeah
Surprisingly few
According to steamdb, about 7000 people
like who the fuck cares about isaac still
tbh i wonder if afterbirth+ is even going to sell well
yes
Too intensive for a console which can handle 3D open world games
Afterbirth is already very resource-intensive
Riiight
XDDDDDD
>implying the engine will handle that
>20000 reskins
And the credits get replaced with Tyrone giving you the finger

I'm going to make a mimic heart pack

now thats more like it

no way they'll sell a modding dlc without a way for normies to find mods
there definitely will be steam workshop support
That comes with drag-and drop modding tools
i wonder if there will even be steam workshop support
And Steam Workshop will inevitably turn into cancer after a while
actually you might be right, the mainstream community is a little bit too forgiving sometimes
either way they'll probs shift modding focus to workshop and no one will give a shit about the community made editors and shit
You're probably right anyway
hmm
<@167363485326508033> Mmmh... thing is that the "mainstream" community would probably forget about it after a while and just placate themselves with edgy reskin & stat-ups mods
well they arent making a character editor so im safe
imagine the community backlash
i doubt he'd try to take them down
please no
Wouldn't surprise if he tries to take them down or just deem them "unofficial" and thus unsupported once AB+ comes out
meanwhile ab+ is going to fuck my editor up fam
with the only exception being the animation editor
the good thing of my itempool editor is, that i dont have to change anything for ab+ support. everything should work directly from the release of ab+
i wonder if tyrone realizes that we already have a superior version of all of their tools
yes
basement renovator also looks loads better than the official editor
ok that only means less "mac version pls" directed at me
If you're okay with not getting credited
id just take a picture of my editor and say "hire me you fuck"
"I'm blocking u!!!"
You'll feel Tyrone's maturity
Say that to him on Twitter
the official one reeks of "im made in java"
definitely
i think my itempool editor is better than the official one ?
just make my character editor official you shills

The game wouldn't "not like it", it would just not know what to do with it. The things an item does are linked to its ID. It would still probably crash though.
Okay

And the game wouldn't like that.
Well, then you're "adding" an ID.
Cant do it right now because orientation
But what if you changed the ID of the Trinket to be beyond the Mega Blast and make it a passive?
Resulting in a crash similar to those found when trying to actually add challenges and characters.
I think if you did that the game would be confused because it doesn't count trinkets as items.
I don't think so.

it stores boss VS screens, too. so if you enter a boss battle, it will display "Isaac vs Super envy" the whole time you fight, till you traverse to the next stage
Then again, we said that about editing entities, too...
In that case, I think it's pretty cool it's possible, but I don't know how inherently useful it is.
yes but since the text is the same object as the floor name it will get overriden every time you pick something up
It would be sort of useful to have the floor name persistent like that.

Didn't you and someone else figure out 3DS modding a while ago? <@66197463593136128>
ok thanks
thats right <@66197463593136128> . i will update External item descriptions and many other mods of me when AB+ is out, so it will be compatible with other mods.
<@142091464061616128> : for now i would recommend installing external item descriptions first and then Binding of mario. this will override some item descriptions and the special rooms file, which only creates more space between spawned items in shops&co.
I assume <@174193097285173250> is going to update External Item Descriptions when AB+ comes out to work universally with other mods.
I would not recommend trying to merge two mods with each other. External Item Descriptions and The Binding of Mario both override the item pictures, so without a lot of manual work they're not going to play well with each other.
<@&206618799640674306> Hi I need help with using 2 mods at once.

Okay
it is currently impossible to create completely new items. thats because we can only modify sprites and xml files that are used for naming and source assignments. you have to wait till afterbirth+ to be able to add new items

Okay, so I'm brand new to modding isaac and need a little help getting started, does anyone know if there's a video or anything I can read that will give me an in depth tutorial on how to begin modding.  I've gotten as far as downloading Rick's Unpacker and looking through the files (My goal is to make an item)
(I apologize for that IM wave btw)
Oh. I see.
yes i will replace the old ones with new ones. that will make the mod more compatible with other mods and it will look like the same bar, not like 50 different bars for each item
I think the CHARGED! one was better than the classic gauge, so I believed that it may disappear.
not DANGER! Sorry.
CHARGED!
Wait.
I assume not, cause there's no need for twos. Or I am just wrong.
I consider asking, Is the gauge under DANGER! one will appear in the next update?
thanks
I really wanna say thanks for making such a thing, It makes my gameplay cool
Ello Wofsauge, Imma a big fan of yer brimstone gauge
how much abouth the head should the new bar be ? like the old one ?
Jerb knows nothing
tried that right now. it doesnt  look that good ingame
How about black to green?
True.
nope. thats not very productive. that would suggest the wrong thing
Good
Maybe start green then fade to red?
any other tips ? maybe a different sprite for that bar ?
Yeah.

If that makes sense, that is- I'm not very good at explaining things ?
I'm liking the new animation, but I think to help make it more clear when it's charged, make it fill in to a pre-existing bar from the center instead of growing the closer it is to being charged.

spear of destiny is specifically hardcoded to always show up in the guardian challenge
also i just looked it up
and it'd still do damage
plus you'd still have the knife
i can't think of any right now
Is there a way to make the character unable to shoot that?
So 
All i can think of is Moms Knife
Is there any items that disable tears?
Hmm
*didnt know that*
fuck
__didnt know that__
Actually, 400 is the Spear of Destiny
Okay huh
i wouldn't be surprised if that was the case
sounds like it's all hardcoded to me
Im gonna try something
Hmm
Those starting items; none of them have the Spear of Destiny ID
it shows isaac, not lilith
you can also see it in the stage transition screen
it's isaac
no playertype mentioned
<challenge name="The Guardian" id="30" endstage="8" roomfilter="4" achievements="4" startingitems="281,276,184,400" canshoot="false"/>
I don't know at this point.
Everyone always said it was actually Lilith.
Huh.
that i know for sure
because lilith is hardcoded to have an incubus familiar
if i remember correctly guardian is in fact isaac
so
and that's Lilith
i wouldn't even be surprised
Guardian has Spear of Destiny
but it's afterbirth so eh
Wait, maybe not.
that sounds stupid
k
<@66197463593136128>, you are now Level 8.
I think it's like Mom's Knife- the Incubus gets it.
just out of curiosity, what happens if you give the spear of destiny to lilith?
Any other ideas? :/
A creative solution but i would rather keep scythe tears
hahaha i guess
<@174193097285173250>, you are now Level 3.
then do the thing for scythe instead of pupula.
since scythe tears take priority if i remember correctly
getting something like death's touch would probably break it though
thanks XD
that's a pretty creative solution lol
pupula duplex because this entity is only used by one item
that's some serious hacks right there
first add pupula duplex item to the character. then changing the "Pupula Tear" entity  to have 1000 friction, invisible sprite and no collision. player is still able to shoot but tears will instantly clip out of bounds.
how would you do it?
(without canShoot variable)

<@124170727225163776> do you want to use spear of destiny with that character ?
it wouldn't make a difference
it's just a visual thing
plus
and it's not something you can give to a character via its id
it's a "null item"
well if we're gonna go into technical details
eh
it's not an item
(yes, there's an actual blindfold item, but it is in no pools and is only used for challenges.)
Have you tried adding the blindfold item to the character but leaving shooting on?

weird. the program does its job for terraria, but not for isaac...
If that's the case <@174193097285173250> you'll have to extract the SWF from the EXE (there's youtube tutorials on that) then decompile the SWF to get the vectors
Like exe wrapping, non-DX9 windows, etc
There are some places where it can't do textures
Yeah, that's more than likely the reason
¯\_(?)_/¯
but I'm not an expert on that so
Could be because the EXE is just a flash wrapper
Then it closes, and reopens to Isaac
Direct Injection should only appear for one frame
Strange
done that but the hook injection is named "direct injection:"  in my program
Assuming it can capture vectors at all.
And to save all textures
**Remember to save it as png**
...Imagine FP is Isaac
Once you get this screen, set it up exactly like this. The directory doesn't matter, as it places the textures in there
done. what to do next ?
Once you have added the game to uMod, run the game through uMod, and not anything else
Alright, then it should work
so you're good
Last I checked Flash uses DirectX 9 for rendering on Windows
yes it has
I haven't played Wrath of the Lamb at all, so does it have the buttons on the top right?
Another way it won't work is if it isn't in DX9 (with the minimize, maximize, and close buttons) but considering that many competent devs use it in windowed versions of the game, that probably isn't a problem.
You add the game to uMod, and you *have* to go to the directory it is in, and not any Steam shortcuts. Otherwise, it will not work
done. whats next
You place them in the Wrath of the Lamb directory where the .exe is
So, in the folder, there's some hooks
Alright, so, let's get things started:
ive followed the instructions in the readme but it doesnt download any textures from the game
yes please ?
NP, man. If you want, I can teach you how to set it up correctly
thank you for that program ?
ESPECIALLY if you want your BoI mod to look like something else
Seriously a legit helpful tool
Here's a download for it just in case.
good thing on that, i AM an ANM2 wizard ?
Keep in mind you need to actually get the SWF first. It's extracted from the EXE to one of the temp folders at run time.
But yeah, if decompiling the SWF doesn't work, get the uMod extractor
*dance music plays*
Non-AMN2-Wizard party!
Woo!
Yay!
Well hey, neither am I!
¯\_(?)_/¯
yeah I'm no anm2 wizard so
You could try decompiling the SWF and get the vectors that way
Jerbear, it can work, though it requires wizardry in .anm2 files
It's the tool I use to rip Freedom Planet's textures for Binding of Avalice
And vectors won't necessarily agree with the Rebirth engine. Don't even think Afterbirth+ can help that one.
Yeah.
BE SURE you save it as PNG, because by default they are vectors.
However, you have to actively play it
There, it will extract all the sprites, as long as you save it as .png
As far as I know, since I don't have the flash version of Isaac (you're talking about Wrath of the Lamb, right?) then I'd recommend uMod, place the hooks into the games directory, and launch it from uMod
does anybody know how to get the sprites from the Flash version of isaac ?
guess not
Anyone wanna read it?
In fact, I have a whole intro dialogue just for the mod

His positive pill effect is him twerking
Mowgli is in there too
Oh don't worry
Add in Bootleg Twerking Simba and I'll be satisfied.
Magdalene will be Domkey Kong
The main star is obviously Grand Dad
it'll be The Binding of Bootlegs
it'll be grand
yep
I have failed
HOW DID I NOT GET THAT JOKE
OH
Flintstones?
if i do say so myself
it's pretty grand
Looks hot.
This is part of another WIP mod I've had going on. Don't expect it to be released any time soon, though
You mean this kind of double negative?
double negative

Here's a video I made of BETA 2
That is, of course, unless you count the shitposting I've done
The vids I have are of a REALLY old Alpha, a BETA trailer, and the BETA 2 trailer
Shitposting never hurt nobody
...Most of the time it's shitposting though
I actually have a channel where I sometimes upload stuff related to the mod
Also, thanks for the compliment on the mod!
The lighting is because Camtasia is horrible at gif making
Wow, interesting hud and lightning
A small hat test (Isaac to Dark Judas)
sure
Who here wants to see a picture of my mod
